<h1>&#039;s Hand in Our Lives - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>SGS:</b>We are so grateful for the blessing of being with you this morning as we begin winter semester. We like the new beginnings, new routines, and new opportunities that are part of this time of year. We are glad all of you are with us. We are also happy for those who have chosen to begin their missionary service with the recent announcement made by President Monson.<br><br><b>COS:</b>During general conference this past October, we were very interested in the many references, both direct and indirect, that assured us of the continued influence of heaven in our lives. We believe this is true for us individually, for us as a Church, and also for us as the BYU community. Lest any be confused or misled, I am not suggesting that our agency is compromised or limited. In fact, our agency or responsibility to make proper choices is a fundamental and inescapable doctrine of our Heavenly Father's plan. Likewise, it is also essential we understand that in our mortal probation we are entitled to have the interventions of "the hand of the Lord" in our lives when we live so as to merit such blessings.<br><br>Usually, at least in our experience, the touch of the Lord's hand is soft and subtle--so soft and subtle that we may not recognize it. Happily, in necessary situations our experience can be as that of Ezekiel when he said, "The hand of the Lord was strong upon me" (Ezekiel 3:14).<br><br><b>SGS:</b>What is increasingly clear to us is that as we reflect on what has transpired in our lifetimes and in yours, we have been influenced more than we previously imagined by the blessings and guidance available to us in answer to our prayers. How this happens occurs in multiple ways. We believe in the scriptural assurances of the ministering of angels. We also know that the Holy Ghost has a tremendous influence in our lives when we live so that such help is appropriate. We also understand better as we get older that often the help we need is provided by our loving Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior, through other people who have been prompted to help, guide, and rescue us in times of need or consequential decision making.<br><br><b>COS:</b>As President Henry B. Eyring recounted the special events that led him to surrender his tenured faculty appointment at Stanford University and took him to preside at Ricks College (see "Where Is the Pavilion?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 72–75), we have reflected on our own experiences. In some ways what has happened to us is very different and in other ways is exactly the same as has unfolded for others. A common characteristic in our case seems to be that we recognize the hand of the Lord much better in retrospect than while interventions are actually taking place. Another is that the Lord's hand often is so gentle that what happens seems to be usual in the normal course of current events but later turns out to be of very great import. Likewise, when we have not been careful to acknowledge or recognize the reality of our blessings, we have been tempted to conclude that a special outcome was only the result of our own careful thinking, efforts, or strategy. We now confess that we fully believe that rarely, if ever, do good things happen to us without the influence of the hand of heaven.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Please forgive a few personal examples. We just recently celebrated our forty-eighth wedding anniversary. When my husband was still in medical school more than forty years ago, we thought we had been married a fairly long time. Now, as we look back, our entire married life doesn't really seem very long at all. Given the time limitations of our devotional today, we will mention just a few experiences that we have had together when the hand of the Lord played a prominent role in our lives. Again, we did not necessarily think about how this was happening at the time, but, in retrospect, what transpired clearly was not just by chance or coincidence. Likewise, we want to emphasize that customized, special blessings that have come to us are not predictive of what might or will happen with you. Similarly, you will have individualized blessings and interventions that have not been afforded to us or to other people. While Jesus Christ has promised that those who are faithful, keep the commandments, and make and observe their sacred covenants will receive all that the "Father hath" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38), the timing is unique for each person and does not always happen in this life.<br><br><b>COS:</b>You might begin by telling our special friends just how we got together. Since I was away on my mission at the beginning of what turned out to be an "arranged marriage," you can share a few of the details, and then I may need to tell my side of the story.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>While I was attending the University of Utah, I acquired a part-time secretarial position in the Department of Educational Psychology. I enjoyed it very much, and it was so convenient to be right on campus, since my previous job had been off campus and transportation had proven difficult. One of the professors I worked for was Dr. Cecil O. Samuelson Sr. He was very nice and pleasant, as were the other professors, but he was especially so. Eventually he mentioned to me that he had a son serving a mission and hoped that I "might be available" when he returned home. I am sure I gave an appropriate response. What I do recall thinking, however, is that dating someone your parents believe would be the perfect match for you usually ends in an embarrassing situation. Am I right? On the other hand, I felt that if his son were at all like his dad, it might be a possibility.<br><br>When his son and namesake returned from his mission, I met him when he came to the office so he and his father could drive home together. It did not take me long to change my mind, and I hoped his dad was giving him encouragement to ask me out on a date. I regret to say that it did not occur as quickly as I desired. Nevertheless, I broke off a relationship with another fellow and waited patiently. It is obvious from the fact that we are standing here together that with a little time and encouragement from his dad, we dated and eventually married--one parent-arranged marriage that was successful.<br><br><b>COS:</b>My father was a wise but also crafty man. Since I did not have my own car for a few months after my mission, I would meet my father at his office at the university to ride home with him. Somehow he always managed to have just a few more things to do, and so I was left to visit with and get to know his secretary better. We didn't date for a few months, but once we began, it didn't take long for us to know that it was a sure thing. We were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple the day before Thanksgiving in 1964 by my former mission president.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>By then I was teaching school, and we were able to get by financially. Since we both came from rather large families, we knew we wanted to have several children. However, our first wasn't born until after we had been married for more than three years. Initially we were not terribly concerned and were content to be getting farther along with my husband's medical education and saving money from my full-time teaching career.<br><br><b>COS:</b>I can still remember how excited we were when we learned we were expecting. As I recall, the pregnancy was rather uneventful--meaning I never had a single day of morning sickness!<br><br><b>SGS:</b>And I suppose you don't want me to tell anyone that you studied for your pathology final while sitting with me in labor at the hospital. I certainly wouldn't want them to know you hoped I would be as quiet as possible while experiencing a contraction.<br><br><b>COS:</b>I think I passed the medical school test, but we were over the top to be the parents of the cutest little baby boy. We enjoyed very much being new parents and had the usual challenges of that blessing most parents experience, including a night in the hospital with his severe croup. Like everyone's children, he was very precocious. He just turned forty-five last month, and we no longer describe him as cute, but he has a wonderful wife and three adorable daughters who challenge him just enough to convince his parents that there is indeed justice in the world for all the pranks, demands, and surprises he authored during his adolescence.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Still, it was my dream and my blessing to be a mother, and in that I have never felt otherwise. I think we expected to have our other children come along in due course without too much further delay, but that was not to be. Finally, after more than five years and several surgeries, our second "cutest baby boy" was born. We were again thrilled and felt blessed but didn't perceive the special circumstances that allowed for that pregnancy. We were told by our doctors that if we desired more children, we should not delay unduly because my condition could make further pregnancies unlikely over time.<br><br>We should add that our older son, now five, was disappointed, because while he had joined us in prayers for the new baby, his own prayer was for a baby brother<i>and</i>a baby sister. Now he only had the baby brother. We told him not to worry and that if there were a baby sister for him, she would eventually come. He was skeptical but seemed to be resolved.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Since obstetrics was not my field in medicine, we were perhaps naïve in our understanding about the hand of heaven in our lives at that time. Just a few months later we learned that we were in the early stages of another pregnancy, and we were very happy. Then one evening Sharon began to experience severe and acute abdominal pain. Again--although not my expertise in medicine--we knew we were in trouble, and so we went to the emergency room at the hospital where I worked. She was examined and a couple of laboratory tests were performed. The attending physician was a very good man who was experienced in such matters but who did not know my wife well. He felt the situation was not serious and that perhaps Sharon was just having an anxiety attack. Now, those who know her well know that she does get very anxious at football, basketball, soccer, and volleyball games, but this wasn't a game, and we knew our physician friend was in error.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>As we left the emergency room, I was still very uncomfortable, and we were both quite unsettled. We were praying for guidance and comfort, and it became clear that we needed a second opinion. Consequently, we headed for another hospital in our community and finally were able to reach my personal obstetrician, who had been on a Church assignment earlier when we had first decided the problem was serious.<br><br><b>COS:</b>At the second hospital we were quickly met by Sharon's doctor, who knew her well. He determined her anxiety and pain were due to an acute surgical emergency. She was rushed to the operating room and was there found to be bleeding profusely internally. The cause of the problem was an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which required immediate surgery to stop the bleeding. She had lost a great deal of blood, but her life was saved. Unfortunately, her doctor and we thought it meant that she would never be able to have another pregnancy because of this incident and the previous necessary surgery she had undergone. We did rejoice that her life was spared and that we already had two little boys in our family.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>I healed rather quickly and soon returned home to the active life of a young mother with two lively children and a husband who had a major Church calling as well as a busy professional life teaching, researching, caring for patients, and fulfilling administrative duties. We didn't really mourn but did feel rather constant disappointment that the large family we had expected and frankly took for granted was not to be.<br><br>As a young girl growing up, I had four younger brothers but no sisters. While I had girl cousins and girlfriends, I always wished for a younger sister. As I grew up, I knew that was not likely, but I looked forward to being the mother of daughters. Now that possibility seemed to have evaporated too.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Few, if any, outside of immediate family knew of this small but significant grief Sharon carried in her heart. Our boys were healthy and our life was full. About four years quickly passed, and we felt ourselves resolved and settled. We built our home with the plan that it would accommodate the four of us well, and we really were grateful for our general good fortune and happy lives. Then, one weekend in early February 1977, our lives changed.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>The married student stake in which my husband was serving as second counselor in the stake presidency was being reorganized. Elder Marvin J. Ashton of the Quorum of the Twelve was releasing the stake presidency and calling a new one. When he interviewed my husband, Elder Ashton asked if there were any difficulties or disappointments in our family life, and Cec said the only thing he could think of was the set of experiences we have just shared that seemed to determine we would always be a small family. Elder Ashton told my husband not to worry and that things "would work out the way they should." He then went on to call my husband to be the new stake president.<br><br><b>COS:</b>After the Sunday meetings and other formal activities were concluded, a member of the stake high council approached us and asked to be excused from the regular meetings for the next few days because he was returning to Guatemala, where he had served his mission, to look into the possibility of adopting a child. Without any previous discussion or consideration, at least on my part, we wished him well, excused him from his duties for the period he would be gone, and then, almost offhandedly, mentioned that perhaps this was something we should look into as well.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Within just a few days we received an unexpected call explaining that a set of twins to be born near the end of the month would be available for adoption. The birth mother, a maid with an older child, had been abandoned by the birth father, and she hoped that somehow her twins, a boy and a girl, could have a better life than what was likely for them in their Guatemalan village. We think one dimension of the concern of this pregnant Indian mother was that having twins was not considered good fortune. The practice in their area at that time was to choose the potentially strongest infant of the two and let that baby be nursed fully. The weaker baby would then be neglected because most nursing mothers did not have sufficient milk for two babies. Thus the outlook for the smaller or weaker baby was dismal.<br><br><b>COS:</b>When we mentioned that my wife had four brothers, we should have also noted that the two immediately younger than Sharon were twins and were quite a handful for her parents and also for their elder sister. Thus our immediate reaction was that we couldn't consider adopting these twins. But after a few days of careful thought and serious prayers, we had our answer that these little ones should be ours. We made the necessary arrangements and provided powdered infant formula to the wonderful people caring for the twins. Then I and our friend made our way to Guatemala to bring the babies home.<br><br>We are confident that the hand of the Lord was on those good people, because our twins were healthy when I arrived, although our daughter was still very tiny. Our eldest son's prayer for "a brother<i>and</i>a sister" was answered.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>We have told parts of this experience before at BYU and elsewhere. Suffice it to say, with a number of other miracles--some of which we did recognize as they occurred--we had our baby girl and baby boy home in Utah in just a couple of months after their birth. Next month they will be thirty-six, and each is happily married with children of their own.<br><br>Now, having doubled the number of our children almost overnight and having the little sister for our older boys, the daughter for me, and a third son for all of us, we felt our quiver was finally full. Surely we had been richly blessed, and we acknowledged our gratitude for these very happy circumstances, although we learned that this many little people, particularly twin infants, was not necessarily a picnic much of the time.<br><br><b>COS:</b>I should confess that during all this time when I would sit on the stand in Church, it was left to Sharon to struggle with the kids. When asked by a well-meaning member of our ward whether or not I ever helped with the children in Church, my wife would answer, "Oh, yes! Whenever they misbehave, he scowls at them from the stand." But there is yet another interesting--at least to us--part of our story. Another four years passed, and then my dear wife returned from a doctor's appointment to announce that she was pregnant. What a surprise! My older sister Carol has always described our fifth child, Sara, as the "miracle child" because her birth occurred against very long medical odds.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Now no one can ever say that my husband has not given a medical devotional! We share these experiences only to show the hand of the Lord in our lives and to remind ourselves and others that seeming disappointments and disasters are often the keys that open the doors to greater blessings and opportunities than might have ever been hoped for or even conceived.<br><br>For those of you wondering why similar blessings are not now yours, we can only remind you of Jesus' promises and blessings that will yet be yours but that are not possible without significant trials and disappointments beforehand.<br><br><b>COS:</b>The scriptures are replete with accounts of the hand of the Lord influencing the lives of the Father's children. You will have your favorites, and we have ours. A useful exercise that we recommend is to go through the scriptures and count the many references to the reality of the Lord's hand in the lives of His people. The promise made by the Lord to Abraham is one promise He makes to all of us: "Behold, I will lead thee by my hand" (Abraham 1:18).<br><br>Before we close, we must mention one other very significant and major event in our lives that has been lifting and even transforming for us. It also involves "children"--and lots of them! But unlike those we have mentioned, we are not formally sealed to them like we are to the five who have grown up in our home.<br><br>We speak of the great privilege of our assignment to BYU. Because we are now getting just a little bit older, we hope we can be excused for considering all of the students who have been at BYU during our tenure or are currently here to be "our children." Now, we know you are all grown-ups, but we do feel the pride and pain of parenthood as we see you grow, struggle, achieve, and excel. While not officially codified in the BYU Aims and Mission Statement, you and the thousands like you are great blessings in our lives. We feel the same about our colleagues in the administration and in various staff assignments and of course your teachers and faculty members.<br><br><b>SGS:</b>Candidly, coming to BYU, especially in our current positions, was never part of any of our plans or even wildest considerations. I must confess that when my husband told me of this assignment after he was invited to President Hinckley's office, I thought he was kidding. And then, when I saw he was serious, I thought President Hinckley must have been kidding! Now, after a few years, we seriously wonder what we might have done that brought us to enjoy the good fortune of experiencing all that is BYU. We do know that the hand of the Lord is on this very special university. We know that God lives and loves us and will guide, correct, and direct us if we are willing to have Him do so.<br><br><b>COS:</b>Perhaps I will save for another occasion a litany of sacred experiences I could share that confirms deeply in my heart and mind the truthfulness of what Sister Samuelson has said about the involvement of heaven in the work of BYU. I am a witness and know that this is true and occurs with great regularity. BYU is a very important part of the great cause of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are led by prophet leaders and are greatly blessed to serve under the direction of President Thomas S. Monson, whom we love and sustain. Please know of our faith in you, our faith in BYU, and especially our faith in the tender hand of the Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>Truth? - Dieter F. Uchtdorf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, my dear young friends, I am grateful for the privilege to be with you today. It always lifts my spirits to be surrounded by the young adults of the Church, and you inspire me to declare, "Let Zion in her beauty rise." As you are living all around the world, you represent in a beautiful way the future and strength of the Church. Because of your righteous desires and your commitment to follow the Savior, the future of this Church looks bright.<br><br>I bring you the love and blessing of President Thomas S. Monson. The First Presidency prays for you often. We always ask the Lord to bless, keep, and guide you.<br><h2><strong>The Blind Men and the Elephant</strong></h2><br>Well over one hundred years ago, an American poet put to rhyme an ancient parable. The first verse of the poem speaks about<br><br><i>six men of Indostan</i><br><i>To learning much inclined,</i><br><i>Who went to see the Elephant</i><br><i>(Though all of them were blind),</i><br><i>That each by observation</i><br><i>Might satisfy his mind.</i><br><br>In the poem each of the six travelers takes hold of a different part of the elephant and then describes to the others what he has discovered.<br><br>One of the men finds the elephant's leg and describes it as being round and rough like a tree. Another feels the tusk and describes the elephant as a spear. A third grabs the tail and insists that an elephant is like a rope. A fourth discovers the trunk and insists that the elephant is like a large snake.<br><br>Each is describing truth.<br><br>And because his truth comes from personal experience, each insists that he knows what he knows.<br><br>The poem concludes:<br><br><i>And so these men of Indostan</i><br><i>Disputed loud and long,</i><br><i>Each in his own opinion</i><br><i>Exceeding stiff and strong,</i><br><i>Though each was partly in the right,</i><br><i>And all were in the wrong</i>!<sup>1</sup><br><br>We look at this story from a distance and smile. After all, we know what an elephant looks like. We have read about them and watched them on film, and many of us have even seen one with our own eyes. We believe we know the truth of what an elephant is. That someone could make a judgment based on one aspect of truth and apply it to the whole seems absurd or even unbelievable. On the other hand, can't we recognize ourselves in these six blind men? Have we ever been guilty of the same pattern of thought?<br><br>I suppose the reason this story has remained so popular in so many cultures and over so many years is because of its universal application. The Apostle Paul said that in this world the light is dim and we see only part of the truth as though we are looking "through a glass, darkly."<sup>2</sup>And yet it seems to be part of our nature as human beings to make assumptions about people, politics, and piety based on our incomplete and often misleading experience.<br><br>I am reminded of a story about a couple who had been married for sixty years. They had rarely argued during that time, and their days together passed in happiness and contentment. They shared everything and had no secrets between them--except one. The wife had a box that she kept at the top of a sideboard, and she told her husband when they were married that he should never look inside.<br><br>As the decades passed, the moment came that her husband took the box down and asked if he could finally know what it contained. The wife consented, and he opened it to discover two doilies and $25,000. When he asked his wife what this meant, she responded, "When we were married, my mother told me that whenever I was angry with you or whenever you said or did something I didn't like, I should knit a small doily and then talk things through with you."<br><br>The husband was moved to tears by this sweet story. He marveled that during sixty years of marriage he had only disturbed his wife enough for her to knit two doilies. Feeling extremely good about himself, he took his wife's hand and said, "That explains the doilies, but what about the $25,000?"<br><br>His wife smiled sweetly and said, "That's the money I got from selling all the doilies I've knitted over the years."<br><br>Not only does this story teach an interesting way to deal with disagreements in marriage, but it also illustrates the folly of jumping to conclusions based on limited information.<br><br>So often the "truths" we tell ourselves are merely fragments of the truth, and sometimes they're not really the truth at all.<br><br>Today I would like to speak of truth. As I do, I invite you to ponder a few important questions.<br><br>The first question is "What is truth?"<br><br>The second, "Is it really possible to know the truth?"<br><br>And third, "How should we react to things that contradict truths which we have learned previously?"<br><h2><strong>What Is Truth?</strong></h2><br>What is truth? During the closing hours of His life, the Savior was brought before Pontius Pilate. The elders of the Jews had accused Jesus of sedition and treason against Rome and insisted that He be put to death.<br><br>When Pilate came face to face with the Man of Galilee, he asked, "Are you a king?"<br><br>Jesus replied, "For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."<sup>3</sup><br><br>I don't know what kind of man Pilate was, nor do I know what he was thinking. However, I suspect that he was well educated and had seen much of the known world.<br><br>I sense a certain weary cynicism in Pilate's reply. I hear in his words the voice of a man who may once have been an idealist but now--after a great deal of life experience--seems a little hardened, even tired.<br><br>I don't believe Pilate was encouraging a dialogue when he responded with three simple words: "What is truth?"<sup>4</sup><br><br>To amplify, I wonder if what he really was asking was "How can anyone possibly know the truth?"<br><br>And that is a question for all time and for all people.<br><h2><strong>Can Anyone Know the Truth?</strong></h2><br>Now, can anyone know the truth? Some of the greatest minds that have ever lived on this earth have attempted to answer that question. The elusive nature of truth has been a favorite theme of history's great poets and storytellers. Shakespeare seemed especially intrigued with it. The next time you read one of Shakespeare's tragedies, notice how often the plot turns on a misunderstanding of an important truth.<br><br>Now, never in the history of the world have we had easier access to more information--some of it true, some of it false, and much of it partially true.<br><br>Consequently, never in the history of the world has it been more important to learn how to correctly discern between truth and error.<br><br>Part of our problem in the quest for truth is that human wisdom has disappointed us so often. We have so many examples of things that mankind once "knew" were true but have since been proven false.<br><br>For example, in spite of one-time over­whelming consensus, the earth isn't flat. The stars don't revolve around the earth. Eating a tomato will not cause instant death. And, of course, man actually can fly--even break the sound barrier.<br><br>The scriptures are filled with stories of men and women who misinterpreted "truth."<br><br>In the Old Testament, Balaam could not resist "the wages of unrighteousness"<sup>5</sup>offered him by the Moabites. So he convinced himself to believe a new truth and helped the Moabites get the Israelites to curse themselves through immorality and disobedience.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The apostate Korihor, after leading many away from the truth, confessed that the devil had deceived him to the point where he actually believed that what he was saying was the truth.<sup>7</sup><br><br>In the Book of Mormon, both the Nephites as well as the Lamanites created their own "truths" about each other. The Nephites' "truth" about the Lamanites was that they "were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people,"<sup>8</sup>never able to accept the gospel. The Lamanites' "truth" about the Nephites was that Nephi had stolen his brother's birthright and that Nephi's descendants were liars who continued to rob the Lamanites of what was rightfully theirs.<sup>9</sup>These "truths" fed their hatred for one another until it finally ­consumed them all.<br><br>Needless to say, there are many examples in the Book of Mormon that contradict both of these stereotypes. Nevertheless, the Nephites and Lamanites believed these "truths" that shaped the destiny of this once-mighty and beautiful people.<br><h2><strong>Human Nature and Truth</strong></h2><br>In some way we are all susceptible to such strange thinking.<br><br>The "truths" we cling to shape the quality of our societies as well as our individual characters. All too often these "truths" are based on incomplete and inaccurate evidence, and at times they serve very selfish motives.<br><br>Part of the reason for poor judgment comes from the tendency of mankind to blur the line between belief and truth. We too often confuse belief with truth, thinking that because something makes sense or is convenient, it must be true. Conversely, we sometimes don't believe truth or reject it--because it would require us to change or admit that we were wrong. Often, truth is rejected because it doesn't appear to be consistent with previous experiences.<br><br>When the opinions or "truths" of others contradict our own, instead of considering the possibility that there could be information that might be helpful and augment or complement what we know, we often jump to conclusions or make assumptions that the other person is misinformed, mentally challenged, or even intentionally trying to deceive.<br><br>Unfortunately, this tendency can spread to all areas of our lives--from sports to family relationships and from religion to politics.<br><h2><b>Ignaz Semmelweis</b></h2><br>A tragic example of this tendency is the story of Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who practiced medicine during the mid-nineteenth century. Early in his career, Dr. Semmelweis learned that 10 percent of the women who came to his clinic died of childbed fever, while the death rate at a nearby clinic was less than 4 percent. He was determined to find out why.<br><br>After investigating the two clinics, Dr. Semmelweis concluded that the only significant difference was that his was a teaching clinic where corpses were examined. He observed doctors who went directly from performing autopsies to delivering babies. He concluded that somehow the corpses had contaminated their hands and caused the deadly fevers.<br><br>When he began to recommend that doctors scrub their hands with a chlorinated lime solution, he was met with indifference and even scorn. His conclusions contradicted the "truths" of other doctors. Some of his colleagues even believed that it was absurd to think that a doctor's hand could be impure or cause sickness.<br><br>But Semmelweis insisted, and he made it a policy for doctors in his clinic to wash their hands before delivering babies. As a consequence, the death rate promptly dropped by 90 percent. Semmelweis felt vindicated and was certain that this practice would now be adopted throughout the medical community. But he was wrong. Even his dramatic results were not enough to change the minds of many doctors of the day.<br><h2><strong>Is It Possible to Know the Truth?</strong></h2><br>The thing about truth is that it exists beyond belief. It is true even if nobody believes it.<br><br>We can say west is north and north is west all day long and even believe it with all our heart, but if, for example, we want to fly from Quito, Ecuador, to New York City in the United States, there is only one direction that will lead us there, and that is north--west just won't do.<br><br>Of course, this is just a simple aviation analogy. However, there is indeed such a thing as absolute truth--unassailable, unchangeable truth.<br><br>This truth is different from belief. It is different from hope. Absolute truth is not dependent upon public opinion or popularity. Polls cannot sway it. Not even the inexhaustible authority of celebrity endorsement can change it.<br><br>So how can we find truth?<br><br>I believe that our Father in Heaven is pleased with His children when they use their talents and mental faculties to earnestly discover truth. Over the centuries many wise men and women--through logic, reason, scientific inquiry, and, yes, through inspiration--have discovered truth. These discoveries have enriched mankind, improved our lives, and inspired joy, wonder, and awe.<br><br>Even so, the things we once thought we knew are continually being enhanced, modified, or even contradicted by enterprising scholars who seek to understand truth.<br><br>As we all know, it is difficult enough to sort out the truth from our own experiences. To make matters worse, we have an adversary, "the devil, [who] as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Satan is the great deceiver, "the accuser of [the] brethren,"<sup>11</sup>the father of all lies,<sup>12</sup>who continually seeks to deceive that he might overthrow us.<sup>13</sup><br><br>The adversary has many cunning strategies for keeping mortals from the truth. He offers the belief that truth is relative; appealing to our sense of tolerance and fairness, he keeps the real truth hidden by claiming that one person's "truth" is as valid as any other.<br><br>Some he entices to believe that there is an absolute truth out there somewhere but that it is impossible for anyone to know it.<br><br>For those who already embrace the truth, his primary strategy is to spread the seeds of doubt. For example, he has caused many members of the Church to stumble when they discover information about the Church that seems to contradict what they had learned previously.<br><br>If you experience such a moment, remember that in this age of information there are many who create doubt about anything and everything, at any time and every place.<br><br>You will find even those who still claim that they have evidence that the earth is flat, that the moon is a hologram, and that certain movie stars are really aliens from another planet. And it is always good to keep in mind that just because something is printed on paper, appears on the Internet, is frequently repeated, or has a powerful group of followers doesn't make it true.<br><br>Sometimes untrue claims or information are presented in such a way that they appear quite credible. However, when you are confronted with information that is in conflict with the revealed word of God, remember that the blind men in the parable of the elephant would never be able to accurately describe the full truth.<br><br>We simply don't know all things--we can't see everything. What may seem contradictory now may be perfectly understandable as we search for and receive more trustworthy information. Because we see through a glass darkly, we have to trust the Lord, who sees all things clearly.<br><br>Yes, our world is full of confusion. But eventually all of our questions will be answered. All of our doubts will be replaced by certainty. And that is because there is one source of truth that is complete, correct, and incorruptible. That source is our infinitely wise and all-knowing Heavenly Father. He knows truth as it was, as it is, and as it yet will be.<sup>14</sup>"He comprehendeth all things, . . . and he is above all things, . . . and all things are by him, and of him."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Our loving Heavenly Father offers His truth to us, His mortal children.<br><br>Now, what is this truth?<br><br>It is His gospel. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life."<sup>16</sup><br><br>If we will only have enough courage and faith to walk in His path, it will lead us to peace of heart and mind, to lasting meaning in life, to happiness in this world, and to joy in the world to come. The Savior is "not far from every one of us."<sup>17</sup>We have His promise that if we seek Him diligently, we will find Him.<sup>18</sup><br><h2><strong>Our Obligation to Seek for Truth</strong></h2><br>But how can we know that this "truth" is different from any other? How can we trust this "truth"?<br><br>The invitation to trust the Lord does not relieve us from the responsibility to know for ourselves. This is more than an opportunity; it is an obligation--and it is one of the reasons we were sent to this earth.<br><br>Latter-day Saints are not asked to blindly accept everything they hear. We are encouraged to think and discover truth for ourselves. We are expected to ponder, to search, to evaluate, and thereby to come to a personal knowledge of the truth.<br><br>Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>I am . . . afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him. I am fearful they settle down in a state of blind self-security. . . . Let every man and woman know, by the whispering of the Spirit of God to themselves, whether their leaders are walking in the path the Lord dictates.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>We seek for truth wherever we may find it. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that<br><br>Mormonism is truth. . . . The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is, that we believe that we have a right to embrace all, and every item of truth, without limitation or . . . being . . . prohibited by the creeds or superstitious notions of men.<sup>20</sup><br><br>Yes, we do have the fulness of the everlasting gospel, but that does not mean that we know everything. In fact, one principle of the restored gospel is our belief that God "will yet reveal many great and important things."<sup>21</sup><br><br>The Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ came about because of a young man with a humble heart and a keen mind seeking for truth. Joseph studied and then acted accordingly. He discovered that if a man lacks wisdom, he can ask of God and the truth really will be given unto him.<sup>22</sup><br><br>The great miracle of the Restoration was not just that it corrected false ideas and corrupt doctrines--though it certainly did that--but that it flung open the curtains of heaven and initiated a steady downpour of new light and knowledge that has continued to this day.<br><br>So we continually seek truth from all good books and other wholesome sources. "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."<sup>23</sup>In this manner we can resist the deceit of the evil one. In this manner we learn the truth "precept upon precept; line upon line."<sup>24</sup>And we will learn that intelligence cleaves unto intelligence, and wisdom receives wisdom, and truth embraces truth.<sup>25</sup><br><br>My young friends, as you accept the responsibility to seek after truth with an open mind and a humble heart, you will become more tolerant of others, more open to listen, more prepared to understand, more inclined to build up instead of tearing down, and more willing to go where the Lord wants you to go.<br><h2><strong>The Holy Ghost--Our Guide to All Truth</strong></h2><br>Just think about it. You actually have a powerful companion and trustworthy guide in this ongoing search for truth. Who is it? It is the Holy Ghost. Our Heavenly Father knew how difficult it would be for us to sift through all the competing noise and discover truth during our mortality. He knew we would see only a portion of the truth, and He knew that Satan would try to deceive us. So He gave us the heavenly gift of the Holy Ghost to illuminate our minds, teach us, and testify to us of the truth.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is a revelator. He is the Comforter, who teaches us "the truth of all things; [who] knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment."<sup>26</sup><br><br>The Holy Ghost is a certain and safe guide to assist all mortals who seek God as they navigate the often troubling waters of confusion and contradiction.<br><br>The<i>Witness</i>of truth from the Holy Ghost is available to all, everywhere, all around the globe. All who seek to know the truth, who study it out in their minds,<sup>27</sup>and who "ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, [will know] the truth . . . by the power of the Holy Ghost."<sup>28</sup><br><br>And there is the additional, unspeakable<i>Gift</i>of the Holy Ghost available to all who qualify themselves through baptism and by living worthy of His constant companionship.<br><br>Yes, your loving Father in Heaven would never leave you alone in this mortality to wander in the dark. You need not be deceived. You can overcome the darkness of this world and discover divine truth.<br><br>Some, however, do not seek for truth so much as they strive for contention. They do not sincerely seek to learn; rather, they desire to dispute, to show off their supposed learning and thus cause contention. They ignore or reject the counsel of the Apostle Paul to Timothy: "Foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do [generate contention]."<sup>29</sup><br><br>As disciples of Jesus Christ, we know that such contention is completely inconsistent with the Spirit upon whom we depend in our search for truth. As the Savior warned the Nephites, "For verily . . . I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention."<sup>30</sup><br><br>If you follow the Spirit, your personal search for the truth inevitably leads you to the Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, for He is "the way, the truth, and the life."<sup>31</sup>This may not be the most convenient way; it will probably also be the road less traveled, and it will be the path with mountains to climb, swift rivers to cross, but it will be His way--the Savior's redeeming way.<br><br>I add my witness as an Apostle of the Lord, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I know this with all my heart and mind. I know this by the witness and power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I ask you to spare no efforts in your search to know this truth for yourself--because this truth will make you free.<sup>32</sup><br><br>My dear young friends, you are the hope of Israel. We love you. The Lord knows you; He loves you. The Lord has great confidence in you. He knows your successes, and He is mindful of your challenges and questions in life.<br><br>It is my prayer that you will seek the truth earnestly and unceasingly, that you will yearn to drink from the fount of all truth, whose waters are pure and sweet, "a well of water springing up into everlasting life."<sup>33</sup><br><br>I bless you with confidence in the Lord and a deep-rooted desire to rightfully discern truth from error--now and throughout your life. This is my prayer and my blessing, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dieter F.

<h1>c Priorities and Dedicated Disciples - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I  wish to begin today by expressing to you my witness that God is our Eternal Father, that He lives, that we are His children, and that He loves us. His great love was manifest when He sent His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to the earth to atone for our sins and to teach and exemplify for each of us the things we should do in order to qualify and be worthy to return back into God's presence. I bear you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is our Savior and He is our Redeemer. He lives and He loves us and He knows each of us individually by our names. I love Him, and I know each of you do too. I also wish to bear my testimony that President Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet on the earth today. I know this through my personal experience in incorporating his counsel into my life and also because of the powerful witness that comes into my heart from the Holy Ghost each time I am in his presence or hear him speak. Today I express my commitment to him and my resolve and desire to assist him in his heavy responsibilities. I desire to serve as he does, with all my heart, might, mind, and strength.<br><br>Today we stand at the beginning of a brand-new year--part of an epic journey here in mortality. As we approach this clean, fresh page of our lives, unmarred and unspoiled, we have before us a new opportunity to rally the best within us. Everything that has gone before has prepared you for this moment in time. And I might hasten to testify to you that this is indeed a magnificent moment. It is yours. And set before you is the opportunity of a lifetime to become a force for good in the world. As a modern-day prophet of God foretold, "Make no mistake about it--this is a marked generation." He further said:<br><br><i>There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short period of time than there is of us. ...</i><br><br><i>Each day the forces of evil and the forces of good enlist new recruits. Each day we personally make many decisions showing the cause we support. The final outcome is certain--the forces of righteousness will win. But what remains to be seen is<b>where</b>each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this battle--and<b>how tall</b>we will stand. Will we be true to our last days and fulfill our foreordained missions?</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>When the gospel was restored to the earth through the instrumentality of a young teenage boy named Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery recorded these words: "These were days never to be forgotten."<sup>2</sup>He then went on to describe--in some of the most beautiful language I have ever read--his experiences with the Prophet Joseph Smith as they translated the sacred records that are the Book of Mormon. I feel a deep sense of gratitude today for those young men--for their faithfulness, for their obedience and commitment, and for the purity of their lives. They were exceptional! And because they went forward undaunted to do what the Lord had revealed and commanded them to do in answer to their sincere prayers and questions, today we have another testament of Jesus Christ: the Book of Mormon--a true and precious record that was written for me and for you to help us become the leaders we have been reserved and prepared to become in these latter days. These are your days, and I am confident that you will also make them "days never to be forgotten."<br><br>To those who listen carefully, the Lord regularly prompts us to act. Never before has there been more opportunity than now. I believe the Lord is calling to each of us to become dedicated disciples. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said that in order to become a dedicated disciple, "it is not enough merely to speak of Jesus Christ or proclaim that we are His disciples. It is not enough to surround ourselves with symbols of our religion. Discipleship is not a spectator sport."<sup>3</sup><br><br>The movie<i>Chariots of Fire</i>is the moving story of Eric Liddell, the gold medal winner in the 400-meter track event in the 1924 Paris Olympics. Liddell was not only a gifted athlete who held to his convictions, but he lived out his faith to the very end as a Christian missionary in China. He was such an incredible athlete that his goal was to get to the 1924 Olympics in France and run in his best race--the 100-meter race. He trained hard to get in top shape, and his country of Scotland was sure that he would win a gold medal for them. There was just one problem. The heat to decide who would make the Olympics was on a Sunday, and Liddell would not run on Sunday. Due to this conflict he chose not to run in the 100-meter race. Instead he qualified for the 200- and 400-meter races because those heats were not held on Sunday, but no one expected him to come close to winning. Just prior to the start of the 400-meter race, he was given a piece of paper on which was written words from 1 Samuel 2:30: "Them that honour me, I will honour." Liddell ran with that piece of paper in his hand and held onto this promise tightly. And, to everyone's surprise, he won the gold medal and broke a world record.<sup>4</sup>Listen to what his character in the film<i>Chariots of Fire</i>said after winning a previous race:<br><br><i>You came to see a race today. To see someone win. It happened to be me. But I want you to do more than just watch a race. I want you to take part in it. I want to compare faith to running in a race. It's hard. It requires concentration of will, energy of soul. You experience elation when the winner breaks the tape--especially if you've got a bet on it. But how long does that last? You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt. Maybe you haven't got a job. So who am I to say, "Believe, have faith," in the face of life's realities? I would like to give you something more permanent, but I can only point the way. I have no formula for winning the race. Everyone runs in her own way, or his own way. And where does the power come from to see the race to its end? From within.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>We must do more than just watch the race: we must take part in it. Believe! Have faith! Discipleship is not a spectator sport. "And where does the power come from to see the race to its end? From within." I think the Lord is saying, "Let's move forward. Let's build the kingdom. Hasten my work." Those who have been prepared and reserved for this moment in time are here on the earth. You are here! The Lord knows what lies ahead, and this is just the beginning of your life's race and the many mighty miracles that will occur as He hastens His work! The Lord has said, "I will hasten my work in its time."<sup>6</sup>And now is the time! To hasten means to be quick to do something, to move forward quickly, to accelerate, to hurry and not delay. Several years ago President Boyd K. Packer said, "My young friends in the Church, I bear witness that this is the day of hastening, and as I speak to you about opportunity and obligation, I stress the word 'obligation.'"<sup>7</sup><br><br>In the Pearl of Great Price we have a record of Abraham written by his own hand. He described the decadent society in which he was living and his difficulty in standing alone, because even his parents had departed from the ways of the Lord. He recorded that it got so bad that it was necessary for him to flee his home because his father had offered him up to the priest as a human sacrifice to their gods. He recorded:<br><br><i>And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The desire of his heart was to be a follower of righteousness--which is, simply, a disciple. And the Lord, through His prophet, is calling you to determine to be an even "greater follower of righteousness." A disciple of Christ is a follower of Jesus who lives as He taught and exemplified. As we learn in Doctrine and Covenants 41:5, "He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple."<br><br>Thus, as dedicated disciples we must act and make prophetic priorities our priorities. In order to do this we will need to be riveted on the words of the current prophets, seers, and revelators. Some of those prophetic priorities include (1) missionary work, (2) teaching and learning for youth, and (3) temple and family history work.<br><h2><b>Missionary Work</b></h2><br>A few months ago we listened in general conference as President Thomas S. Monson announced the lowering of the age at which both young men and young women may serve missions. From my perspective on the stand in the LDS Conference Center, I watched as young men gasped, young women raised from their seats and started texting their bishops, and mothers started crying--already missing their sons and daughters. Since then, the response has been overwhelming as both young men and young women have responded to the feelings in their hearts and started their preparations to serve missions. I loved the tweets, the chatter on the Internet, and the pictures you posted about what this would mean in your personal lives.<br><br>Now, if missionary work is one of the prophetic priorities, shouldn't it be one of our priorities in the coming year? Many here today are contemplating serving a mission. Many of you have already served missions. For the young men, this is a priesthood responsibility for which you should be and are preparing. For young women, this is a wonderful opportunity, but not an obligation. But do we need a formal call to serve a mission? After you return from your mission, has your identity as one of the Lord's missionaries changed? Can we, as dedicated disciples, follow a prophet of God and help to hasten the Lord's work by continuing to do our part to flood the earth with righteousness?<br><br>Clayton M. Christensen, a Harvard business professor and well-known expert on innovation and growth, decided to call himself on a mission and to simply become an "everyday missionary"<sup>9</sup>by talking about the things he believes and about the gospel to anyone with whom he comes in contact and with anyone who will listen. He is not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He is a dedicated disciple. As we follow a prophet of God, could each of us determine to become an everyday missionary?<br><h2><b>Teaching and Learning for Youth</b></h2><br>Prior to the last general conference, a First Presidency letter was sent to priesthood leaders announcing new teaching and learning resources for youth to be implemented starting this month. The focus of this new resource is to build faith, testimony, and conversion in the Savior. This will hasten personal spiritual progress. This new way of learning will give all who participate an added edge because they will know how to learn by study and also by faith. What you and I will observe in the coming days will be a wave of articulate advocates of the gospel of Jesus Christ--filled with the Spirit and deeply converted--going forth into all the world. This new way to learn will prepare youth for missionary work, for marriage, and for parenthood. This is not just for youth but for<i>you!</i>Get on lds.org and become familiar with and practice these same principles. Apply the doctrine in your daily decisions and work to become a dedicated disciple of our Savior.<br><h2><b>Temple and Family History Work</b></h2><br>Another prophetic priority was announced by the First Presidency in a letter dated October 8, 2012, that encouraged youth and adults to do their own family history work and to take their own family names to the temple. You may recall in the October 2011 general conference, prior to this letter, that Elder David A. Bednar invited the youth (including each of you) to become engaged in family history and temple work for their own ancestors.<sup>10</sup>Following that invitation, Elder Richard G. Scott urged again for each of us to be worthy to enter the temples and do the work of turning "the hearts of the children to the fathers." 11<br><br>Also, one year ago a revised<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>booklet was issued to help not just youth but you--all of us--understand the standards of the gospel. Living these standards enables each of us to be worthy to enter the temple and to do this work. A new limited-use recommend has also been made available, making it possible for anyone who is worthy to go to the temple and do baptisms for the dead. The hand of the Lord has brought all these things together in a most miraculous way.<br><br>It is so vitally important that each of us determine now to make the necessary adjustments and changes in our lives to be worthy always of a temple recommend. As you take your own family names to the temple, the Lord will amplify your ability to learn and to focus on the things that matter most. You will come forth from the temple armed with power, and His "angels [will be] round about you, to bear you up."<sup>12</sup>Always with prophetic priorities come prophetic promises. Elder Bednar promised to those who would seek out their ancestors and do their work that "your testimony of and conversion to the Savior will become deep and abiding. ... You will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary [and,] as you participate in and love this holy work, you will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives."<sup>13</sup>What would happen if each of us simply got on the Internet and found a few family names to take to the temple?<br><br>During the past several years I have been on the front row, so to speak, as I have watched these things unfold and come together. I have been an eyewitness to the arm of the Lord being revealed. None of these things has randomly happened. His hand is in this work, and He is hastening our preparation if we will listen and act. I testify that we are led by a prophet of God and that the Lord is inspiring every announcement, every letter, and every talk. It is an amazing time. And it is a time when we, like Abraham, must determine to act and not be acted upon.<br><br>These events make it clear that the Lord is indeed hastening His work, and they send a very powerful message that God loves and trusts you, the rising generation. President Monson said, when speaking of you, "I think the youth today are stronger than they have ever been before in the history of the Church."<sup>14</sup>I agree. You are amazing! You are not ordinary, and these are not ordinary times in which we live. You have been reserved and prepared to be on the earth at this time, and though the circumstances in which we live present many challenges, you can do it! You are, as the Savior stated, "children of the prophets ... and ... of the covenant."<sup>15</sup>You are of the noble birthright of our Father Abraham. You are exceptional, and you are doing difficult but correct things in the midst of great opposition. Your actions and decisions now will bless future generations. Indeed, you are a pivotal generation.<br><h2><b>Counsel for Dedicated Disciples</b></h2><br>As you witness these prophetic priorities unfolding and as you participate in many of them, I would like to give you some counsel similar to the counsel Paul gave to his young friend Timothy. Paul said, "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<sup>16</sup><br><br>First, don't let anyone tell you that you are too young. Paul told Timothy, "Let no man despise thy youth." Many times you will hear, "Well, come back when you have a little more experience." Or, "Wait to decide that until you are a little older." Or, "Delay marriage until you have a little more financial security and schooling." But buying into that worldly philosophy denies the knowledge you already have that you are not ordinary and that you have come here to go forward with faith and with the power of your youth and your unique perspective. Don't let old paradigms become your parameters.<br><br>I am personally keenly aware that many of the blessings I am enjoying now in this life stem from decisions I made when I was between the ages of eighteen and thirty. This amazing man sitting with me here on the stand happens to be the best decision I made while here at BYU. To this day he still thinks he saw me first, but the fact is that I spotted him on campus, went to the administration building, found out his schedule, and just happened to be near some of his classes occasionally. I believe you might call that "stalking" today! But I called it flirting then. And I clearly remember sitting in a devotional similar to this having prayed about making the decision to marry or not marry this man. I was worried. I felt so young. That day the speaker spoke about how to make decisions. I can still vividly recall feeling that I was the only one in the entire devotional that morning, and I left with the formula for how to receive personal revelation--to know all things that I should or should not do. That formula is one that all of you are familiar with in sections 8 and 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants--but that day it was news to me. And, as you can see, I applied the formula, and the rest is history!<br><br>I don't think either Steve or I realized or visualized what the future would hold then. We felt so young. We were so young! This Christmas I gave my husband a family portrait. As he opened it, it was one of those magic moments when heaven and earth come together. We looked at our eternal family and we sat in the living room and cried as we counted our blessings and as we thought about all those critical decisions along the path of life--made when we were young, following the guidance of the Spirit. So I invite you to read Doctrine and Covenants sections 8 and 9, learn the pattern, follow the Spirit, and don't let anyone tell you that you are too young. "Let no man despise thy youth."<br><br>The Lord loves and trusts the youth. He always has. He gave Joseph Smith the responsibility to open this dispensation, to translate the Book of Mormon, to hold the keys of the priesthood and the sealing power, and to receive prophetic witness and guidance. He was just fourteen. Through a prophet of God the Lord called Mormon when he was just ten to continue in his habit of being quick to observe and to prepare to keep the record when the time came. That record guides you and me today: the Book of Mormon. To Mary and Joseph, God entrusted His Only Begotten Son to be raised in virtue and holiness. They were young. Moroni led an army to defend family, religion, and God when he was about your age. And to Samuel was entrusted a kingdom because the Lord looked on his heart, not on his age. To 2,060 young men was given the responsibility to defend their parents' covenants. And the list goes on and on and on. So don't let anyone or anything convince you that you are too young. You must seize the day because these are your days, and if the adversary can get you to postpone or delay your progress or to freeze you in fear or to get you to wait because he has convinced you that you are too young, he wins. Your youth is your strategic advantage.<br><br>Second, "neglect not the gift that is in thee."<sup>17</sup>The gift that you received at baptism is one of your greatest assets. When hands were laid on your head and you were told to "receive the Holy Ghost," it was not a passive pronouncement. Rather, those words implied that you would do all in your power to be worthy of that constant companionship. The guidance of the Holy Ghost is critical to you for your successful mission here on the earth. Is it any wonder then that the great deceiver has manipulated media, the Internet, pop stars, women's fashion--anything he can--to cause you to neglect "the gift that is in thee." We must value virtue, which is defined as chastity and moral purity.<sup>18</sup>Virtue is solidified as we form patterns of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. We have all been eyewitnesses to the consequences of a disregard for virtue in our society and in families. You have heard me talk about it before, but virtue is absolutely necessary because, as Mormon taught Moroni, it is "most dear and precious above all."<sup>19</sup>Why? Because the Holy Ghost simply does not dwell in "unholy temples"<sup>20</sup>--"which temple ye are."<sup>21</sup><br><br>We must qualify to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. This is difficult in a very noisy and polluted world, so that is precisely why the Lord gave us the sacrament so that we could each partake of the sacrament and become unspotted from the world. What blessings are available to us and what power we may have to be able to renew our covenants on a weekly basis and receive the promise that we will "always have his Spirit to be with [us]!"<sup>22</sup>Because you are members of the Church, you have an edge in the world--an added advantage that puts you ahead of the crowd. You have the right to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, and the roles of this third member of the Godhead are to teach, testify, warn, comfort, lead, guide, and purify, to name a few. Elder Bruce R. McConkie once said, "There is no price too high, ... no struggle too severe, no sacrifice too great, if out of it all we receive and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost."<sup>23</sup><br><br>I am sure when we learned that we would be able to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost while here in mortality, we shouted for joy and confidently embraced our Father's plan because we knew that we would never be alone and that knowing what is right and wrong would be and is always possible. And we also knew that through the guidance of the Holy Ghost we would be magnified and, because of the Savior and His infinite Atonement, we could do hard things. We knew we would be enabled and strengthened to do whatever we must do and to endure whatever we must endure to be victorious in fulfilling our divine missions. I believe we knew and understood perfectly that mortality would not be easy, but, if we proved faithful, we would be able to return once again to our heavenly home proven, pure, and sealed in eternal families.<br><br>Third, as the words of the hymn suggest, be "more fit for the kingdom."<sup>24</sup>I heard about one young man who set a New Year's goal to do one push-up on January 1st and then each day add one more push-up to his fitness routine. He envisioned that at the end of the year he would pound his chest and with his buff body and his strong arms complete his goal by doing 365 push-ups. He lasted until January 12th. So, set little, attainable goals. Establish and rely on the power of habit. Your spiritual fitness routine will look different than mine. But make it a routine.<br><br>My husband has a routine he does every single morning. First, he prays. Then it is off to the stationary bike, the elliptical trainer, and then the treadmill. I call him a "greenhouse runner" because he does all this inside. Nonetheless, on the bike he reads from the Book of Mormon, on the elliptical he studies a conference talk, and on the treadmill he memorizes things like scriptures, the family proclamation, "The Living Christ," and even the Young Women theme! I am in awe at his discipline--he doesn't have to decide daily what to do. He is relying on the power of habit. And those habits have ripple effects in the rest of his life and in the lives of our entire family. He is a disciplined, dedicated, discerning disciple.<br><br>Now, last, "cast not away [thy] confidence."<sup>25</sup>Don't get distracted, discouraged, or dis­qualified. The word<i>confidence</i>is composed of two Latin words:<i>con,</i>meaning "with," and<i>fideo,</i>meaning "faith." So you see,<i>confidence</i>means "with faith." Faith is a powerful power that can move mountains and call down miracles. You have exercised your faith up to this point, so keep on. Even if things do not go according to your plan, even if you think you are being delayed because of the actions or nonactions of others, press forward. Continue to draw close to the Lord. Cherish virtue. Stand firm and stand tall. You have been reserved to be here now on account of your exceeding faith in the premortal existence in our Heavenly Father's plan.<sup>26</sup>Your life also has a plan, and, as you trust in the Lord, you will see that plan unfold in miraculous ways.<br><br>I believe that a great miracle is taking place right before our eyes. In these magnificent latter days you will see the "army [of the Lord] become very great."<sup>27</sup>You will see the gospel preached in every nation. You will emerge from the temple accompanied by angels and "endowed with power from on high."<sup>28</sup>This will enable you to navigate in increasingly turbulent times with a peaceful walk.<sup>29</sup><br><br>Young women, you will be the ones who will provide the example of virtuous womanhood and motherhood. You will continue to be virtuous, lovely, praiseworthy, and of good report. You will also be the ones who will provide the example of family life in a time when families are under attack, being redefined, and disintegrating. You will understand your roles and your responsibilities and thus will see no need to lobby for rights.<br><br>Young men, you will be the ones who will know that priesthood power--the power to act for God on the earth--is to be accessed only through purity. And you will use that priesthood power to bless generations.<br><br>For each of you, the very purity and virtue of your lives will attract the gaze of all the world in these latter days, and, because of you, many will say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord's house, and we will learn His ways and we will walk in His paths."<sup>30</sup>You will be the ones who will help establish Zion because you understand that Zion is the pure in heart.<br><br>In the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France, hangs a painting I love by Eugène Burnand. It depicts two of the Lord's disciples--Peter and John--running in the light of a new day toward the Savior and the empty tomb.<sup>31</sup>A print of this painting hangs in our home as well as in the homes of each of our children. It is a tangible representation of our vision as a family--to be dedicated disciples who will always be found running toward the Savior.<br><br>We are being invited to take part in the greatest race there has ever been. Make prophetic priorities your priorities. Dedicate yourself to discipleship. Don't let anyone tell you that you are too young. Seek the Holy Ghost. Become more fit for the kingdom and go forward with confidence.<br><br>I want you to know that you are magnificent. You are making more progress than you think you are. Your trials, your challenges, and your triumphs are forging your character and destiny. Your virtue and purity is tangible. And today, as I gaze into your eyes and faces, I truly believe that one virtuous young woman or young man led by the Spirit can change the world!<br><br>Truly these are days never to be forgotten. As you run your personal best, as you run your personal race, may you never forget that "they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."<sup>32</sup>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine S.

<h1>in the &quot;Image and Likeness of God&quot;:... - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to be here today to address you. I have been blessed with goodly parents, a noble and accomplished wife, and valiant children. I am especially honored to be here with my colleagues and with you, the students of Brigham Young University. Many devotional talks through the years have shaped my life.<br><br>Brother Hugh Nibley, one of the great teachers at Brigham Young University, used to describe our lives like going to a Broadway play. Arriving late, we miss the opening--and, leaving early, we miss the ending. To complicate matters, instead of being spectators when we arrive at the play, someone pushes us onstage and we hear a voice saying, "Do something intelligent." His point was that in order to "do something intelligent" with our lives on stage, we need to know the beginning and the ending of the play--and we only get that information through revelation.<br><h2><b>In the Beginning</b></h2><br>In the spirit of Brother Nibley's parable, let us sketch out, based on the scriptures, the beginning, the middle, and the end of the play in order to help us "do something intelligent."<br><br>In the beginning, the crown of Heavenly Father's creative work was the creation of the man and the woman: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (Genesis 1:27). This statement teaches us of our divine origins and that from the beginning "the measure of [our] creation" is to be like God (D&amp;amp;C 88:19; see also D&amp;amp;C 49:17).<br><br>Biblical scholars explain the two Hebrew terms behind the words<i>image</i>and<i>likeness</i>as references to being created in the form of God as well as to having His divine attributes.<sup>1</sup>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf summarized what we have learned from modern revelation when he taught: "We are created in the image of our heavenly parents; we are God's spirit children."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a>Whereas in ancient Near Eastern temples it was common to have the image of the god in that god's temple, in the Garden of Eden the image of God is found in the man and the woman. The biblical story further explains Adam and Eve's purpose. As bearers of the divine image, Adam and Eve were to be representatives of God in His creation--to "multiply, and replenish the earth"--and they were to care for the earth and the creatures therein (Genesis 1:28).<br><br>The effects of the Fall made it possible for Adam and Eve to experience mortality with agency--through which they could be tested and tried in order to become like their Creator. Armed with the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were able to exercise faith and obedience in discerning between good and evil and in choosing the good. According to Mosiah 3:19, we too must discern and choose either "the natural man," which "is an enemy to God," or yield "to the enticings of the Holy Spirit" to become "a saint through the atonement of Christ" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>Mosiah 3:19 is one of my favorite scriptures. In the summer of 1968 I was sitting with my Grandmother Payne at the Manti Pageant. I was fourteen, and it was the day that she would ruin my life. We had arrived early, so we had time to visit.<br><br>Grandma Payne was always interested in our lives, and she asked me, "David Rolph, what are you planning to do with your life?"<br><br>Being a child of the sixties, I thought long and hard before revealing my well-thought-out plans to a grown-up--a member of the Establishment. But I took the risk, and I carefully began to explain how I planned to leave our warlike and corrupt and materialistic society and retire to the woods to study the outdoors and to learn to play the guitar and to write poetry. I concluded my short sermon, declaring somewhat innocently, "I am going to be the natural man."<br><br>She smiled at me, almost incredulously, and said, "Boy, are you in trouble! Don't you know that the Book of Mormon teaches that the natural man is an enemy to God?"<br><br>I have never forgotten that day. It changed my life. I always read this passage with a smile--and I learned that it is risky to tell your plans to an adult.<br><br>Throughout history the Lord has commanded His children to be like Him. In the Old Testament He commanded, "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" (Leviticus 19:2). In the meridian of time Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament, came to earth to show us the way, to live among us, and to accomplish the Atonement and make it possible for us to return to our Heavenly Father. Jesus repeated the commandment to be like God, in whose image and likeness we were created: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48; see also 3 Nephi 12:48).<br><br>In the final scene of our play, the Savior returns in His glory to judge us, to see if we have "filled the measure of [our] creation" (D&amp;amp;C 88:19). Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught: "The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts--what we have<i>done.</i>It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts--what we have<i>become.</i>"<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a><br><br>Let us now turn to another scripture. In Moses 1, God dramatically introduced Himself to Moses by showing him the splendor and glory of His creations. And then He said, "And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6). Here the Lord teaches Moses (and us) that he is His son and reminds him of his divine potential, being created in the similitude of the Son. He then reveals to Moses the ultimate purpose of creation: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>These passages remind us that creation as described in the Bible is not just an event but is a process that continues to this day. This was eloquently stated in a BYU devotional years ago by one of my good friends, Professor George S. Tate:<br><br><i>Wasn't the Creation completed a very long time ago? Yes, in a sense it was. ... But in another sense, creation is ongoing, since its aim has not been fulfilled. If it is God's "work and [his] glory" to "bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (see Moses 1:39), creation is not complete until we have fulfilled the measure of our creation.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/george-s-tate_obedience-creation-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>The scriptures record God's continued creation of His children through covenant, and covenant is very important. I was reminded this morning of a Jewish midrash on Exodus 19, which recounts how the children of Israel were gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai, prepared to receive the law. The midrash describes how God impressed upon the children of Israel the weight of the covenant they were about to enter into. He uprooted Mount Sinai and lifted it in the air, where it hovered like a barrel over the children of Israel. And then God emphasized the crushing weight of the mountain and said, "If you accept the Torah, all is well; if not, here will be your grave."<sup>5</sup>As I walked in the building this morning, I looked up, and I want to tell you that, to me, this has felt like the weight of Mount Sinai.<br><br>The Lord uses covenant in the process of the spiritual creation of His children. Adam and Eve were required to be born again through water, the Spirit, and blood (see Moses 6:58–60). Ancient Israel is described as "the work of mine hands" created at Mount Sinai (Isaiah 29:23; see also Isaiah 43:21) and, throughout her history, as being shaped and formed as the clay in the hand of the potter (see Isaiah 45:9; Jeremiah 18:1–12). And Jesus taught that we must be born again "of water and of the Spirit" (John 3:5). Our lives, then, are about creation. They are about what it is we are becoming.<br><h2><b>The Master and His Apprentices</b></h2><br>Several years ago I began a discussion with the Lord that has proven to be a pivotal point in my life. One day, in a moment of serious self-reflection--which we commonly call a midlife crisis (and which for some of us began the day after our missions and continues to the present)--I sat down to determine if I had done anything significant with my life. I asked myself and the Lord this simple question: "What is my masterpiece? What is the culmination of all of my years of training and hard work?" As a young person I longed to be an artist or a musician, but after years of study and practice I concluded that my talents lay elsewhere. But still I continue to think of producing in my life a "masterpiece."<br><br>The Lord responded to my question with three thoughts.<br><br>First, He said to me that my task was to fulfill the measure of my creation--to be in the image and likeness of God, to be holy and perfect like Him. I walked over and looked into my spiritual mirror, and the result was not encouraging.<br><br>He then told me that my greatest work was to be my wife, Jo Ann, and my children.<br><br>And then the Lord said to me, "But you are not a master, so why do you think you can produce a masterpiece? You are just an apprentice in my workshop."<br><br>Having always been a lover of great art (my son in this room has walked every hall of the Louvre with me--it took us three days), I have been familiar with the institution of the apprentices that worked in the shops of the master artists and craftsmen. Especially during the Renaissance the great artists had workshops in which they employed apprentices to help them produce their masterpieces. Leonardo da Vinci served as an apprentice in the studio of Verrocchio, Michelangelo in the studio of Ghirlandaio, and Raphael in the studio of Perugino. The apprentices sought engagement in the workshops to do three things.<br><br>First, they came to get to know the master, his values, and his personality and to see up close how he produced his masterpieces.<br><br>Second, they came to learn from the master by doing. They began by doing the mundane jobs: sweeping the shop and preparing the pigments and the panels. As they progressed in skill, they were given more responsible tasks: painting backgrounds or minor figures, thus participating in the creation of great masterpieces.<br><br>Third, the apprentices came because they aspired to become like their masters. They hoped that by knowing the master and working by his side, they could one day become masters themselves.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Remember the Lord's conversation with Moses: "And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:6). In Heavenly Father's workshop, we, like Moses, are both God's masterpieces in process--"in the similitude of mine Only Begotten"--as well as His children, His sons and daughters, whom He has engaged in His workshop as apprentices, saying, "I have a work for you."<br><h2><b>How Do We Become in the "Image and Likeness of God"?</b></h2><br>I believe the metaphor of the master and his apprentices can help us better understand how we can become God's masterpieces--His children in the "image and likeness of God."<sup>7</sup>Just like an apprentice in a workshop, our first step is to get to know the Master. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God"<sup>8</sup>and to have "a<i>correct</i>idea of his . . . perfections, and attributes."<sup>9</sup>We know that we can come to know the Lord by studying the scriptures, through prayer, and by associating with others who know Him.<br><br>In order to help us to know the Master, Heavenly Father sent His Only Begotten Son to earth to reveal to us the Father: "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (John 5:19). Thus Jesus Christ came to earth as Heavenly Father's masterpiece in His image as well as in the image of a man, and through His Atonement Jesus Christ became the Master of the workshop. What we learn from the life of the Savior is that His primary attribute is love. He loves His Father and He loves us, and He expects us, as His creations and as His apprentices, to love one another: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35).<br><br>Through reading the accounts of the life of the Savior we can learn what He is like, what He values, and how He treated others. The Apostle Peter gave us an example of the power of knowing the Savior. Recall with me the account in Matthew when the Savior, who was walking upon the stormy sea, invited Peter to walk on the water with Him. When Peter left the boat and began to go to Jesus, the text records:<br><br><i>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</i><br><br><i>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</i>[Matthew 14:30–31]<br><br>Later, after the death and resurrection of the Savior, Peter found himself the head of the Church. Fearless in the face of persecution, Peter was teaching at the temple with John when a lame beggar asked for alms. Peter, following the example of the Savior, stretched out his hand and said:<br><br><i>Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</i><br><br><i>And he took him</i>[following the example of the Savior on the Sea of Galilee]<i>by the right hand, and lifted him up.</i>[Acts 3:6–7]<br><br>The second step is learning in the workshop by doing. Latter-day Saints are familiar with the gospel of doing: we do good works, we do our home teaching and visiting teaching, and we even call temple worship "temple work." The scriptures are replete with commandments of doing or not doing. The Savior simply said, "Come, follow me" (Luke 18:22; see also Matthew 4:19). By imitating the life of Jesus we learn obedience, compassion, love, and how to treat our fellows as if they were the Master: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>As we become skilled apprentices, we come to realize that the Master has given us a breathtaking responsibility in the workshop. In the beginning, Adam and Eve were commanded to "multiply, and replenish the earth" (Genesis 1:28), and they were given the gift of procreation--to create the bodies for the spirit children of our heavenly parents, in the image of God. This sacred gift of procreation is one of the greatest gifts imaginable and gives us the power to work as co-creators with God.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland described this role as follows:<br><br><i><b>You will never be more like God at any other time in this life than when you are expressing that particular power.</b>Of all the titles he has chosen for himself, Father is the one he declares, and Creation is his watchword--especially human creation, creation in his image.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Genesis 5:3 records, "And Adam . . . begat a son in his own likeness, after his image." Here is where the fun begins, as Heavenly Father has given us the privilege of creating these children in our image as well. The results can be both spectacular and comical. When we first held our babies, we would greet each new spirit with wonder, and then we would begin to note the distribution of the genes from our families. As we raise our children in the image and likeness of God, we are shocked as they assume our image and likeness as well. One morning, a few days after I finished a grueling two years working on my dissertation, we were lying on our bed when our darling two-and-a-half-year-old son raced into the room and began jumping on the bed, gleefully shouting, "I am sure glad that darned dissertation is done!" But he didn't say "darned"!<br><br>Several years later our family was living in New York City for the summer, and we were attending a scholarly workshop together with lots of other aspiring scholars. Many of my colleagues were Christian, and one week we decided to perform an ecumenical gesture by attending the Riverside Church with my Christian colleagues. We got up in the morning and announced to our children that we were going to the Riverside Church, and our little boy said, "Wow, I really don't want to put on my crunchy clothes today, and I really don't want to go to that church." First I pleaded. Then I just grabbed his arm and dragged him out the door. As we got to the Riverside Church and went through the entrance, we looked in and realized that people had not brought their children to this meeting. The two thousand people in the church were sitting there quietly, waiting for the beginning of the meeting, and my five-year-old son shouted out, "But Daddy, this isn't even the true church!" So much for the ecumenical gesture of the Seelys that week.<br><br>One of the most exhilarating jobs in the workshop is to work with Heavenly Father's children in the creation of families. And it is here that our family has experienced the grandest of adventures. But helping to create Heavenly Father's children in His image and likeness is not confined to parenthood. Throughout our lives we become co-creators with the Master in our relationships with all of those around us: our families, friends, mission companions, roommates, colleagues, teachers, and students, as well as those we visit teach and home teach.<br><br>Let me share with you several important things that I have learned in the workshop as we have worked as co-creators with the Master. The image and likeness of God is not to be found in outward appearances--it is to be found in our hearts. In our modern culture, especially in the media, there is overwhelming attention and concern given to "image," which is almost always a reference to outward appearances. A powerful story in the scriptures addresses this issue. When the prophet Samuel was sent to find the Lord's anointed among the sons of Jesse in Bethlehem, he examined the seven eldest sons of Jesse, expecting to find among them the next king of Israel. He was disappointed to find that none of them was the one the Lord had chosen, and he finally had Jesse send for his youngest son, David. The Lord then taught us a lesson that should pierce our souls: "For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7). The Lord wants us to learn to see ourselves and each other as He sees us: not looking on outward appearances but looking on the heart. In our search for friends, associates, and, most important, our future spouses, we need to learn to see each other "not as man seeth" but as "the Lord looketh on the heart."<br><br>Another thing I have learned in the workshop is that being created in the image and likeness of God does not mean that we are all the same. As spirit children of Heavenly Father, we come to earth with our individuality. Heavenly Father tells us that He has blessed us with different spiritual gifts:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12; see also 1 Corinthians 12]<br><br>President James E. Faust taught:<br><br><i>We do not lose our identity in becoming members of this church. ... We say to all who have joined the Church, keep all that is noble, good, and uplifting in your culture and personal identity.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/04/heirs-to-the-kingdom-of-god.p18,p19?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>11</sup></a><br><br>As we look through the scriptures, we see the way that the Lord has made use of many different individuals: in the Old Testament there was a Moses and an Aaron, a Ruth and an Esther; in the New Testament a Peter and a Paul, a Mary and a Martha; and in our day a Joseph Smith and a Brigham Young, a Gordon B. Hinckley and a Thomas S. Monson.<br><br>In the workshop we come to appreciate that the Lord's masterpieces are created through a great price. Abraham demonstrated the ultimate faith in God when he took his son Isaac to sacrifice him on Mount Moriah. The Lord exclaimed, "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me" (Genesis 22:12). On that day Abraham showed us the image of God the Father when he, like his Heavenly Father, demonstrated his willingness to sacrifice his beloved son, and Isaac showed us the image of God the Son as he willingly submitted to the will of his father.<br><br>We are surrounded by many who have taught us by example the principles of faith, obedience, and sacrifice. In the<i>Lectures on Faith</i>we are taught, "The faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things."<sup>12</sup><br><br>My grandfather J. Leo Seely received a mission call in 1914 to serve the Lord in Ireland. He left his wife and little children for two years. The depth of his sacrifice has become clear to us as we have read their letters. Upon his return he grabbed my grandmother in an embrace, and his little daughter Ina, who hadn't seen her father for years, raced out to chastise this unfamiliar man, shouting, "You naughty man, leave my mother alone!"<br><br>Because of the power of this man's example and that of my noble grandmother, my father served a mission, and then over fifty of his grandchildren and now his great-grandchildren have gone forth to serve the Lord in missions that cover the world. Great-Great-Grandfather Bramall crossed the plains seven times and served five missions to England. And Great-Grandmother Sumsion began a great tradition of sister missionary service followed by her daughter, her granddaughters, and now her great-granddaughters. As we watch our children--and as you watch your friends and families--open mission calls, we see the image of God in a person who is willing to follow in the footsteps of the Savior to sacrifice for the salvation of His children. They have the faith and the courage to go wherever the Lord calls them.<br><br>Esau is another unheralded example of one who showed us how to shape our lives in the image of God. When his brother, Jacob, tricked him out of the birthright, Esau was enraged to the point of seeking to kill his brother. After many years of avoiding each other, there was a dramatic moment when Jacob encountered his brother. Jacob, fearing for his life, prepared gifts for his brother. When the moment of the encounter came and Jacob met his brother, Esau unexpectedly forgave him. Looking into Esau's forgiving face, Jacob exclaimed, "For therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God" (Genesis 33:10).<br><br>The image of God is forgiveness. As Brother Nibley always used to remind us, "The two things you can do in life are to repent and forgive."<sup>13</sup><br><br>The third step of our apprenticeship is the most important and perhaps the most difficult. Ultimately we are commanded to "be holy" and to "be perfect" like the Master. As we live the gospel and fill our lives with knowing and doing, something miraculous happens to us: we begin to become like the Savior and like our Father in Heaven. But we cannot complete the process of becoming like God on our own. Only the Master can make a masterpiece, and only He can make us in His own image.<br><br>Let me tell you about something I love. There is a fragment of a Dead Sea scroll from Cave 4 at Qumran that I had the privilege to work on several years ago. It is a piece of a hymn called<i>Barkhi Nafshi--</i>"Bless, O My Soul." One cold winter day I was in the workroom at the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem examining this fragment. It had not yet been mounted in a protective frame, and a gust of wind came through the window and blew the fragile fragment onto the floor. Horrified, I quickly got a large piece of paper and knelt down to scoop it up. As I stood to put it back onto the table, I was overcome with emotion--holding in my hands this precious piece of the past, a piece of leather that contained the hymn of praise from a Jewish author two thousand years ago. In this fragment of text the ancient hymnist expressed the mystery of acquiring the attributes of God: "Bless, O my soul, the Lord. ... He has been gracious to the needy, and he has opened their eyes to see his ways, and their ears to hear his teaching. And he has circumcised the foreskins of their heart" (4Q434 1.i.1–4).<sup>14</sup> Paraphrasing from Deuteronomy (10:16–17; 30:6), another sacred text that I love, the ancient author of this poem acknowledges that it is only God who can, through His grace, open our eyes and ears and change our hearts.<br><br>This doctrine is taught throughout the scriptures. The Lord says in Ezekiel, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you" (Ezekiel 36:26). And Paul describes the death of "our old man" and the birth of the new that we experience at baptism (Romans 6:6; see verses 1–6).<br><br>Occasionally things go wrong in the workshop, and we, as the Master's masterpieces in progress, become distorted or deformed. Sometimes the problem is sin--giving in to the enticings of the natural man. Sometimes it is discouragement, disappointment, sickness, or death. The Master of the workshop came to earth and, as explained by Alma, experienced mortal "infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:12). He has the power to cleanse us, to heal us, and to restore us to His image and likeness, for the Atonement "bring[s] about the bowels of mercy" that "can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety" (Alma 34:15–16).<br><br>I testify that the power of the Atonement is real and that His "grace is sufficient" (Ether 12:27). As we call upon our Father in Heaven in repentance, through the power of the Savior's Atonement we can find forgiveness. Through the Holy Ghost He can send encouragement and comfort. We as apprentices in the workshop should remember that, as my daughter says, "often the Holy Ghost needs helpers." We can help the Master by reaching out to those around us, offering forgiveness, encouragement, and comfort.<br><br>At this very moment in our lives we are in the process of creation--of choosing between the natural man and between becoming, through the power of the grace of our Savior, individuals in the image and likeness of God. As apprentices in His workshop, the Lord has called us to work with Him in producing His masterpieces--His children in His own image. We do so as families, as mothers and fathers, as sons and daughters, as brothers and sisters in the gospel, as missionaries, as teachers and students and through service to our fellowman. There is great joy in the workshop as we see the miraculous growth and the changes of heart that occur through the power of the Atonement. The eternal and enduring masterpieces that we produce in our lives are not works of art or music or scholarly books or articles--they are the people around us. As we help the Master with His masterpieces, we are engaged in His work and His glory: "the immortality and eternal life of man."<br><br>I find joy in being an apprentice in the Savior's workshop, and I aspire to be like Him. As we work in the Lord's kingdom, serving His children, we can become like Him.<br><br>I love the Lord Jesus Christ. I testify that He lives and He loves us, and I pray "that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (Moroni 7:48). In the name of our Master, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David Rolph Seely was a BYU professor of ancient scripture when this devotional address was given on29January 2013.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. "The 'image' is problematic in its own right. For in most of its occurrences, [<i>ṣelem</i>] 'image' is a concrete noun. And as such, it refers to a representation of form, figure, or physical appearance (see §7.2.1). Thus if the human race is created in the 'image of God', there is an unavoidable logical implication: God must also be material, physical, corporeal, and, to a certain degree, humanoid (see also §7.1.4)" (W. Randall Garr,<i>In His Own Image and Likeness: Humanity, Divinity, and Monotheism,</i>vol. 15 of<i>Culture and History of the Ancient Near East,</i>ed. Baruch Halpern, Manfred H. E. Weippert, Theo P. J. van den Hout, and Irene J. Winter [Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2003], 5–6).<br><br>John H. Walton notes that in ancient Near Eastern cultures the "image of god" can also refer to the idealized representation of the attributes of the deity. For example, "When the Assyrian king Esarhaddon is referred to as 'the perfect likeness of the god,' it is his qualities and his attributes that are meant. ... In the Israelite context as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, people are in the image of God in that they embody his qualities and do his work" (<i>Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible</i>[Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Academic, 2006], 212).<br><br>2.

<h1>tional: &quot;Live Your Life with Purpose&quot; by Janie Penfield</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am humbled to be with you today. I am grateful for family, friends, and colleagues who are in the audience and watching at home to support me. I have prayed diligently over the past months that something I say today will benefit each of us, and I do that now as well.<br><br>I am an adventure seeker, especially in the outdoors. I love to hike, bike, swim, and ski. Through my many adventures I have learned that each one must be planned with clear purposes or objectives--to summit a peak, to complete a course, or to enjoy the views. I have found that planning with purpose is the best way to ensure that each adventure is successful.<br><br>For example, I love to Nordic ski. As with all skiing, there is a trail map that allows you to chart a successful course through the woods and terrain. My favorite place to ski is at Sundance's Nordic Center. The trails lead you through evergreen and aspen trees and include views of Mount Timpanogos and frozen Stewart Falls. There are several trails to choose from; some are out of the way and less traveled than others. All the trails are surrounded by ungroomed or wooded ground with unknown obstacles beneath the meringue-like layer of snow. Leaving the trail could be troublesome or even perilous.<br><br>Each ski trek begins with the question Where to? followed by Which route? Each trail takes us to a different spot with different options for adventure and scenery--a steep climb, a flat meadow, or an incredible view. Before we begin to ski we must determine the purpose of our trek so we know which trails to take. Then we must ski on course or we will not reach our destination.<br><h2><strong>Determine Your Purpose</strong></h2><br>We are here on earth in a type of adventure. We left our Heavenly Father to obtain bodies, to be tested, to make covenants, to gain knowledge and experience, and to hopefully return to live with Him. But we do not always remember these purposes. Many who do not have the gospel have forgotten these purposes because of the veil. We often get weighed down by the daily monotony of school, church, family, and work and forget about our aspirations--aspirations that our Heavenly Father wants us to have. We often even get distracted and waylaid by "good" things.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught:<br><br><i>As we consider various choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. Even though a particular choice is more costly, its far greater value may make it the best choice of all.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/good-better-best?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good, Better, Best</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2007, 104–5]<br><br>He goes on to say that "we have to forego some good things in order to choose others that are better or best because they develop faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen our families" ("Good, Better, Best," 107). There are many good things that we can do, but we must stay true to our purpose and live the life of a disciple. We can get married or, better/best, we can get married in the temple. We can pray for the missionaries or, better/best, we can invite our friends and family to visit with them in our homes.<br><br>Individually we may become discouraged because of the distance between us and the mortal life we've aspired to. We may not be married, have children, or have the degree or success that we thought would give us the life we'd planned. Fame, fortune, fashion, and fun will play a part in our eventual destination. But we have the power to control what role, if any, these play in keeping us on or taking us off the path of discipleship. Our collection of choices will determine our final destination.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>Eternal life in the kingdom of our Father is</i>[our]<i>goal. Such a goal is not achieved in one glorious attempt but rather is the result of a lifetime of righteousness, an accumulation of wise choices, even a constancy of purpose.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_decisions-determine-destiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decisions Determine Destiny</a>," BYU devotional address, 6 November 2005]<br><br>So what can we do to ensure that we build a lifetime of righteousness and accumulate wise choices? We can live our life with purpose--the purpose to gain eternal life and be counted as a disciple of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Keeping our destination or the purpose of our life in mind influences our decisions. We are choosing friends, majors, careers, social activities, priorities, and many more things. But the most important decision that we must map out is the course to our destination if we are ever to get there. Where are we skiing to? If we make a conscious decision to be on the Lord's side and to seek the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom, then many of our decisions in daily life fall into place. Knowing that we will<i>not</i>go toward so many other destinations provides us with significant direction. We can make our judgments and decisions based on the decided purpose of our life. Does this friend bring me closer to or further from the Spirit? Does this major or career allow me to be the disciple of Christ I aspire to be? Does this activity keep me close to the Lord? Committing to achieve the greatest possible outcome from mortality frees us from much of the push and pull of the world.<br><br>In the last general conference President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said, "The foundational principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ can affect our life's direction for good, if only we will apply them" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/of-regrets-and-resolutions?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Regrets and Resolutions</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 21). If we want to enjoy eternal life we must apply the principles President Uchtdorf is referring to and become disciples of Christ. As he says, "The pursuit of holiness and happiness ... is the path to our best and happiest self" ("Of Regrets," 23). We must plan our lives with the purpose of becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ. President Uchtdorf says we can do this by following the Savior, striving to be like Him, listening to and obeying the Spirit's promptings, and devoting ourselves to the pursuit of holiness and happiness (see "Of Regrets," 23). Becoming a disciple also includes being baptized, making and keeping temple covenants, and building the kingdom of God.<br><br>It can sometimes be difficult to remember our predetermined course. The scriptures and the prophets counsel us to remember the things of the Spirit--our Savior and the Atonement, our covenants, and the commandments. Remembering helps us keep proper perspective and focus on our purpose. We must choose to remember. We must remember what we want and why we want it. President Henry B. Erying taught us that "the key to the remembering that brings and maintains testimony is receiving the Holy Ghost as a companion" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/o-remember-remember?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O Remember, Remember</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2007, 68). If we live worthy of the Holy Ghost we will remember our purpose. The Savior taught, "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26).<br><h2><strong>Determine Your Course</strong></h2><br>Once we are fixed on our purpose, we must determine our course to fulfill that purpose. We have to make a plan for how we will reach our destination.<br><br>Last January there were twelve of us geared up in Wyoming with our skis on, ready to go. Granite Hot Springs was over ten miles in front of us. We knew we needed to stay on the road and keep going in spite of the serious negative temperatures, the hills, and the lack of sunshine. We also planned to take time to enjoy the scenery around us. We had planned to do an out-and-back route of over twenty miles in a day, and we needed to start early, stay together, keep fueled, keep moving, and stay the course. We did, and we finished the out-and-back trek exhausted!<br><br>Just as my friends and I were as we skied on our adventure in Wyoming, we must be fixed on our course and our purpose. We must continue to press forward despite adverse conditions. We must not be deterred by challenges--big and small--all the while taking in the beauty and wonders mortality affords us.<br><br>The map to navigate life on earth has been provided to us through the restoration of the gospel. The standard works, modern-day prophets, and inspired leaders help us navigate through the challenges of mortality. Lehi's dream is a broad sketch of mortality. The latter-day prophets fill in the challenges and specific guidance for our day, helping us keep hold of the iron rod. We must determine our course to ensure that our daily choices have a chance of leading us to eternal life--we will not arrive there by chance. In Doctrine and Covenants 132:22 we read, "For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives." We need to be on the path when we reach the gate. Having the goal of eternal life, we know where we can look for direction to stay on the narrow way and to find the strait gate.<br><br>The scriptures and the teachings of the prophets have provided us with a course for our life on earth. The path of discipleship is the path that runs within reach of the iron rod. We move each hand and each foot in front of the other, progressing as we make decisions to prioritize the work of the Lord, the keeping of our covenants, and our constant efforts to emulate the Savior. What is on the narrow way? Temple marriage, missionary service, paying a full tithe, keeping the Sabbath day holy, fulfilling callings, being charitable--and the list goes on.<br><br>Staying on the strait and narrow path requires us to make consistent "best" choices. As a skier, in order to return to the trailhead you have to take the right trails, turn at the right times, and have the skill to descend the mountain safely. As many inexperienced Nordic skiers have noted, the hills look easy to navigate until you strap on boots that only bind in the front and skis that are slightly wider than Popsicle sticks. We must chart our course carefully. Where will we turn, go straight, or climb? The trail map and master teachers will give us all of the information we need.<br><br>We learn from Elder L. Lionel Kendrick that the guidance we need is in the scriptures. He said:<br><br><i>Those revelations received by prophets are given to us in the form of scripture or by the voice of the living prophets. Thus, the scriptures become a road map, a set of divine directions to assist us on our journey through mortality and our return trip home.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/04/search-the-scriptures?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Search the Scriptures</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1993, 13]<br><br>Just as Lehi and his family looked to the Liahona for direction through the wilderness to the promised land, we should let the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets serve as our map as we make our way through the wilderness of mortality.<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>We all search for happiness, and we all try to find our own "happily ever after." The truth is, God knows how to get there! He has created a map for you; He knows the way. ... The map is available to all. It gives explicit directions of what to do and where to go to everyone who is striving to come unto Christ.</i>["Your Happily Ever After,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 126–27]<br><br>All you have to do is trust your Heavenly Father--trust Him enough to follow His plan, keep your covenants, and keep His commandments.<br><br>President Uchtdorf continued:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, not all will follow the map. They may look at it. They may think it is reasonable, perhaps even true. But they do not follow the divine directions. Many believe that any road will take them to a "happily ever after."</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/your-happily-ever-after?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Happily Ever After</a>," 127]<br><br>As members of the Church, we know that not all roads or trails lead to the eternal life we seek. "Happily ever after" will only be ours if we choose to follow the Savior and be His disciples.<br><br>We are constantly making decisions, and if your life is like mine, most of those decisions are made while in "survival mode." This is decision making in the moment, instead of planning out a course and moving forward when the time is right. This is not the best way to make decisions, for when I live in survival mode, I too often fail to accomplish the things I prioritized in my mind--that phone call to a friend, lunch with my brother, an evening at the temple, a workout, and even what I'm going to do on vacation. It is also while I am in survival mode that I see opportunities pass me by--a weakening friendship with a kindred spirit, waning family relationships, a decrease in desire to do the things to stay close to the Spirit, decreased fitness level, and even a missed opportunity to kayak the Napoli Coast in Hawaii! (How did I let that happen?)<br><br>Perhaps you are like me. Perhaps you, too, let the chaos of life, your studies, your calling, your job, or your fun crowd out the opportunities the Spirit has to speak to you. Perhaps your prayers have become hurried or your scripture study is more reading than study. Perhaps you have reshuffled your priorities and have put staying close to the Spirit off to the side simply as a result of<i>not</i>prioritizing it. President Uchtdorf said, "Discipleship is the pursuit of holiness and happiness. It is the path to our best and happiest self" ("Of Regrets," 23). So it follows that pursuing and prioritizing discipleship will lead us to the best life we can build for ourselves on earth, but we have to seek it by choosing to be a disciple of Christ. We have to choose it by being forgiving, charitable, grateful, and anxiously engaged in serving others. We have to make discipleship our course.<br><br>How do we know what we can do to be a disciple? How do we know what we can do to fulfill our purpose on earth and build the kingdom of God? We have to ask Him--through prayer. The scriptures have taught us that the Lord will give us answers to our prayers: "Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2). We will hear by the whisperings of the Spirit what we can do to be more like Christ. We will be quietly drawn to opportunities that will allow us to serve on His behalf. We will find ourselves using our talents to build the kingdom of God if we follow the guidance in our heart.<br><br>In the last general conference Elder Craig C. Christensen taught:<br><br><i>Through the gift of the Holy Ghost, we receive added capacity and spiritual gifts, increased revelation and protection, steady guidance and direction, and the promised blessings of sanctification and exaltation in the celestial kingdom. All of these blessings are given as a result of our personal desire to receive them and come as we align our lives with the will of God and seek His constant direction.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/an-unspeakable-gift-from-god?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Unspeakable Gift from God</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 14]<br><br>When Alma gives counsel to his son Helaman, he too tells him to stay aligned with our Heavenly Father and seek His guidance: "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). What great counsel--from both Elder Christensen and Alma. Alma continued to call on Helaman to "counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good" (Alma 37:37). We know how to get the direction of the Spirit. Now we have to do it.<br><br>How can we allocate our time, talents, and resources to align with our purpose and stay on course? We can do it through goals. I have a lot of goals that aren't the New Year's type of goals. I have the goal of being married in the temple, having and raising children in the gospel, and witnessing them serve missions and raise a righteous posterity. I have the goal of serving a mission myself. I have the goal of being worthy of eternal life with my Father in Heaven and with my family. I have the goal of making my earthly and my heavenly parents proud because I have heeded their counsel and made the gospel of Jesus Christ an integral part of my life. I have the goal of being happy here on earth and in the eternities.<br><br>Your goals may be similar to mine. These are our individual course markings. They are the significant choices in our lives that allow us to recognize that we are in alignment with our Father in Heaven. He has given us the personal guidance and direction we need to accomplish our goals.<br><br>The companionship of the Holy Ghost provides us with unlimited personal revelation, direction, comfort, strength, and guidance from God. Humility and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ are essential to being worthy of personal revelation and answers to our prayers. All answers do not come when we ask for them. They often come as Alma describes our faith growing: over time as we ponder, study, and seek direction from the Lord (see Alma 32). President Boyd K. Packer tells us that "[we] must learn to seek the power and direction that is available to [us], and then follow that course no matter what" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2012/04/how-to-survive-in-enemy-territory?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Survive in Enemy Territory</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 2012, 29).<br><br>We then learn in Doctrine and Covenants 45:57: "For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day." We must choose to be wise and take the Holy Spirit for our guide. We can benefit from the direction of the Holy Ghost in everything we do. He will guide me--helping me avoid cliffs while skiing, potholes while biking, and terrible snafus at work--if I seek His direction and am aligned with Him and His will.<br><br>Prayer is our communication piece with our Heavenly Father, and the Holy Ghost is His communication piece with us. We must keep the line open by seeking out the Father in prayer and by living worthy of the Holy Ghost's companionship. President Packer also taught:<br><br>[We]<i>can always have a direct line of communication with</i>[our]<i>Father in Heaven. Do not allow the adversary to convince you that no one is listening on the other end. Your prayers are always heard. You are never alone!</i>["How to Survive," 29]<br><h2><strong>Staying on Course</strong></h2><br>Over the last few years I have participated in several road bike rides with wonderful friends. To get in the full mileage--sixty, eighty, or one hundred miles--the courses are marked on the streets with colored arrows and spray paint. There are signs at intersections, and there are usually other riders to follow. However, on more than three different occasions we have ended up off course. On one ride my friends and I mistakenly followed other riders off course--they were riding a different route than we were. On another ride we found the rest stop from the "less traveled" side, as we had apparently missed a turn or two. And on yet another ride we knew we were close to the finish line because of the traffic and noise, but we couldn't find the roads that led us to it. We couldn't find any markings. On each of these road rides my friends and I did get back on course and finish the race, and we learned several lessons--each of which are transferable to our lives.<br><br>If we are to reach our intended destination, we must pay attention to the big and the small course markings. In life these markings are not spray-painted arrows and signs; instead they are advancements, covenants, and the companionship of the Spirit. If we are not committed to our course and purpose, we will move with the push and pull of the world, away from the path that leads us to return to our Father in Heaven. We must be committed, and we must do all that we can to stay the course. We must look to the prophets to learn how to read the course's legend to ensure that we stay firmly planted on the strait and narrow path, holding onto the iron rod with both hands.<br><br>I don't know exactly when my friends and I went off course on these three occasions, but I can clearly remember when we realized it. Our surroundings weren't familiar or expected, we didn't have the biking companions we'd had before, and when we looked for course markings, we could not find them. There are too many things that could have distracted us and allowed us to get off course, even when we were within blocks of the finish line. What distracted us is far less important than how we got off course. It happened so subtly that we didn't notice until we were off the course--not right next to it or parallel to it, but off.<br><br>So it is with the strait and narrow path. At one point in our lives we have two feet firmly planted on it. With a change of roommates or friends, a new girl- or boyfriend, a new city, a new schedule, or even a new job, we can slowly start moving to the path's edge until we realize that we are doing things we never imagined doing: we haven't prayed for days or weeks, we pass on spiritual things, our scriptures are covered in layers of dust, or so many other things happen that indicate we haven't been feeding our testimony the nourishment it needs. Most of the time we cannot pinpoint what changed in our life, but we know our testimony isn't as firm as it once was. Maybe we can't even remember why we keep the commandments.<br><br>But there are many things we can do to ensure that we stay on course--on the strait and narrow path. Like my friends and I learned on our road-riding races, we must keep a lookout for the course markings or warning signs. The prophets and the scriptures give us significant counsel on how to stay on course and live our lives with the right purpose. Elder Quentin L. Cook taught, "Immersion in the scriptures is essential for spiritual nourishment" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/can-ye-feel-so-now?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can Ye Feel So Now</a>?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 7). We need to make sure we are constantly feeding ourselves spiritually from the scriptures. Do you immerse yourself in the scriptures?<br><br>Mother Teresa and Alma both reminded us of the power of small acts in our lives such as prayer, scripture study, and charity. Mother Teresa said, "Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies" (<i>In the Heart of the World: Thoughts, Stories and Prayers</i>[Novato, California: New World Library, 1997], 15). Alma taught:<br><br><i>By small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</i><br><br><i>... And by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</i>[Alma 37:6–7]<br><br>There are no small things, because combined, they are our strength and they will bring about our salvation!<br><br>There are a few other seemingly "small" things that will have a great impact on our ability to stay true to our purpose. One of these seemingly small things is our friends. Who do we choose to associate with? Who do we choose to date? To marry? To seek advice from and counsel with? To play and study with? President Thomas S. Monson said, "Choose your friends with caution" ("Decisions Determine Destiny"). We must cautiously choose who we allow to have a great impact on our lives. We do many "small" things with our friends. Brother Scott Robley on the Mormon Channel said that true friends treat you like a campsite--they leave you better than they found you (see Mormon Channel,<i>For the Youth,</i>"Mapping Your Way," part 2, episode 25, at 21:40; www.mormonchannel.org/for-the-youth/25). We all have companions in our time on earth. They may be siblings, friends, spouses, missionary companions, and even strangers who observe us or briefly interact with us. Are you the true friend you should be to those you are with, and are they the friends they should be for you? Do your friends make it easier for you to live the gospel or not? Do they help you draw closer to the Spirit, even in small degrees? Do they leave you better than they found you, and you them?<br><br>If we do not bolster and feed our faith, we will not have the strength to keep covenants or commandments and stay on course. Maintaining our testimony and staying on course will require righteousness and regular repentance. It will require great faith. We must be spiritually strong. We must live worthy of the Holy Ghost's companionship. Elder D. Todd Christofferson said, "Faith comes by the witness of the Holy Spirit to our souls, Spirit to spirit, as we hear or read the word of God. And faith matures as we continue to feast upon the word" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/the-blessing-of-scripture?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Blessing of Scripture</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 35). We must delve into the scriptures to know what to do in times of trial, how to help others, and how to answer our questions. The answers are in them. We learn about the Master Teacher and His ways in the scriptures. By studying the scriptures we develop our faith and learn about the Savior, His teachings, the commandments, our Father, and the plan of salvation. Studying the scriptures will keep us on course.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson has given us exceptional counsel for how to stay on course:<br><br><i>Obey the laws of God. They are given to us by a loving Heavenly Father. When they are obeyed, our lives will be more fulfilling, less complicated. Our challenges and problems will be easier to bear. We will receive the Lord's promised blessings. ...</i><br><br><i>... Make every decision you contemplate pass this test: "What does it do to me? What does it do for me?" And let your code of conduct emphasize not "What will others think?" but rather "What will I think of myself?" Be influenced by that still, small voice. ... Open your hearts, even your very souls, to the sound of that special voice which testifies of truth.</i>["Believe, Obey, and Endure,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2012, 128, 129]<br><br>We need to open our hearts to that special voice, as President Monson said. The Holy Ghost is the only companion of constancy. All of the others will leave us--even if only temporarily--to run errands, go to class, or go to work for the day. The Holy Ghost will be a constant presence in our lives if we will live worthily. We control the level of influence He has in our lives. Do we listen to or ignore Him? Do we act or relax? Do we provide an environment that will allow the Holy Ghost to remain with us? Do we remove the "worldly habits, customs, and traditions" from our lives (Robert D. Hales, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/being-a-more-christian-christian?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Being a More Christian Christian</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2012, 90)?<br><br>As the hymn by Penelope Moody Allen says:<br><br><i>Let the Holy Spirit guide;</i><br><i>Let him teach us what is true.</i><br><i>He will testify of Christ,</i><br><i>Light our minds with heaven's view.</i><br><br><i>Let the Holy Spirit guard;</i><br><i>Let his whisper govern choice.</i><br><i>He will lead us safely home</i><br><i>If we listen to his voice.</i><br><br><i>Let the Spirit heal our hearts</i><br><i>Thru his quiet, gentle pow'r.</i><br><i>May we purify our lives</i><br><i>To receive him hour by hour.</i><br>["Let the Holy Spirit Guide,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 143]<br><br>While the challenges of each day do not fade with each sunset, I know that if we can do as the prophets have counseled us, we will be able to continue moving forward on the strait and narrow path. I also know that this path will lead us to eternal life--a life worth every amount of effort required to get there. If we will firmly establish the purpose of our life and stay the course that leads us to it, we will live in the house the Lord has prepared for us "among the mansions of [our] Father" (Ether 12:32).<br><br>Let Heavenly Father guide and direct you. Live your life with purpose.<br><br>I know the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know He is our Savior. I know Thomas S. Monson is a prophet of God, and I know our Father in Heaven loves us and leads us through the Holy Ghost. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Janie Penfield was a BYU associate athletic ­directorwhen this devotional address was given on5February 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>tional: &quot;Living a Reverent Life&quot; by Donald L. Hallstrom</h1>
<br>
<br>
Being on the Brigham Young University campus with you extraordinary students, our remarkable administration (including my colleague and friend President Cecil O. Samuelson), and the outstanding faculty is always a thrill. Whenever I am here, nostalgically I recall entering BYU as a freshman (now forty-five years ago) and then meeting Diane here four years later. How else could a boy from Hawaii and a girl from southern Alberta, Canada, meet, fall in love, and marry? We both graduated in 1973, and she did it six months pregnant! Facilitating the introductions needed to begin eternal relationships is an important role of this university.<br><br>One of the things we deeply enjoy during these devotionals is the performance--the worshipful performance--of a highly accomplished choral group or choir. Today is no exception. It always causes me to think of the story I heard about someone who observed the signboard in front of a church that is not of our faith. Announcing the coming week's sermon, the sign said, "What Is Hell Really Like?" Along the bottom of the sign, as if in response, it said, "Come Hear Our Choir!" I believe we could put a sign in front of the Marriott Center on devotional days with the bold but accurate words "What Is Heaven Really Like? Come Hear Our Choir!"<br><br>Diane and I have been privileged to observe the influence of BYU around the world. During our worldwide travels and while residing in international locations, we have personally witnessed the impact of performing groups, study abroad students, faculty lecturers, and outreach programs in building relationships of trust for the university and for the Church. Additionally and significantly, graduates of this institution are powerful tools of the Lord, actively and effectively being used to further His kingdom throughout the world.<br><br>The good accomplished by this university is extraordinary. Each of us should want to be an active participant in that good. In the "Preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation" (heading of D&amp;amp;C 1), speaking of "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth," the Lord states that He is "well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30). I am confident the Lord is well pleased with BYU--"collectively." Let each of us "individually" be a positive contributor to the Lord's joy in this institution.<br><br>We meet here today in the name of Jesus Christ. We meet under the direction of His holy Apostles, who have given me this assignment to be with you. It is not important that I am the one here. I am simply an ambassador, an envoy. My desire is to appropriately represent the Lord and His Apostles and for the true teacher in this meeting to be the Holy Spirit.<br><br>When we gather in a meeting of the Church like this one, we all have an important duty. Most may assume that I have the greatest responsibility: to give a talk that is informative and interesting. I fully accept my role and have prayerfully prepared; however, I share the success of this meeting with each of you. Some may leave inspired, others not. It is really our choice. Each of us has access to the inspiration and revelation that can come to us directly from the Spirit, unfiltered by a speaker. All have different needs and circumstances, and the Spirit can effectively communicate with each of us. Consequently, different messages may be heard today. That is as it should be.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants states (and this was given by way of commandment) "that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act . . . upon the points of my law" (D&amp;amp;C 43:8). In the next verse it says, "And thus ye shall . . . be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me" (D&amp;amp;C 43:9). We share the responsibility to instruct and be edified, but the duty to act is ours individually. And that is the key! When we participate with the intention to act (meaning to improve), the Spirit has full access to our hearts and minds. "And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they . . . exercise faith in me"--remember, faith is a principle of action and of power--"I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together" (D&amp;amp;C 44:2). That is my hope for this meeting.<br><br>I speak of a subject today that may appear to be an unusual one for this setting. I speak of reverence. Upon hearing that word, many may quickly reflect that reverence is merely the act of keeping our children and ourselves quiet when we attend meetings of the Church. I suggest that is not reverence--it is simply one of the ways we demonstrate our reverence. Reverence is to revere, to have a profound love and respect for Deity. In referring to God the Father, latter-day scripture reads: "Before whose throne all things bow in humble reverence, and give him glory forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 76:93).<br><br>With the Pharisees and Sadducees gathered together, one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i>[Matthew 22:36–38]<br><br>While serving as president of the Church, David O. McKay stated:<br><br><i>Inseparable from the acceptance of the existence of God is an attitude of reverence, to which I wish now to call attention most earnestly to the entire Church. The greatest manifestation of spirituality is reverence; indeed, reverence is spirituality. Reverence is profound respect mingled with love. It is "a complex emotion made up of mingled feelings of the soul."</i>[Thomas]<i>Carlyle</i>[the Scottish philosopher]<i>says it is "the highest of human feelings." I have said . . . that if reverence is the highest, then irreverence is the lowest state in which a man can live in the world.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1956, 6; quoting Charles Edward Jefferson,<i>The Character of Jesus</i>(New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1908), 312, and Thomas Carlyle, "On Boswell's Life of Johnson" (1832)]<br><br>In April 2001 general conference, President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>I fear that through prosperity many of us have been preoccupied with what Daniel called "gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know"</i>[Daniel 5:23].<i>These, of course, are idols.</i><br><br><i>In reverence for the sacred, overarching and undergirding all else is a love and respect for Deity. During most of the world's history, mankind has labored much in idolatry, either worshiping false gods or becoming preoccupied with acquiring the material opulence of this world.</i>["Them That Honour Me I Will Honour,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 45]<br><br>Today I do not wish to only address lofty doctrines and principles, although they are essential in providing a clear vision. I want to be practical. I hope to discuss ways in which each of us can elevate our actions, not just our thinking. Indeed, my aspiration is for each of us to want to live a more<i>reverent life--</i>a life reflective of our love for God the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, His Son and our Savior.<br><br>Do not confuse reverence with being quiet. Of course there are times and places when reverence is shown by not speaking or by using hushed tones. Also, in the correct setting and circumstance, being boisterous and reverent are not conflicting. Real reverence is simply not doing anything disrespectful, demeaning, or degrading to the Godhead. It has to do with how we think, how we act, and how we speak. It relates to our integrity and the way we treat one another. The level at which we keep the covenants made in the holy ordinances is a powerful indication of our reverence.<br><br>Spencer W. Kimball, while he was Church president, counseled:<br><br><i>We must remember that reverence is not a somber, temporary behavior that we adopt on Sunday. True reverence involves happiness, as well as love, respect, gratitude, and godly fear. It is a virtue that should be part of our way of life. In fact, Latter-day Saints should be the most reverent people in all the earth.</i>[<i>We Should Be a Reverent People</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1976), 2]<br><br>Those who seek a reverent life have continual and vital opportunities to worship Deity and elevate their reverence. These include public worship, family worship, and personal worship.<br><h2><strong>Public Worship</strong></h2><br>Public worship is when we assemble as children of God, as brothers and sisters, as a community of Saints. These meetings are sometimes large like stake or even general conference or are sometimes small like a quorum or Relief Society meeting or a Sunday School class. Our devotional assembly today is a form of public worship. In each of these meetings we pray, we teach, we testify, and we edify--all with the purpose of increasing our understanding of our Father in Heaven, Jesus the Christ, and the Holy Spirit. We then have the responsibility to translate that ever-increasing knowledge into wisdom--to continually lessen the gap between what we know and how we live.<br><br>Temple worship is a sacred form of public worship because it directly involves ordinances and covenants that connect us with Deity. How connected are you to the temple and your covenants? Are you regularly using this holy form of public worship to strengthen your knowledge and your wisdom? As I have sought to live a reverent life, my prayers have focused more on a desire to live true to my covenants.<br><br>The most important of public worship meetings outside the temple is sacrament meeting. In addition to the worshipful activities that are part of most Church meetings, this service centers on the living ordinance of the sacrament. As we begin and end the meeting and, specifically, in preparation to partake of the holy sacrament, we sing and we pray. Are we full participants? Are our minds and our hearts there or are they somewhere else? Are our smartphones off or do we text and tweet (or, for us older people, email) during the ordinance or during any part of the service? When the speakers speak, especially if they are less polished orators, do we arrogantly disconnect, thinking, "I've heard it all before"?<br><br>If we are guilty of any of these mistakes, what we are doing is reducing--perhaps eliminating--the ability of the Spirit to communicate with us. And then we wonder why we are not edified by sacrament services and other Church meetings.<br><br>Public worship is a magnificent opportunity to develop reverence.<br><h2><strong>Family Worship</strong></h2><br>Public worship should promote family worship. In 1999 the First Presidency counseled parents and children<br><br><i>to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely appointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform.</i>[First Presidency letter, 11 February 1999; cited in "Letter Regarding Parents Teaching Children,"<i>Church News,</i>27 February 1999, 3]<br><br>Of course these same principles have been repeatedly taught by numerous Church leaders in countless ways over many years.<br><br>We live in a world of busyness. Traveling throughout the Church I sometimes privately inquire of local leaders--and these are good Latter-day Saints--"Are you holding family prayer and family home evening?"<br><br>Often I receive an embarrassed look and the explanation "We are so busy. Our children's school and extracurricular activities, music and other lessons, social schedule, and Church functions keep them almost fully occupied. My spouse and I are tied up with work, Church, and other commitments. We are seldom together as a family."<br><br>The spirit of the First Presidency's counsel is that if we are so busy doing good things that we do not have time for the essential things, we must find solutions.<br><br>When children are raised with reverence--when they see parents whose lives are reverent--they are more likely to follow this divine pattern.<br><h2><strong>Personal Worship</strong></h2><br>Ultimately, reverence is a personal matter. Public worship leads us to family worship, which leads us to personal worship. This includes personal prayer, personal gospel study, and personal pondering of one's relationship with Deity. "For how knoweth a man the master . . . who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13).<br><br>Elder D. Todd Christofferson said:<br><br><i>The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this--if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.</i>["A Sense of the Sacred," CES fireside address, 7 November 2004, BYU, Provo]<br><br>Whether it be in public, family, or personal worship or in the mundane affairs of life, it is imperative that we speak the names of Deity only with reverence. The Psalmist David wrote, "He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend [meaning reverent] is his name" (Psalms 111:9). President Boyd K. Packer stated, "Irreverence suits the purposes of the adversary by obstructing the delicate channels of revelation in both mind and spirit" ("Reverence Invites Revelation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, 22).<br><br>In our worship we often use the names of the Father and the Son. Every prayer, every talk, and every lesson ends with "in the name of Jesus Christ, amen." For some the use is perfunctory, given without thought or care. Sometimes we hear the phrase slurred in a mindless way as one hurries to conclude and sit down. I, of course, am not suggesting that this important statement of authority be said in some theatrical show--simply that it is sincerely and clearly expressed with our lips, with our mind, and with our heart. That will bring spiritual power to our supplications and teachings.<br><br>One of the most powerful reverence lessons in my life occurred nearly thirty-five years ago. After completing our studies at BYU, Diane and I moved to Honolulu to begin the next season of our lives. It turned out to be a long season--twenty-seven years. Only a call from a prophet caused us to leave Hawaii.<br><br>The Hawaii Temple--now known as the Laie Hawaii Temple, as there are two temples in Hawaii--was first dedicated by President Heber J. Grant on (appropriately) Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 1919. It was the first temple built outside of Utah, except for the temples in Kirtland and Nauvoo. For nearly six decades it served the Saints in Hawaii and, for much of that time, those throughout the Pacific and Asia. In the mid-1970s there was need for the temple to be closed, enlarged, and renovated. Consequently the temple had need for rededication, which occurred on June 13, 1978.<br><br>Presiding at the rededication was the president of the Church, Spencer W. Kimball. With him were his first and second counselors, N. Eldon Tanner and Marion G. Romney. Also attending were Ezra Taft Benson, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and others of the Twelve and the Seventy. It is not something you would see in the larger Church of today, having that many of the senior Brethren together for an event away from Church headquarters. But that was our blessing in 1978.<br><br>I was a young priesthood leader at the time and was asked by the temple rededication coordinating committee to be responsible for local security and transportation arrangements for President Kimball and his party. I do not want to overstate my responsibilities--they were simply supportive and "behind the scenes." However, what my assignment did allow was proximity to President Kimball. For a weeklong period that included three days of temple rededication sessions, a solemn assembly, and a large regional conference, I observed the president of the Church close-up. I watched him teach, testify, and prophesy with authority and with power. I saw his tireless effort to minister to "the one," asking to meet privately with individuals he noticed in meetings or along the way. I witnessed him continually being used as "an instrument in the hands of God" (Alma 17:9). I was profoundly impressed!<br><br>At the week's conclusion we were at the airport for the departure of President Kimball and his associates. Again, emphasizing my limited and supportive role, I share the following. President Kimball came to me to thank me for my meager efforts. Physically he was not very tall, and I am a large man. He grabbed me by my jacket lapels and sharply yanked me down to be at his height. Then he kissed me on the cheek and thanked me. After walking away a few steps, President Kimball returned. He grasped me in the same way and pulled me down again. This time he kissed me on the other cheek and told me that he loved me. Then he departed.<br><br>The year before, a biography of Spencer W. Kimball had been published, written by his son and his grandson. At that time I had obtained it and read it, and I found it interesting. However, after this very personal experience with Spencer Woolley Kimball, I went home from the airport and pulled that thick volume from our library shelf, feeling an intense desire to read it again. Over the next several days--every waking hour I was not otherwise obligated--I was reading and reflecting. You see, I was now reading about someone whom I deeply loved. I was now reading about someone who I knew loved me. I was now reading about someone for whom I would do anything, because I knew whatever he asked would be for my own best good.<br><br>Through the exhilaration of that experience I had another experience. This one is too personal to share, but through it I felt deeply ashamed. I comprehended that I did not have that same love and respect--reverence--for Those who matter the most: the members of the Godhead and, specifically, God's Only Begotten, the Savior and the Redeemer. This motivated me to study His "biography" and, through prayer and fasting and pondering, to know that I was now reading about someone whom I deeply loved. I was now reading about someone who I knew loved me. I was now reading about someone for whom I would do anything, because I knew whatever He asked would be for my own best good.<br><br>My dear friends, I testify that this knowledge has made all the difference in my life and in our family. I hasten to add that it has not magically made us without blemish and it has not necessarily made life easy. That would be contrary to God's plan. But what it has provided is hope--"a perfect brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31:20). There has never been a thought of giving up, quitting, or retreating. I wish the same for you.<br><br>Even as magnificent as you are, within a congregation of this size there is much joy and much pain. Individually you may deeply feel the weight of life's heavy burdens. Perhaps matters in your family are not as you would wish. Maybe you are struggling with your faith. Possibly you are dealing with something in your past--either something you have done or something that has unfairly been done to you. Some of you may have physical or mental or emotional challenges that seem too much to endure. Whatever your circumstances, living a reverent life will lessen your load. With the message of the oft-sung hymn "I Am a Child of God" in your heart and soul and not simply on your lips, and with a continual reliance on the atoning sacrifice of the Savior Jesus Christ, there can be peace and comfort even in the most difficult of times.<br><br>Today can be a pivotal, even historic day in our lives. It can be the day we make the decision and take the disciplined efforts to become more reverent. For some of us it may be by giving up some addictive habit or repugnant practice that is offending God. For others it may be by reprioritizing our lives and making our love for God supreme. A reverent life is worth any price. Indeed, it is the essence of our life's work. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald L.

<h1>tional: &quot;Recognizing and Responding to the Promptings of the...&quot; by Gordon E. Limb</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the social work main office in the Joseph F. Smith Building there is a disability access door that has a self-charging mechanism that opens and closes the door. We've had this mechanism on the door for over two years. My office is located next to that door, so I am very aware of every time the door opens and closes. However, it was only very recently that, as I was sitting at my desk in a quiet, thoughtful moment, I heard the door open, and as it closed I heard a unique melodic sound. I was so taken aback that I got up from my desk, walked out of my office, opened the door, and listened again to the melodic tone as it closed. I asked myself, Why hadn't I heard that melody before? Was this the first time that the melodic sound had occurred? My guess is that the door has been making that sound since it was first installed, yet it took me over two years to recognize and respond to that small, soft, melodic sound. It wasn't until I was in tune with the sound that I actually heard it.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, in my work at BYU and in my service within the Church, I have been blessed to spend much of my time working with youth and young adults. As important topics and decisions come up during what Elder Robert D. Hales called the "decade of decision" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/to-the-aaronic-priesthood-preparing-for-the-decade-of-decision?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To the Aaronic Priesthood: Preparing for the Decade of Decision</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2007, 48), I often hear questions such as How can I recognize and respond to the promptings of the Spirit? and, more specifically, as stated by Elder David A. Bednar, How can I tell the difference between my emotions telling me what I want to hear and the Holy Ghost telling me what I need to hear? In fact, while he was president of BYU–Idaho, Elder Bednar said that this last question was the question most frequently asked by the students with whom he met. He said, "During the entire time we have been holding family home evenings with students, I cannot remember a single time when some version of this question was not asked" ("Receiving, Recognizing, and Responding to the Promptings of the Holy Ghost," Ricks College devotional address, 31 August 1999).<br><br>I am guessing many of you, like me, have asked this question. How can we tell if we are receiving inspiration from the Spirit or if we are getting a message from our own emotions or from an evil source or if we are receiving any spiritual prompting at all? While I don't have a complete or easy answer to these questions, I would like to discuss with you some of the things I have learned about recognizing and responding to the promptings of the Spirit. I pray for and invite the Holy Ghost to be with each of us today as we discuss this most important topic. Let's begin by discussing how the Lord communicates with us.<br><h2><b>How the Lord Communicates with Us</b></h2><br>When we communicate with Heavenly Father, we do so through prayer. When He speaks to us, He does so through revelation. This two-way divine communication is critical to our understanding of the process of receiving personal revelation (see L. Lionel Kendrick, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/l-lionel-kendrick_personal-revelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Revelation</a>," BYU devotional address, 20 May 1997).<br><br>Let's look at this process in action. In sections 6 and 8 of the Doctrine and Covenants, through revelation given to Oliver Cowdery, we learn some important concepts of this two-way divine communication. In Doctrine and Covenants 6:15 the Lord said, "Thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind . . . that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth." Then, in verse 23, the Lord said: "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" Here we see that after Oliver inquired of the Lord through prayer, his mind was enlightened by the Spirit and he was given a feeling of calmness or peace. In Doctrine and Covenants 8:2 the Lord states, "Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart."<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott noted, "When we receive an impression in our<i>heart,</i>we can use our<i>mind</i>either to rationalize it away or to accomplish it" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/10/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning to Recognize Answers to Prayer</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, 31; emphasis in original). Together the verses in these two sections teach us that when Heavenly Father speaks to us through the Spirit<i>in its most familiar form,</i>it most often comes to us through our thoughts and feelings. As President Boyd K. Packer noted:<br><br><i>That sweet, quiet voice of inspiration comes more as a feeling than it does as a sound. . . . The Holy Ghost communicates with our spirits through the mind more than through the physical senses. This guidance comes as thoughts, as feelings through promptings and impressions. We may<b>feel</b>the words of spiritual communication more than<b>hear</b>them and<b>see</b>with spiritual rather than with mortal eyes.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/prayer-and-promptings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prayer and Promptings</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 44; emphasis in original]<br><br>Therefore, it shouldn't be difficult for us to understand why we are counseled by our Church leaders to avoid anything that negatively impacts our ability to receive promptings through our thoughts and feelings (see Bednar, "Receiving").<br><br>In the field of social work we often work with people who are struggling with addictions, including pornography and other addictive substances and behaviors. These types of addictions negatively impact "our ability to recognize and respond to the promptings of the Holy Ghost" (Bednar, "Receiving"). Brothers and sisters, what are the influences in your life and mine that negatively impact our ability to feel the Spirit? What are ways we can better understand the Lord's pattern of communicating with us?<br><h2><b>Making Faulty Assumptions</b></h2><br>All too often we make faulty assumptions and have erroneous expectations regarding recognizing the Spirit. Let me share with you what Elder Bednar said about this:<br><br><i>Let me suggest that many of us typically assume we will receive</i><em><strong>an</strong></em><i>answer or<strong>a</strong>prompting to our earnest prayers and pleadings. And we also frequently expect that such<b>an</b>answer or <strong>a</strong>prompting will come immediately and<strong>all at once.</strong>Thus we tend to believe the Lord will give us<b>a big answer quickly and all at one time.</b>However, the pattern repeatedly described in the scriptures suggests we receive "line upon line, precept upon precept," or, in other words,<strong>many small answers over a period of time.</strong>Recognizing and understanding this pattern is an important key to obtaining inspiration and help from the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>Elder Bednar then went on to state:<br><br><i>Sister Bednar and I frequently visit with students who wonder about career choices and how to properly select a school at which to study and receive additional education. Many times a student is perplexed--having felt as though "the" answer about a career or a school was received at one particular point in time, only to feel that a different and perhaps conflicting answer was received at another point in time. The question then is often asked, "Why did the Lord give me two different answers?" In like manner, a student may sincerely seek to know if the person he or she has been dating is "the one." A feeling of "yes" at one time may appear to be contradicted by a different feeling of "no" at another time. May I simply suggest that what we initially believe is "the" answer may be but one part of a "line upon line, precept upon precept," ongoing, incremental, and unfolding pattern of small answers. It is clearly the case that the Lord did not change His mind; rather, you and I must learn to better recognize the Lord's pattern as a series of related and expanding answers to our most important questions.</i>["'Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept' (2 Nephi 28:30)," BYU–Idaho devotional address, 11 September 2001; emphasis in original]<br><br>Let me share two personal examples that illustrate Elder Bednar's points.<br><br>Back in 2000, when I was getting ready to graduate with my doctorate and interviewing for my first faculty position, I found what I thought was the perfect job: a good school fairly close to home, a creative joint faculty position within the school, and a very prominent company that does great work with American Indian children and families--my specialty. My meeting with the company went great. They were onboard, and I thought this appointment would lead to all kinds of research opportunities and funding. In my mind this job was made for me. I prayed, felt good about it, and was moving forward. Then, during my faculty visit to the school, things went from bad to worse. My presentation didn't go well, the faculty members didn't seem to like me, and there was just something that was not right. Well, I didn't get the offer. So why is it that after praying and feeling good about this job, things didn't work out? That was a question my wife and I were asking ourselves.<br><br>When this job didn't work out, the other opportunity I had was to go to Washington University in St. Louis to the top social work program in the country, which obviously is a good thing. Their offer was for me to be the assistant director of the Kathryn M. Buder Center for American Indian Studies and a lecturer in the School of Social Work. Although this was a great opportunity, it was not a tenure-track position--something I definitely wanted. So we prayed again, moved forward, and took the job. What a blessing that position turned out to be! I got to spend three years working with Eddie Brown, the director of the Buder Center and former assistant secretary of the interior in charge of the Bureau of Indian Affairs--an appointment our own Larry Echo Hawk later filled. Eddie Brown is probably the most influential American Indian social worker in the country, and during those three years we were able to travel throughout the country working with Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Those three years provided me with the foundation I needed in order to be where I am today.<br><br>As a sidenote, I later found out that, shortly after 9/11, when the economy took a nosedive, the first position was canceled due to lack of funding from the company for the joint appointment. While it would have started out as a great job, it would have been short lived.<br><br>Here is the lesson I learned in recognizing and responding to the promptings of the Spirit: Sometimes what we perceive to be a positive answer followed by a negative outcome is later followed by a new, unexpected, better answer (i.e., opportunity) if we will but trust in the Lord and keep moving forward. The Lord knew what I did not. That first experience prepared me to listen more closely to the Spirit the next time, to have an increased level of gratitude for how the Lord works in our lives, and to remember "that all things work together for good [in the Lord's time frame] to them that love God" (Romans 8:28). So, in summary, sometimes the right choices or blessings come in the Lord's time and through promptings that are often not recognized until after they are acted upon.<br><br>Example two: My wife, Erika, and I dated for nearly a year before we were married. I don't ever recall receiving a one-time spiritual confirmation that she was "the one." However, the more we interacted, the more we talked, and the more we learned about each other in different situations, I received many small, simple, and quiet promptings that she was a special, talented, spiritual woman. Together, all of those simple answers over a period of time helped me to receive an appropriate spiritual confirmation that I should ask her to marry me. That confirmation did not come all at once during a single heartfelt prayer of desperation. Rather, it came more in a line-upon-line and precept-upon-precept manner (see Bednar, "Line upon Line").<br><br>Here is another key element regarding finding a spouse. Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated:<br><br><i>If a revelation is outside the limits of stewardship, you know it is not from the Lord, and you are not bound by it. I have heard of cases where a young man told a young woman she should marry him because he had received a revelation that she was to be his eternal companion. If this is a true revelation, it will be confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know. In the meantime, she is under no obligation to heed it. . . . The man can receive revelation to guide his own actions, but he cannot properly receive revelation to direct hers. She is outside his stewardship.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_revelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revelation</a>," BYU devotional address, 29 September 1981]<br><br>Just because I received a witness to marry my wife, that was not enough. She also had to receive her witness--independently. I think it took her a little longer to know whether or not she wanted to spend the rest of eternity with this guy who was pretty average.<br><br>Now, your experiences or others' experiences with important decisions may be different. We all know that big answers do come--and sometimes all at once--but those are more the exception than the rule. For our family, the story of the lost binoculars and how my daughter, McKenna, prayed and knew almost instantly where to find them has become legendary and is used as an example of a big answer to a single prayer. However, "we should not feel spiritually inadequate or unqualified if we do not receive a big and immediate answer to a request or plea for help the first time we ask" (Bednar, "Line upon Line").<br><br>As we think about things we can do to increase our capacity to follow the Spirit, let me suggest a few ways I have found to better receive and respond to the promptings of the Spirit.<br><h2><strong>Ways to Increase Our Capacity to Receive and Respond to the Promptings of the Spirit</strong></h2><br>First, living worthily invites the constant companionship of the Spirit. If you are not now worthy, repent and become worthy. For those who are endowed, go to the temple--the Lord's classroom--and keep your covenants. I've heard students ask, "How can I tell if this is the Spirit I'm feeling?" If you are living worthily, Paul's letter to the Galatians tells us that the fruits of the Spirit are "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" (Galatians 5:22–23). These are all examples of what we feel when the Spirit is present.<br><br>In striving to live worthily I am also encouraged by the discussion in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants about the gifts of the Spirit. Verse 9 states that "they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep<i>all</i>my commandments" (emphasis added). Well, I love the Lord, but I don't always keep<i>all</i>of the commandments. The last part of this verse adds an additional element of hope: "and him that seeketh so to do." I am thankful that as I make mistakes and neglect to heed promptings but "seeketh so to" keep the commandments, a loving Father in Heaven and Savior are always there to help me get back on course if I will but keep repenting and keep trying.<br><br>One night recently my seven-year-old son was having a hard time and was misbehaving, so I sent him to bed a little early. My two boys share the same room, and I usually read to them before bed. That night as I went down to read to them, I was in a hurry to finish a talk I had coming up in my Church assignment--as well as being a little frustrated with my son's behavior. So I hurriedly read to them and, before leaving, gave my son one more short lecture on proper behavior. During that time I felt something--a feeling--that I should stop and give him a hug and tell him that I loved him. But in my haste and frustration I ignored the prompting, finished reading, and hurried back upstairs to finish my talk. That was a missed opportunity I regret.<br><br>Thankfully for me, Heavenly Father is patient--perfectly patient--and was patient with me on that occasion. The next morning, as I was lying in bed getting ready to get up and start the day, I felt that same prompting: give your son a hug and tell him that you love him. This time I followed the prompting. When my son awoke, I called to him and asked if he could come to my room. When he did, I asked him to sit down on my bed.<br><br>He did so and looked at me and asked, "What?" like he was expecting to get another lecture like the night before.<br><br>I said, "Hayden, I sure love you and am grateful that you are my son." I then gave him a big hug. He got up and left, and a few minutes later I could hear my son in his happy element, making siren sounds while playing with Legos. The experience was nothing spectacular, but it was a tender mercy, and I am thankful for a second prompting from the Spirit to do what I should have done the night before.<br><br>Second, sincere prayer invites the constant companionship of the Spirit. President Gordon B. Hinckley observed:<br><br><i>The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries--we place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>469]<br><br>Another key element in sincere prayer is gratitude. When was the last time you said a prayer and only expressed gratitude? About learning to recognize answers to prayer, Elder Richard G. Scott said:<br><br><i>I have saved the most important part about prayer until the end. It is gratitude! Our sincere efforts to thank our beloved Father generate wondrous feelings of peace, self-worth, and love. No matter how challenging our circumstances, honest appreciation fills our mind to overflowing with gratitude.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/10/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning to Recognize Answers</a>," 32]<br><br>Obviously there are times we need to ask for help and guidance, but I know I can spend more time giving thanks in my prayers.<br><br>Third, immersing ourselves in the scriptures invites the constant companionship of the Spirit. "Studying the scriptures trains us to hear the Lord's voice" and recognize His Spirit (David M. McConkie, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/10/gospel-learning-and-teaching?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gospel Learning and Teaching</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2010, 15). Scriptural immersion provides us with a unique insight into how others have received and responded to the promptings of the Spirit. Elder Bednar gave a great CES fireside talk entitled "A Reservoir of Living Water" (4 February 2007)--that I highly encourage you to read or reread--in which he talked about feasting on the word by<i>searching</i>the scriptures for connections, patterns, and themes. In our Church callings we have a handbook of instructions that tells us how to fulfill our callings. In living the gospel, our handbooks of instruction are the scriptures and the revealed word of God through His prophets.<br><br>Fourth, service invites the constant companionship of the Spirit. Do you realize that as others are seeking the Spirit to receive answers to their prayers, often the Lord uses us to answer those prayers? We had a Relief Society president in my ward who would often pray and ask, "Father, help me to be an answer to someone else's prayer today." Then, as she was going into work or coming home, she would drive around the ward enlisting the Spirit's prompting to determine if there was a sister who needed her help. Numerous times as she was driving by a sister's home or thinking of a particular sister, the Spirit would prompt her to stop by, bring dinner, or ask to watch the sister's children. That Relief Society president knew what it meant to follow the promptings of the Spirit and be an answer to someone else's prayer. That is Christlike service.<br><br>Finally, taking time to pause, ponder, and listen invites the constant companionship of the Spirit (see Caryn Esplin, "Recognizing and Increasing Personal Revelation," BYU–Idaho devotional address, 31 July 2012). In our fast-paced, immediate-gratification world we can become so preoccupied with good things that we neglect the most important things. I have found that early in the morning, when things are quiet and my mind is focused, I am most receptive to the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>There is a famous social science experiment (see Daniel J. Simons and Christopher F. Chabris, "Gorillas in Our Midst: Sustained Inattentional Blindness for Dynamic Events,"<i>Perception</i>28, no. 9 [1999]: 1059–74) in which participants are asked to watch a video of players in white and black passing a basketball and to count the number of passes the white team makes. However, during the middle of the experiment, as participants are counting the passes, a person in a gorilla suit walks between the players and off the other side of the screen. At the end the narrator asks how many passes the white team made. The narrator then asks, "But did you see the gorilla?"<br><br>This experiment has been done on a number of occasions, and typically about half of the participants are so focused on counting the number of passes that they do not see the obvious gorilla walking through the players. I have to admit that the first time I saw the video I did not see the gorilla. Brothers and sisters, are we so focused and so busy that we neglect the promptings of the Spirit--even when those promptings appear right in front of us like the gorilla? Or, when the promptings do come, can we tell the difference between the Spirit's promptings and our emotions?<br><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><br>There is a line from the musical<i>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</i>after Joseph has been sold into Egypt and put in prison. While Joseph is feeling down and hopeless, the narrator sings:<br><br><i>Hang on now Joseph, you'll make it some day.</i><br><i>Don't give up Joseph, fight till you drop.</i><br><i>We've read the book and you come out on top.</i><br>["Go Go Go Joseph" (London: The Really Useful Group, 1991)]<br><br>Similarly, our Heavenly Father has a plan for us--a perfect plan of happiness--and I testify that as we learn to better recognize and respond to the promptings of the Spirit, we will find answers to our prayers and have increased capacity to know how and whether those promptings are from the Holy Ghost--especially during this "decade of decision" for many of you. Just like the door leading into the social work office, I further testify that as we learn and understand the Lord's pattern for communicating with us, those small, melodic tones of the Spirit will<br><br>[lead]<i>us back into his sight,</i><br><i>Where we may stay</i><br><i>To share eternal life.</i><br>["Our Savior's Love,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 113]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon E. Limb was director of the BYU School of Social Work when this devotional address was given on 5 March 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>tional: &quot;The Covenant Path: God&#039;s Plan for Me&quot; by Rosemary M. Wixom</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored by the opportunity to speak to you today. I love to come to the BYU campus. I stand before you as "true blue." As it has already been said, my shade of blue was painted in Cache Valley at Utah State University. My husband's blue has a reddish tint and our children's blues are of various hues. Yet when we see the color blue--any blue--we cheer.<br><br>There is something very stimulating about a university campus. Where there is a learning atmosphere there is energy, and increasing your knowledge is progressive. You are advancing on the path of life.<br><br>Now you may be puzzled at today's devotional and may be asking, "What does the Primary general president have to say to me?" After all, many of you graduated from Primary years ago and have "put away [those] childish things."<sup>1</sup>Yet the messages and principles of the songs you sang in Primary still apply today and hopefully have remained in your heart.<br><br>Today we sang "I Will Follow God's Plan." We sang the words "My life is a gift; my life has a plan. My life has a purpose; in heav'n it began."<sup>2</sup><br><br>As a student on this campus you are progressing with your plan. You have a purpose in mind. Can you see the Lord's hand in your life? Can you see the path you took to get here?<br><br>I was born in Ogden, Utah, and grew up in Salt Lake City. At age eighteen, when I was about to leave to go to Utah State, my goals were simple. I really had just two. I'm going to be honest with you and tell you what they were: (1) I wanted to be an elementary school teacher, and (2) I wanted to fall in love. Now that seems simple, but I really did not think beyond those two goals. I hoped that somewhere out there was a handsome young man who also had the goal to stay on the path, get an education, and fall in love so we could marry, have a family, and bring children into this world. But I was anxious and nervous inside. What if my plan did not unfold<i>how</i>I wanted it to and<i>when</i>I wanted it to?<br><br>I was looking at the path through a magnifying glass, and all I could see were my shoelaces. I remembered those lessons in Primary about the plan of salvation. I could see the circles and the arrows on the chart, but I could not yet visualize myself in the plan. I wish I would have had the words to the chorus of this Primary song then. They read:<br><br><i>I will follow God's plan for me,</i><br><i>Holding fast to his word and his love.</i><br><i>I will work, and I will pray;</i><br><i>I will always walk in his way.</i><br><i>Then I will be happy on earth</i><br><i>And in my home above.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>That is the key, and it is really quite simple: "I will follow<i>God's plan</i>for me." And we do it by holding fast to His word, with His love, and through our prayers to Him while simply living life.<br><br>Brigham Young said, "Live so that the spirit of our religion [lives] within us."<sup>4</sup>We are a making-and-keeping-covenants people, and nothing better shapes us than the sacred covenants we make to the Lord. We live these covenants when we follow His plan, and we come to know who we really are.<br><br>George Bernard Shaw said: "Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself."<sup>5</sup><br><br>That is true. I think of it this way: There are those who see themselves on this earth as simply growing up--helpless in a way. They eat, they sleep, and they live their lives. They watch themselves get taller and older. They let the world mold them and allow their circumstances to dictate their future. It is as if they are watching the wind swirl around a block of sandstone. The years go by until, finally, one day a shape is created. Or we can decide the kind of person we want to become, grip the chisel, and go to work. The sculpture being created is now of our creation. At times we may even stand back in awe at the form it is taking. The pinnacle of our reality is when we come to know we are not alone in our work. The real Artist is standing at our side, and His vision for this exquisite piece is beyond our comprehension.<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said:<br><br><i>We see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today. Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever. Although we might settle for less, Heavenly Father won't, for He sees us as the glorious beings we are capable of becoming.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>It is as if the Lord has given us tools with which to create this "being." These tools are the covenants we make and keep, beginning with the baptismal covenant.<br><br>A covenant is personal. It is so personal that it is given to us individually, and often our very own name is said in conjunction with the ordinance that accompanies the covenant. By living our covenants with the Lord's help, He sculpts us into a masterpiece.<br><br>Think of the baptismal covenant. Lately I have viewed the covenant of baptism through a granddaughter's eyes. Lucy Catherine is three years old. In her world she is a princess. She is beginning this earthly path. I think she takes after her grandmother. Lucy is my buddy. She loves to climb up into my lap, and together we watch the Bible videos on my iPad. She can operate the iPad all by herself. Her favorite Bible video is of Jesus being baptized in the River Jordan.<br><br>Lucy is only three years old, but she feels something when she watches Jesus being baptized, and so do I.<br><br>Elder Robert D. Hales said: "Many members of the Church do not fully understand what happened when they went into the waters of baptism." He then asked:<br><br><i>Do</i>[we]<i>understand . . . that when</i>[we were]<i>baptized</i>[we were]<i>changed forever? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Our baptism and confirmation is the gateway<b>into</b>His kingdom. When we enter, we covenant to be<b>of</b>His kingdom--forever!</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>We see powerful evidences of the magnitude of the baptismal covenant in the history of the Church. In Liverpool, England, in the 1840s, George Cannon and his wife, Ann Quayle Cannon, were converted to the gospel. George wrote in a letter to his sister:<br><br><i>I was sincerely desirous to lead a new life . . . ; and though slow of belief at first, and not seeing the necessity of baptism, yet God in His infinite mercy opened my eyes.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>With the covenant of baptism and the promise of more covenants came the desire to join the Saints in America at all costs. Ann tucked a little money away each month so the family would have the funds necessary for the voyage.<br><br><i>The wish to get to Zion became . . . a consuming desire. . . . She began to count the days that must elapse before the ship's sailing. She was impressed that if this season . . . should pass and find the family still in England, she would not be alive to urge the journey another year. . . . She had a sure premonition that she should not live to reach the shores of America, and told her husband so.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Ann was expecting their seventh child at the time, and George tried to persuade her to wait.<br><br>[But]<i>she refused absolutely--she would rather die in trying to go than live</i>[by]<i>remaining. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Both</i>[George and Ann]<i>prayed . . . that God's blessing would attend them in doing what they believed to be His will.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>On September 17, 1842, George, Ann, and their six children boarded the ship and set sail for America. George later wrote:<br><br><i>We are now launched on the bosom of the mighty deep, and sea-sickness has made the passengers for the most part very ill. My dear Ann is dreadfully affected with this nauseous sickness. . . . Yet I have never heard one complaint from her on her own account.</i>[She]<i>regret</i>[s]<i>. . . not being able to assist me in the care of the children.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>The days and weeks went by, and Ann only worsened. On October 28 she passed away. George wrote, "O God, how mysterious are Thy ways! Teach me resignation to Thy will!"<sup>12</sup><br><br>Both George and Ann Quayle Cannon understood the promise "The Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm . . . in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel."<sup>13</sup>George and Ann Cannon lived their lives keeping their covenant of baptism and looking to the promise of more covenants while carving out a future for their posterity.<br><br>What did they clearly understand about the covenant of baptism? What was it that drove George and Ann to come to America at all costs? They were simply doing what they believed to be the Lord's will.<br><br>Today we are not asked to move to Salt Lake City after our baptism. But we do enter into sacred covenants with God, and we promise to do three things:<br><br>• Take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ<br>• Keep His commandments<br>• Always remember Him<br><br>How can we take upon ourselves the name of Christ today?We do more than represent Him and follow Him: "We . . . see ourselves as His. We . . . put Him [and His work] first in our lives. We [seek] what He wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want."<sup>14</sup><br><br>How can we live that baptismal promise in our daily lives here as students at BYU? It is a process, and oftentimes we wrestle to align our lives with the Father's will. At times we may even question our judgment. We may rationalize our actions and say, "But others are doing it." The choices we make follow us into our classrooms, in our conversations, with our callings, and on our dates. The results may alter how we dress, our appearance, what we text, the movies we see, and our very thoughts. When we seek His will, He will magnify our every effort to stay on the path back to Him. We need not ever feel alone. Be patient with yourself as you learn this process.<br><br>Our prayers may become different, and we may find ourselves asking, "What would Thou have me do?" and "Help me know what is Thy will." We find ourselves stepping out of the boat, so to speak, to do His will. We prepare spiritually each day with personal prayers to Him, we read His words in the scriptures, and then we trust that He will guide us. His will then becomes ours.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar said:<br><br><i>You exercised your moral agency to accept the conditions of the baptismal covenant. . . . And as a representative of Jesus Christ, your life is no longer just about what you want but what God wants for you.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Missionaries all over the world literally take upon themselves the name of Christ when they put on that missionary badge. We witnessed prophetic revelation last October 6 when President Thomas S. Monson announced the missionary age changes.<sup>16</sup>The response has been astounding. We are witnessing a modern-day miracle in these latter days.<br><br>Many of you have experienced a mission, and you know what it is like. It is not easy. When I served my first mission with my husband, in my first sentence in my first letter home to both our children and my parents, who had also served, I asked, "Why didn't you tell me a mission was this hard?" When it becomes impossible to carry on, it is that covenant to do the Lord's will that causes a missionary to find a private place and get on his or her knees. His or her prayer may be "I cannot do this alone. Only with Thee can I continue; only with Thee can I learn another language; and only with Thee can I teach those older, wiser, and more articulate than I." A mission changes our life for the better because we take upon us His name.<br><br><b>When we are baptized we covenant to keep His commandments.</b>This commitment to come into God's kingdom separates--but, as Elder Robert D. Hales notes, does not isolate<sup>17</sup>--us from the world as we "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places."<sup>18</sup>To stand as a witness includes everything we do and say.<br><br>In living the baptismal covenant we look for ways to keep the commandments rather than look for ways around them.<br><br>While I was visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina, I met Marianela, a frail, beautiful mother with two children, ages nine and twelve. All three had been baptized. Marianela was dealing with severe rheumatoid arthritis. She could only stand or lie down; she could not sit. At home she taught her children with what resources she had. She used both the scriptures and the Relief Society manual. I noticed those two books stacked neatly on her table. She wanted her children to keep the commandments and participate on Sunday and partake of the sacrament, so she accepted the invitation from the bishop's wife to pick them up weekly. Marianela would ride to church lying down in the backseat of the car. It was her way of practicing obedience and aligning her heart with His. In Primary we sing the words "Keep the commandments! In this there is safety; in this there is peace."<sup>19</sup>There was peace in Marianela's home.<br><br>I saw another example of keeping the commandments in the Ilagan Stake in the Philippines. Just before a meeting I watched a large truck pull up to the chapel entrance. I could see the arms of the members reaching through the slats on the side of the truck to wave to others in the parking lot. The truck was covered with a canvas top. Out jumped numerous happy Filipinos--the men in their white shirts and ties and the women in their dresses. I learned they had ridden for hours to get there, bouncing on the wooden benches inside the truck. We all hurried into the building and sat down. I thought of their sacrifice to be there--and then the tears streamed down my face as they sang the opening song. With smiles they sang "Because I Have Been Given Much."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Part of keeping the commandments is serving the Lord. President Lugo, the president of the Ilagan Stake, is a tiny little man with great faith. He has the image of the Savior in his countenance. I learned that he had been in a serious cycle accident and had been in the hospital. It was nearing the time in their stake for their yearly trip to the temple to do baptisms for the dead. He was devastated at the thought of not going with the youth, but he could not walk.<br><br>His wife said, "You cannot go. If you go, the youth would have to carry you, and that would be asking too much."<br><br>President Lugo said, "If they will carry me into the temple, I will walk out."<br><br>And that is exactly what he did. How can we possibly draw limits on our service to the Lord?<br><br><b>As we keep our covenant to always remember the Lord, He will help us follow His plan. </b>Let's be honest: While trying to live our covenants, we sometimes get discouraged. We may see nothing but our imperfections. We may think our mistakes are impossible to repair, and we may think we cannot change. We may feel like we are failing.<br><br>As we chisel in the sandstone to create this new self, we sometimes chip off huge chunks of stone. Doing this may appear to disfigure our ultimate goal. Like Nephi, we may say, "O wretched man [or woman] that I am!"<sup>21</sup>We may lose hope, and we may fear that there is no way to repair our mistakes. But the real Artist, Jesus Christ, patiently and lovingly stands by our side and waits for us to ask for His help. He is ready to heal us. Then, like Nephi, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, we may ask:<br><br><i>Wilt thou redeem my soul? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Wilt thou encircle me . . . in the robe of thy righteousness! . . . Wilt thou make my path straight before me! . . .</i><br><br><i>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>One real blessing is that this Sunday we will again have the opportunity to renew the covenant we made at baptism as we partake of the sacrament with the glorious promise that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.<br><br>No wonder that when Romans 6 refers to baptism the scripture reads, "Walk in newness of life."<sup>23</sup>That newness of life is the Atonement working within us, and we can experience it weekly. The Artist, Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer. "He was foreordained to carry out the Atonement--to come to the earth, suffer the penalty for our sins, die on the cross, and be resurrected."<sup>24</sup>He will not halt the sculpturing process or put down the chisel until we are perfect and living in His presence. The Atonement is the supreme expression of the Savior's love for the Father and for us.<sup>25</sup><br><br>The sculptor Michelangelo, "when asked how he had produced the magnificent statue of an angel, . . . is reported to have simply replied, 'I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.'"<sup>26</sup><br><br>And so it is with the mutual efforts of a loving Savior and a covenant-keeping disciple on the path. The angel is within each one of us. Let us live the covenant we have made at baptism and seek to do His will. We will watch the plan He has masterfully created for each one of us take shape. Regardless of its form, we will stand in awe as the angel emerges, and we will give credit to our Savior Jesus Christ, for He is the perfect Artist.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rosemary M.

<h1>tional Address: &quot;The Joy of Education and Lifelong Learning&quot; by James D. Gordon III</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am happy to be here with you today. I remember when I was a university student. Like some of you, I had trouble deciding what my major should be. First I thought about majoring in economics. That way, if I couldn't get a job after I graduated, at least I would understand why.<br><br>Then I thought I might major in physical education. I went down to the gym to lift weights, but the laughter made it difficult to concentrate.<br><br>I sampled some classes, but I didn't always do very well. For example, I took a photography class. I just about went crazy trying to take a close-up of the horizon. The teacher in that class gave me an F minus. He said that giving me an F would be unfair to the people who failed normally.<br><br>I studied chemistry, but I thought that there were only four elements on the periodic table: earth, air, fire, and water. I thought that fire had three electrons in the outer shell.<br><br>I thought about studying math. It has been reported that 60 percent of Americans cannot do basic math. Sixty percent! That's nearly half! But we shouldn't laugh--and most of you didn't, and I appreciate that.<br><h2><strong>Seek Learning</strong></h2><br>Seriously, I would like to speak about the joy of education and lifelong learning. Life is a test, and life is also a school. The Lord has invited us to seek learning. He said, "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>2</sup>He commanded early Church leaders to "study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Three reasons why we should learn are to develop personally, to increase our ability to serve others, and to be prepared in all things. Brigham Young said, "Our education should be such as to improve our minds and fit us for increased usefulness; to make us of greater service to the human family."<sup>4</sup><br><br>President Thomas S. Monson taught:<br><br><i>Your talents will expand as you study and learn. You will be able to better assist your families in their learning, and you will have peace of mind in knowing that you have prepared yourself for the eventualities that you may encounter in life.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Learning helps us to be prepared in all things. The Lord said:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Being prepared in all things includes being prepared for the world of work so that you can provide for yourself and your family.<br><br>It is a great privilege to study at Brigham Young University. You have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is consistent with the principles of the gospel. Being a student here is a position of trust. As you know, the Church pays for much of your education. You have the responsibility to study hard, to obey the Honor Code, and to prepare for future service. Hopefully throughout your life you will look back on your time here with fondness and cherish the memories.<br><h2><strong>On Pursuing a BYU Education</strong></h2><br>I would like to offer some advice as you pursue your education here. I hope that I don't sound like Polonius giving advice to Laertes in Shakespeare's play<i>Hamlet--</i>especially when I remember what happened to Polonius. I am not referring to the fact that he was killed behind the arras, but rather to the fact that over the centuries he has been portrayed by literally thousands of bad actors.<br><br>First, do your best in school. You might recall a story about a person who was asked to build a house. He decided to cut corners, use cheap materials, and do a poor job. When he was done, the owner handed him the key and said, "I'd like to give you this house as a gift."<br><br>Attending the university is like that. You can work hard and do a good job, or you can cut cor-ners and do a poor job. Be fair with yourself by giving your best effort. I encourage you to work diligently, to learn a lot, and to prepare well for the future.<br><br>Second, do things to enrich your education, such as having a mentored-learning experience with a faculty member, publishing an article, doing an internship, working in BYUSA, or participating in a student club. Perhaps you can be a teaching assistant or a research assistant or participate in a performing group. BYU offers so many opportunities to develop and grow. When you look back on your education here, these extra activities will have special meaning.<br><br>You might participate in intramural sports. Personally, I'm not very athletic. I tell my students that I played football in high school. They had a play designed especially for me. It was called "Pencilneck Right." You know how BYU uses the run to set up the pass? Well, Pencilneck Right was used to set up the injury timeout.<br><br>When I was in high school I was in the chess club. I tell my students that I had a rook on my letterman jacket. Do you know what it says when you walk around campus with a rook on your letterman jacket? "Don't mess with me, pal. Checkmate!"<br><br>Third, give service. It is important to fulfill Church callings and to perform other service. Y-Serve, the Center for Service and Learning, located in the Wilkinson Student Center, offers many opportunities to serve in the community. Service is important for its own sake, and it helps you to keep a broader perspective and to stay balanced.<br><br>Fourth, make friends. Even though your classmates are not as good-looking--and not as humble--as you are, they are bright, good, and interesting people. The friendships you make here can last throughout your whole life and can be a particularly sweet aspect of your university experience. Take time to make friends.<br><br>When I was in high school I didn't have many friends. Once I told my dad that the other kids were giving me a hard time about my religion. My father sat down next to me, and, in his fatherly way, he said, "Son, it doesn't matter what race you are or what religion you are. There will always be people who don't like you--because you're irritating."<br><br>Fifth, attend devotional and forum addresses and other events, such as academic presentations, concerts, plays, and art exhibits. These are wonderful opportunities.<br><br>Sixth, enjoy your university education. It's exciting, fascinating, challenging, and fun. The secret to happiness is not to look forward to some future time when all your problems will be solved. The secret is to be happy today.<br><h2><strong>The Joy and Sweetness of Lifelong Learning</strong></h2><br>There is joy in learning. In some Hebrew schools a special ceremony occurs on the first day of class. The teacher places a drop of honey on the cover of a book and gives the book to the student, who licks the honey off. The symbolic message is that learning is sweet.<br><br>Learning can also be challenging. Sometimes the learning curve is steep. When we are acquiring new knowledge or skills, we may feel uncertain, and we may make mistakes. However, being stretched means that we are growing. If we ask Heavenly Father in prayer, He will increase our ability to learn and help us to overcome our challenges.<br><br>Hopefully your university education will provide a foundation for lifelong learning. As<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>describes:<br><br><i>BYU should inspire students to keep alive their curiosity and prepare them to continue learning throughout their lives. BYU should produce careful readers, prayerful thinkers, and active participants in solving family, professional, religious, and social problems. . . . Thus a BYU diploma is a beginning, not an end, pointing the way to a habit of constant learning. In an era of rapid changes in technology and information, the knowledge and skills learned this year may require renewal the next. Therefore, a BYU degree should educate students in how to learn, teach them that there is much still to learn, and implant in them a love of learning "by study and also by faith."</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The most important area of lifelong learning is spiritual learning. We seek answers through prayer. We read the scriptures regularly so that they become part of our lives. Reading the scriptures reminds us of the Lord's commandments, the covenants that we have made to keep them, and the blessings of the gospel. Studying the scriptures also invites the Holy Ghost, who guides our decisions and helps us to learn. Elder Russell M. Nelson said: "Faith is nurtured through knowledge of God. It comes from prayer and feasting upon the words of Christ through diligent study of the scriptures."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Regardless of one's opportunities for formal education, a person can engage in lifelong learning. My grandfather was Jim Gordon. His parents were Scottish immigrants. He was only able to finish the eighth grade before he went to work. He drove a delivery wagon in San Francisco when he was a young man.<br><br>Automobiles replaced horse-drawn wagons. Later my grandfather became a mechanic. He brought books about diesel engines home from work, and he read them. Eventually he became the supervisor over all the diesel equipment for a substantial company. Although his opportunity for formal education was limited, he kept learning on his own. His most important learning experiences occurred when, later in life, he decided to enter the waters of baptism and to receive the blessings of the temple.<br><br>When my grandfather was young, he drove a horse-drawn wagon. However, his world changed. During his lifetime he flew in passenger planes, and astronauts landed on the moon. Your world will change too. Many of the changes will be positive and exciting; others may present challenges. Will you be prepared to meet the challenges that will arise during your lifetime?<br><br>We need to continue to learn throughout our lives. President Gordon B. Hinckley told graduating BYU students:<br><br><i>We live in a world where knowledge is developing at an ever-accelerating rate. Drink deeply from this ever-springing well of wisdom and human experience. If you should stop now, you will only stunt your intellectual and spiritual growth. Keep everlastingly at it. Read. Read. Read. Read the word of God in sacred books of scripture. Read from the great literature of the ages. Read what is being said in our day and time and what will be said in the future.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Personally, I love to read. I tell my students that my first job was as a proofreader in an M&amp;amp;M factory. You have your own patterns for reading. One thing that helps me is that my wife, Nadine, and I belong to a book group with some friends. During the school year we meet almost monthly. We take turns: a couple chooses a book, hosts the book group in their home, leads the discussion, and serves refreshments afterward. We have read books about a wide variety of subjects. I had never even heard of many of these books before, but I have enjoyed reading them very much.<br><br>In addition, I have always enjoyed words. When I was a boy and I would encounter a word I didn't know, sometimes I would ask my father what it meant. He would reply, "Look it up." My father usually knew the answer, but he wanted me to learn how to look words up. So I would open the dictionary that sat on the bookshelf in our living room and look the word up.<br><br>Later I wanted to learn more words. One summer my friend John Tanner (who later became a BYU English professor) and I worked as groundskeepers at the Oakland California Temple. On some days we would each write five words and their definitions on an index card and put the card in our shirt pocket. Then we would share the words and use them in sentences during the day. My favorite word from that summer was<i>halcyon.</i>It means calm, peaceful, tranquil, or golden. As we pulled weeds and performed other physical labor on the beautiful temple grounds, we would exclaim, "Oh, those halcyon days of youth!" Now, as I look back, I see that they really were halcyon days.<br><br>In our busy lives, how can we make time to continue learning? I believe in consistent, incremental progress--small steps over time. For example, one doesn't learn to play the piano in a single day. One must practice daily for several years. After many small increments, one can eventually play hymns, popular songs, or classical music. Lifelong learning is like that. We need to schedule some time each day to study the scriptures. We can also regularly read a little in other books. We learn "line upon line" and "precept upon precept."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks and Sister Kristen M. Oaks wrote:<br><br><i>There are few things more fulfilling and fun than learning something new. Great happiness, satisfaction, and financial rewards come from this. An education is not limited to formal study. Lifelong learning can increase our ability to appreciate and relish the workings and beauty of the world around us. This kind of learning goes well beyond books and a selective use of new technology, such as the Internet. It includes artistic endeavors. It also includes experiences with people and places: conversations with friends, visits to museums and concerts, and opportunities for service. We should expand ourselves and enjoy the journey.</i><sup>11</sup><br><h2><strong>Two Stumbling Blocks of Learning</strong></h2><br>There are two issues connected with learning about which we must be careful. First, learning can lead to pride. In 2 Nephi Jacob wrote:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:<br><br><i>Pride is the universal sin, the great vice. . . .</i><br><br><i>The antidote for pride is humility--meekness, submissiveness. (See Alma 7:23.) It is the broken heart and contrite spirit.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Humility opens our hearts and minds to learning. By contrast, thinking that we already know everything impedes our learning. King Benjamin taught that a person needs to become "as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Second, we should expect that at times apparent conflicts may arise between secular learning and gospel principles. "[T]he gospel encompasses all truth."<sup>15</sup>At the groundbreaking of the BYU Eyring Science Center in 1948, President George Albert Smith said:<br><br><i>I want to say that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accepts all that is true in the world from whatever source it may come, with the knowledge that it originated with the greatest of all scientists, our Father in Heaven. . . .</i><br><br><i>And so I congratulate the students of this great institution</i>[BYU]<i>to think that you have all the advantages that the people of the world have, plus the advantages of faith in God, a belief in the power of our Heavenly Father, and His inspiration.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br><i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>states:<br><br><i>Students need not ignore difficult and important questions. Rather, they should frame their questions in prayerful, faithful ways, leading them to answers that equip them to give "a reason of the hope that is in" them (1 Peter 3:15) and to articulate honestly and thoughtfully their commitments to Christ and to His Church.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>When human knowledge and the gospel appear to conflict, we should remember that human knowledge is limited. Eternal truth is not limited, but our understanding of it is incomplete. After this life, if we are worthy, we will understand all truth. Meanwhile, we seek answers to faithful questions. We study, ponder, pray, and have patience. We exercise faith in God. He blesses us with greater knowledge, understanding, and peace in our lives.<br><br>We should be humble about what we know and what we do not know. An angel appeared to Nephi. Nephi wrote:<br><br><i>And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</i><br><br><i>And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>We do not know the meaning of all things, but we do know that God loves His children.<br><br>God's wisdom supersedes human knowledge. Elder Oaks wrote:<br><br><i>We are commanded to seek learning by study, the way of reason, and by faith, the way that relies on revelation. Both are pleasing to God. He uses both ways to reveal light and knowledge to his children. But when it comes to a knowledge of God and the principles of his gospel, we must give primacy to revelation because that is the Lord's way.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>We should also remember to put the gospel, not our academic discipline, first in our lives. Jesus said, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."<sup>20</sup><br><h2><strong>The Strength in Learning</strong></h2><br>This is a wonderful time to be on the earth. There are so many opportunities for lifelong learning. If we do our best and seek Heavenly Father's help, He will strengthen us beyond our natural abilities and help us to learn. That learning will enable us to develop personally, will increase our ability to serve others, and will help us to be prepared in all things.<br><br>I testify that the gospel is true. Heavenly Father lives and loves us, and Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James D.

<h1>tional: &quot;My Life Is a Gift; My Life Has a Plan&quot; by Michelle Marchant</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I'm very humbled to be standing before you today. I want you to know I am very honored to be among you. I am especially honored to be among the amazing BYU students who continue to edify me daily in my life.<br><br>At a recent stake conference I attended, the visiting General Authority opened the evening session for questions, and a man in the congregation asked, "Could it be that I have the wrong patriarchal blessing?"<br><br>At first I was startled by his words. But as I pondered the implications of his heartfelt question, I realized that I also had times when I doubted whether or not portions of my patriarchal blessing would really be fulfilled. Can you identify? Are there times in your life's journey when your faith wavers in respect to God's plan for that journey?<br><br>In my experience, following God's plan has been made easier by knowing my relationship to God, experiencing the divine nature of love and service, recognizing the examples of prophets, finding joy and guidance in the temple, learning from the experiences of ­others, and ultimately trusting the wisdom of God's plan for me. During our time together this morning I would like to consider with you these milestones in the journey God has ordained for us. I invite the Spirit to be with us.<br><h2><b>Knowing Our Relationship to God</b></h2><br>When my sister Natalie delivered her second child, I was blessed to visit her family in Wisconsin. One night, while preparing for bedtime, I was singing "I Am a Child of God"<sup>1</sup>with my then three-year-old niece, Amanda. Shelooked up at me from her bed and said, "Aunt Michelle, Heavenly Father made you and He made me." Tears welled in my eyes as I considered the pure doctrine this toddler had expressed. At a very young age Amanda understood one of the most central truths of God's plan: "All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/11/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a>This principle is so significant to Heavenly Father's plan that He emphasizes it in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," the Young Women theme, and the Relief Society declaration,<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1999/10/rejoice-daughters-of-zion?lang=eng"><sup>3</sup></a>as well as in Primary, where young children sing many songs that highlight this simple truth.<br><br>Many modern-day prophets have also underscored the message of our divine nature. Recently our beloved President Thomas S. Monson declared:<br><br><i>I never cease to be amazed by how the Lord can motivate and direct the length and breadth of His kingdom and yet have time to provide inspiration concerning one individual. . . . The fact that He can, that He does, is a testimony to me. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The Lord is in all of our lives.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/consider-the-blessings?lang=eng"><sup>4</sup></a><br><br>Brothers and sisters, for the past few years I have felt impressed to study the nature of God and His plan of salvation. In doing so, I have come to understand some beautiful truths. I bear witness that what Amanda taught me when she was three years old is true: Heavenly Father did make you and me. He made us for a divine purpose. I testify that He knows you by name and that He loves you. One of His greatest desires is "to guide [your] future as he has [your] past."<sup>5</sup>I testify that the Lord is eager to be in your life by sharing His love and His plan for each of you. "Have confidence in the Lord."<sup>6</sup><br><h2><b>Experiencing the Divine Nature of Love and Service</b></h2><br>Elder Quentin L. Cook commented:<br><br><i>Understanding how</i>[Heavenly Father]<i>feels about us</i>[and the potential that He recognizes in each of us]<i>gives us the power to love Him more purely and fully. Personally feeling the reality, love, and power of that relationship is the source of the deepest and sweetest emotions and desires that can come to a man or woman in mortality. These deep emotions of love can motivate us.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2012/02/the-doctrine-of-the-father?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a><br><br>We can show that love in so many simple ways. Recently my sister Natalie posted on Facebook that my sweet Amanda, now twelve years old, had shared her coat with her younger sister Maren on their way to school because Maren had left her coat at home. Amanda's understanding of the profound doctrine of love has motivated her in how she treats other people, particularly her own sister. Her example inspires me.<br><br>I'd like to believe that a portion of Amanda's understanding of her divine nature is derived from her heritage. Her great-grandmother Beatrice Marchant was a woman of noble faith and continual service. Grandma Marchant wrote in one of her personal histories:<br><br><i>The first and most important fact</i>[for me to share with my posterity]<i>is that I was born a "Child of God." . . . I can appreciate and understand the world and the people around me if only I make an effort to do so. I even have the ability to help change the world for better or for worse. This has made my life an interesting experience.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Grandma Marchant was a remarkable woman. She raised fifteen children; cared for her invalid husband for ten years prior to his death while simultaneously providing for her many children; fed every person who walked through the doors of her home, despite her limited resources; worked as one of the first female legislators for the state of Utah; served as Relief Society president at age seventy; and, without fail, acknowledged every birthday and anniversary of each of her enormous posterity, including in-laws. I could go on and on about my grandma's loving, giving heart.<br><br>It is an honor to have learned from a woman who recognized her divine nature in such a profound way that many around her, particularly her posterity, have felt her influence. Grandma Marchant was the epitome of these words taught by Moroni: "That which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God."<sup>9</sup><br><br>I am grateful for the examples of my niece and my grandmother, who have followed God's plan by doing good upon the earth. My desire is that I will also live my life loving and doing good continually so that "the Lord [will] guide [me] continually."<sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>Recognizing the Examples of Prophets</b></h2><br>I likewise find great strength from the examples of prophets, including the brother of Jared and Joseph Smith, who were eager to seek the Lord's guidance to fulfill His divine plan for them.<sup>11</sup>Both of these prophets were impelled by their great faith to turn to the Lord to receive guidance. The brother of Jared sought the Lord's direction for the welfare of his people, particularly their basic needs, such as language, land, and light. Joseph Smith sought wisdom concerning religious truth. Each secluded himself from other people in order to plead with the Lord--one upon a mountain, the other in a grove. Both acknowledged their weaknesses and expressed the desires of their hearts, including ways that their needs might be met. Both men experienced adversity. The brother of Jared and his people lacked light and ventilation in their sea-tight barges; Joseph was seized by a "thick darkness" that threatened him with "despair and . . . destruction."<sup>12</sup><br><br>What transpired next for both of these ­chosen servants was miraculous and powerful. The Lord appeared to each of them, and light was a significant aspect of both of these divine visitations. The Lord touched the stones provided by the brother of Jared, making them instruments of light for the barges.<sup>13</sup>"A pillar of light . . . descended [and] rested upon" Joseph Smith,<sup>14</sup>and he was invited to voice his question about religious truth to God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, receiving a direct answer "that not only changed his life forever but also changed the history of the world."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2013/02/stand-by-my-servant-joseph?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>15</sup></a><br><br>Despite the transcendent importance of these events, I find what occurred after them to be even more significant. Neither the brother of Jared nor the Prophet Joseph kept the light revealed by the Lord secret; they shared it freely with all who would benefit from it. The Jaredite stones became the source of light so that "men, women, and children . . . might not cross the great waters in darkness [to] land upon the shore of the promised land."<sup>16</sup>Joseph first shared the light of wisdom and truth of the First Vision with his family, then with his close friends and associates, and, ultimately, with the world. Brothers and sisters, we wouldn't be sitting here today in the Marriott Center if Joseph Smith had not shared the light he received, nor would we know about the brother of Jared. The far-reaching effects of the light Joseph Smith received and shared are almost incalculable.<br><br>As recorded in the Pearl of Great Price, the Lord revealed to Abraham the doctrine of the eternal nature of spirits. He specifically taught Abraham that there "were organized before the world . . . many . . . noble and great ones."<sup>17</sup>From modern-day revelation we know that prophets like Abraham, the brother of Jared, and Joseph Smith were among those noble and great ones.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_joseph-smith-revealer-christ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>18</sup></a>You too were among the noble and great ones.<sup>19</sup>I testify that your presence and purpose upon this earth are as important to God as the presence and purpose of any of the noble and great ones who have gone before. God is an attentive Father, and, in His eyes, all His children possess nobility and greatness. I value the way in which Elder Neal A. Maxwell captured this doctrine:<br><br><i>The same God that placed that star in a precise orbit millennia before it appeared over Bethlehem in celebration of the birth of the Babe has given at least equal attention to placement of each of us in precise orbits so that we may, if we will, illuminate the landscape of our individual lives, so that our light may not only lead others but warm them as well.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>The lesson I draw from Elder Maxwell's statement is to do like the brother of Jared and the Prophet Joseph did: have faith in the Lord's divine plan for us--both past and future--with the intent to lead others to partake of His light. In doing so we are able to help others progress toward their divine potential.<br><h2><b>Finding Joy and Guidance in the Temple</b></h2><br>I am grateful for the tender experiences of making covenants and serving within God's holy temples. Participating in temple work has been a vital part of discovering my nobility and understanding the Lord's plan for me. Prior to serving my full-time mission to Haiti, I was blessed to receive my endowment in the Salt Lake Temple. I count that experience as one of the most glorious of my life. The love I felt as I passed through the veil into the celestial room, greeted by family and friends, was unfathomable. I am the oldest of eight children, and my parents have been less active in the Church since I was twelve years of age. Trusted friends and relatives were gracious to offer love and support so that I was not alone as I prepared for and was blessed by this sacred ordinance. I recall feeling a strong desire to remain in the celestial room, encircled by these good individuals, so that I could continue to partake of the love that filled my soul.<br><br>I soon realized that the feelings I experienced during my first visit to the temple could be renewed. I've come to appreciate that regularly entering the Lord's house allows me to partake of His love and gain a clearer perspective about my divine potential. It is often within these hallowed walls that I seek and receive the Lord's guidance for my future. Sometimes my request is related to an everyday need: for example, "What is the best direction for this talk that I've been asked to give?" or "Who should serve alongside me in a calling I have just received?" Other times I have sought direction regarding decisions that are of more eternal consequence, such as "Is this college major the best choice for fulfilling my potential?" "Is this job opportunity the right match for me?" or "Should I continue to date this man?"<br><br>Irrespective of the question, the Lord ultimately provides an answer that leads me toward the destiny He has planned for me. In the temple I have become keenly aware that the Lord knows us by name as I hear the name of the person for whom I am performing ordinances repeated over and over. This has confirmed to me that He is aware of me, as He is of each of His children. The power of His words "I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst"<sup>21</sup>has become more tangible. He has designed an individualized plan to help each person to progress so that each can return to live with Him.<br><br>This message is one that I am eager to share with others, especially my own family. I feel great joy watching my family members enter the Lord's house and participate in ordinances that will lead them to know God's plan. Many of my siblings provide opportunities for their teenagers to participate in temple work. It is evident that my nieces' and nephews' experiences in the temple have guided them to make righteous choices for their futures, particularly as they progress into their adult years. As they advance their education, serve missions, date people with high moral standards, and accept opportunities to build God's kingdom, they show that they are committed to fulfilling their divinely appointed plan. I testify that worship and service in His holy house is key to seeking and receiving His direction--to being able to fulfill God's plan and share His love with others.<br><h2><b>Learning from the Experiences of Others</b></h2><br>I would like to share the experience of a young woman who is truly one of the noble and great ones. With time, this young woman chose to make changes in her life and to covenant with the Lord. She is a modern-day individual who allowed her faith in the Lord's plan for her to influence others.<br><br>A few years ago a student who was enrolled in one of my classes (I will refer to her as Anna) was essentially failing. When Anna attended class she portrayed a passion about becoming a teacher. One day I felt impressed to invite Anna to visit with me in my office. Through the course of our discussion I learned that her family background was complicated and challenging. Unfortunately, participating in school and living the gospel had not been high priorities for Anna's family and, therefore, had not become high priorities for Anna. In her formative years she had become disillusioned and profoundly disappointed by the inconsistency, addictions, and destructive behaviors she saw swirling around her.<br><br>Because of her turbulent family situation, Anna was taken into the home of relatives. Her aunt and uncle encouraged her to attend school and participate in extracurricular activities, particularly dance. Anna was wary about church but acknowledged that the young women in her ward unconditionally reached out to her despite her values and minimal church activity. Over time, participation in school and in dance, as well as the love of her relatives, helped Anna develop self-confidence. Ultimately, Anna's relatives encouraged her to apply to BYU. To their delight she was accepted.<br><br>Being accepted at BYU wasn't necessarily the golden ticket for Anna. Her family continued to be unstable, she avoided religious activity, old habits began to resurface, and old wounds refused to heal. At this time in her college experience Anna was enrolled in my class. I felt prompted that I needed to provide Anna another opportunity to demonstrate her commitment to becoming a teacher. Together we created a plan that would help her acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to pass my class and be on the road to becoming a professional educator. To my delight, Anna embraced the plan and passed my class. To my disappointment, I didn't hear from her once the semester ended.<br><br>More than two years later I was working in my office when a young woman appeared at my door--it was Anna. She radiated peace and joy. Something had changed since I had last seen her. When I probed, Anna told me that she had just returned from serving a full-time mission. I was overcome by the complete transformation I saw and felt in her.<br><br>Anna recently disclosed to me that ­during much of her youth and early young adult years she had felt trapped and angry. Many "things" influenced Anna's journey of change--friends, relatives, roommates, the testimonies of ­others, the Book of Mormon, the temple, and so forth. The turning point for Anna was when she realized a need to anchor herself in Christ. She began to feel the light and power of Christ's atoning love, especially when she read the Book of Mormon. Eventually she could not contain the light and love she felt, and she knew that she needed to share them, so she worked with her bishop to prepare to serve a mission. As a missionary Anna found that the more she served, the more she wanted to serve.<br><br>Anna's story doesn't end there. Last December I was jogging along Ninth East near the MTC entrance. As I crossed the street I was pleasantly surprised to see Anna approaching me. This young woman who had struggled with the Church during her youth and had nearly failed my class is now sharing her light and love with the missionaries as an MTC teacher. My heart was full.<br><br>When I asked Anna's permission to share her experiences, she readily agreed and quickly told me that the essence of her story is the transforming influence of the Lord's love and light in her life. While acknowledging that her journey has not been easy, she is quick to add, "The Lord has guided me. He has taken me by the hand and guided my life. Now I can be His instrument. All of the things I have are because of God's hand in my life."<br><h2><b>Trusting God's Plan for You</b></h2><br>Anna's experience reminds me of these tender words:<br><br><i>May today there be peace within. May you trust that you are exactly where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith in yourself and others. May you use the gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. . . . Allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and love.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>I am honored to know Anna and others like her at BYU. Your commitment to rise above the temporal and partake of the divine is inspiring. Clearly you chose to seek your divine nature in your first estate, and, as a result, you were granted the privilege to live in this second estate.<sup>23</sup>So the question before you is, "How will you embrace your<i>second</i>estate?"<br><br>The examples of my niece Amanda, my Grandma Marchant, modern and ancient prophets, and BYU students like Anna have inspired me to embrace my second estate with hope.<br><br>A few years ago a friend gave me a framed quote from an alternate translation of Jeremiah 29:11, which reads, "For I know the plans I have for you. . . . They are plans for good . . . to give you a future and a hope."<sup>24</sup>I have positioned this framed quote in my bedroom so that I see it every morning and night as a reminder that "the promises of the Lord, if perhaps not always swift, are always certain."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/continue-in-patience?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>25</sup></a><br><br>As one who has yet to experience the blessings of marriage, I have shared with you today truths I have wrestled to understand and accept. My tears have wet my pillow many a night over the timing of marriage. I do not know the reason why Heavenly Father's plan for me is a bit different than His plan for my sisters, various friends, and even many of my BYU students and former Young Women. But this I do know: I am a child of God, just as each of you is a noble child of God. He loves us, and He has sent each of us here for an individual and distinct purpose. I am learning that "[His] words are sure and shall not fail, . . . but all things must come to pass in their time."<sup>26</sup><br><br>I rejoice in His plan for me. I know that His promises are sure for each child of God in this room and beyond, even when you cannot fully see or understand His complete design for you individually. Because I have fervently supplicated the Lord and experienced His tender mercies, I can now bear witness that the Lord will reveal His plan to you if you "cheerfully do all things that lie in [your] power; and then . . . stand still."<sup>27</sup><br><br>So rather than question the promises in my patriarchal blessing, I have chosen to show faith, believing the truth found in a Primary song: "My life is a gift; my life has a plan."<sup>28</sup>I promise that your patriarchal blessing is for you to keep! What I have learned in my life's journey is that the Lord will not tell me the end from the beginning, but He is eager "to guide [my] future as he has [my] past."<sup>29</sup><br><br>We read these powerful words in the Bible Dictionary: "Faith . . . must be cultured. . . . The effects of true faith . . . include . . . an actual knowledge that the course of life one is pursuing is acceptable to the Lord."<sup>30</sup>I bear witness that the Lord knows you by name, just as He knows the brother of Jared and the Prophet Joseph. He is so eager to share His infinite love with you. He wants you to feel His love so that you will embrace your life's plan and cherish the gift that it is. Moreover, He wants you to share His love and light with others. Will you accept the invitation to be still, to come to know Him, and to trust His plan for you so that you can in turn share His light and love with others?<br><br>I testify that "He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/04/the-living-christ-the-testimony-of-the-apostles-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>31</sup></a>I know this to be true because I have felt His light and love, which have guided me to know His plan for me. It is the greatest desire of my heart to go forth and share His light, His life, and His hope with all who are within my circle of influence. In His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, the Resurrected Lord, amen.<br><br><i>Michelle Marchant was an associate professor in the BYU Department of Counseling Psychology and Special Education when this devotional address was given on 2 April 2013.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 301;<i>Songbook,</i>2–3.<br><br>2.

<h1>encement Address: &quot;A World Full of Challenges and Opportunities&quot; by L. Tom Perry</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, faculty, and you very extraordinary graduating class: how exciting the day is for each of you. How happy I am to be part of these graduation ceremonies. With fifteen of us rotating this assignment, it is a special thrill to take my turn in offering you my sincere congratulations. From this view I just marvel at the wonderful potential I see in this room and the magnificent opportunities that lie ahead of you.<br><br>I want to initially direct my remarks to you wonderful parents who are here celebrating this great event. That child you have watched over, trained, prayed over, encouraged, put up with on occasion, fed, and clothed is today graduating from the world-famous Brigham Young University. I am certain your heart is swelling with pride for what they have accomplished. I will just pause for a minute and let all of you give a big sigh of relief. Your child made it! Your child is graduating at long last.<br><br>On this happy occasion I am reluctant to tell you that your counseling, teaching, and helping this child is not over. Probably at no time in their life--other than early childhood--will they be more willing to seek your counsel than now. They may be exiting this campus, but they are now entering the school of real life. They are beginning a new phase of their life when decisions are more difficult and will have such a bearing on their future.<br><br>Decisions they are facing may include the following: Do I continue my education and go after an advanced degree? Should I accept this job offer or another? Will I get any job offers? Where will I make my home? The list of questions and concerns goes on and on. These decisions come at a time in their life when the world's divisive message of what is truly important will clamor for their attention and make it difficult to know in which direction to go.<br><br>Parents, you must continue to give sound counsel to your children when it is requested--and sometimes even when it is not! You can choose to continue to be a spiritual compass in their lives, but you must be prepared for it and be willing to offer counsel at the appropriate time. Your counsel should be inspired and insightful--without judgment or equivocation--and be based on the values you hold dear as a follower of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Your children should leave this university knowing that the true source of direction and inspiration lies in looking and pleading heavenward.<br><br>Lest we fall into the pattern warned about in the scriptures:<br><br><i>When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Your children will continue to need your help and direction in finding balance in their lives--to find harmony between employment and family and church and civic responsibilities.<br><br>Now, for you who are graduating: Listen up! We have a lot invested in each one of you, and you and your parents have invested a lot in you to get you to this point. You have decisions and a whole life ahead of you. Today you graduate. Your undergraduate years are now over. You are now finished with this point of your life. You will not travel this road again. There will be no retakes, second chances, or repeats. You have your degree. It has been a lot of hard work. Today you have a great deal of satisfaction for what you have accomplished. You will always have special memories of these wonderful days. With this degree has come accumulated experience and hard-earned wisdom.<br><br>Tomorrow the journey in life resumes for you. The choices you make will make all the difference in what you want to achieve. With all of these new decisions and challenges before you, let me encourage you to seek and find a balance in your future life.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke about finding this proper balance:<br><br><i>I want to plead with you to keep balance in your lives. Do not become obsessed with what may be called "a gospel hobby." A good meal always includes more than one course. You ought to have great strength in your chosen . . . field of expertise. But I warn you against making that your only interest. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Beware of obsession. Beware of narrowness. Let your interests range over many good fields while working with growing strength in the field of your own profession.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>My parents traditionally introduced something to each of their children on their first birthday. Even though I cannot remember this event in my own life, I watched it repeated in the lives of my two brothers and was struck by the insight I have gained through this little exercise. We have often referred to it in our family gatherings. It was just a simple demonstration that the whole family participated in. This demonstration consisted of the following:<br><br>On the child's first birthday, my parents would sit their child in one corner of the living room. Then they would set out four items for the toddler to choose from: a baby bottle, a bank, a toy, and a Bible. We would all sit back and watch as the toddler made his choice from those four items.<br><br>Each item represented different values each of us might have--our four basic needs in mortality. Family tradition held that whichever item the baby chose, it would become their focus in life.<br><br>Now let me report on how valued this tradition has turned out to be. In our family there were three older sisters. Then came, in order, Tom, Ted, and Bob. What were our results? Tom clutched the bank and selected accounting and finance for his chosen profession. Ted grabbed the Bible and is almost always seen with a book in his hand. He became a lawyer.<br><br>Bob was different. Bob crawled over to the four items, sat himself down on the Bible, then picked up the baby bottle in one hand and held the toy in the other and placed the bank between his knees. He was the balanced member of the family. He used his skills in negotiating parts contracts for Boeing.<br><br>These four objects are representative of the different values that each of you graduates might have in your lives--your priorities and how you might understand how to find balance throughout mortality.<br><h2><b>The Bottle</b></h2><br>First, the bottle. The bottle represented good physical health and emotional strength.<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin said: "Good physical and spiritual health can help us to stay on the straight and narrow way."<sup>3</sup><br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>The condition of the physical body can affect the spirit. That's why the Lord gave us the Word of Wisdom. He also said that we should retire to our beds early and arise early (see D&amp;amp;C 88:124), that we should not run faster than we have strength (see D&amp;amp;C 10:4), and that we should use moderation in all good things. . . . A good physical examination periodically is a safeguard and may spot problems that can be remedied. Rest and physical exercise are essential, and a walk in the fresh air can refresh the spirit. Wholesome recreation is part of our religion, and a change of pace is necessary, and even its anticipation can lift the spirit.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Learn the value of maintaining good physical and emotional health throughout your life. You will not only live longer but will also live happier and more fulfilling lives.<br><br>I have been blessed throughout my life to have good health. It has allowed me to serve in many capacities. I never dreamed that I would live to be the age that I am, but how grateful I am to be alive and able to do all that the Lord would still have me do. If you are going to continue to progress spiritually throughout your life, then you must be certain to take care of your physical and emotional needs. Eat right, exercise, pray daily, and keep your covenants and you will be blessed with a productive life. Graduates, remember the health of this special body you have been blessed with.<br><h2><b>The Toy</b></h2><br>Now, the toy. The toy my parents set out represented the need to take time out and to recognize personal worth and add to it. Do things in your spare time that will add to your personal value. Nothing bothers me more in life than seeing wasted time! Schedule your time wisely and make sure there is always time for family, work, relaxation, and reflection.<br><br>Before his call as president of the Church, Elder Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>Our house is to be a<b>house of order.</b>"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (Eccl. 3:1). . . . Such is true in our lives. Let us provide time for family, time for work, time for study, time for service, time for recreation, time for self--but above all, time for Christ.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley counseled us that everyone has an obligation to himself. He needs to get rest and exercise. He needs a little recreation. He must have time to study. Everyone needs time to read the scriptures. He needs time to ponder and meditate and think by himself. Whenever possible, he needs to discuss these things with his sweet companion so that they will enjoy this time together. Learn to plan valuable time for yourself.<br><h2><b>The Bank</b></h2><br>Next is the bank. The bank represented the importance of financial security.<br><br>Financially, we live in a dangerously precarious time--not just in the United States but throughout the entire world. Financial independence is often talked about but rarely practiced by national governments. Sadly, more and more households are following the pattern of political leaders and are living on borrowed funds to meet their daily needs and wants.<br><br>One of the most important lessons you will ever learn is the security and peace that come from living within your means! If your family makes one dollar each week and then spends only ninety-nine cents, then you are living appropriately. If you are spending more than you take in, heartache and sorrow are sure to follow unless and until you learn how to live more providentially.<br><br>Understand that you will not have all of the things in your home when you first start out. My heart aches when I see a young newlywed couple in a larger-than-they-can-afford home with the latest furnishings that borrowed money can buy.<br><br>I agree with Walter Winchell, who said, "People spend money they haven't earned to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like."<sup>6</sup><br><br>You will not have, and you do not need, the new car, the new couch, or the house with the latest and fanciest features money--borrowed money--can buy. Learn to accept a modest living and be okay with that.<br><br>Of course there are some purchases that are appropriate to make with borrowed funds, but too many of our young people today are borrowing money for things they "want" versus things they "need."<br><br>Elder Sterling W. Sill noted:<br><br><i>We cannot separate our success from our statistics. That is, a banker may not be very favorably impressed if we say, "Our financial statistics are terrible but we are wonderful." The banker might want to know about such prosaic things as our assets and liabilities, our income and our outgo, our bank balances and our overdrafts. Planning and record keeping are so closely related in our success that they cannot be discussed separately.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I had a job interview with the officer who had the power to give me employment. He asked me to give him a definition of interest. I gave him the best book definition I could come up with. He said, "No! This is the one I want you to remember: 'Thems that understands it, earns it. Thems that don't, pays it.'" Learn how to live within your income.<br><h2><b>The Scriptures</b></h2><br>That Bible my parents laid out for their toddlers represented the need for individual spiritual strength.<br><br>We teach spiritual strength to our children by offering father's blessings, kneeling in daily family prayer, regularly attending the temple, regularly participating in Church meetings, and participating in daily scripture study.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Nephi explains the purpose of the scriptures when he says:<br><br><i>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>A Christ-centered home will always be a safe haven for our children. The home and the family is the fundamental unit of time and all eternity. We need to teach faith in the Savior in all that we do. That is the message for our children. That is the message that we have for the entire world!<br><br>The scriptures teach us how to become closer to God and His Son, Jesus Christ. They teach us how to live and how to repent when we make mistakes. They remind us of the value each of us has as a son or daughter of God. We are His children. He loves us. He wants us to return to live with Him again. He sent His Son to die for us. Who are we to question our value or worth in His sight? We must always move forward and never look back. Daily prayer and scripture study should be a part of every Latter-day Saint home. Ensure that as you leave this university and establish yourself, wherever you may live, the gospel will always be part of your home.<br><br>Finally, make the gospel of Jesus Christ a vital and active part of your life.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>So to you parents again, I remind you that teaching your children does not end with graduation. The teaching of your children is merely entering a new phase--a new phase for them as they take those additional steps toward independence and a new phase for you as you try to communicate more effectively with them.<br><br>To both parents and graduates, I encourage you to stay on top of technology so that you can keep up with one another and understand one another throughout your lives. No one should go into technological retirement when the last child leaves the nest. Instead, that is when you should be alert and more mentally active--learning new things and preparing yourself for future opportunities to have input in the lives of your posterity.<br><br>I have in my briefcase an iPhone and an iPad. I try to spend time each day learning new ways to use these devices. They are modern miracles! They allow me to access information from nearly everywhere around the world. I can communicate with my son or granddaughter by phone, text, email, FaceTime, Twitter, instant messaging, and a hundred other ways that only a few years ago we had never heard of!<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>I am grateful for the example of my parents and for the foresight they had to instill in their children an understanding of the basic needs we all have and the importance of keeping all things in proper balance within an eternal perspective.<br><br>My prayer is that each of you will leave here today better prepared to meet the world and its challenges. There are endless opportunities for good all around us! May each of you be blessed to find the proper balance in your life spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically is my prayer, in the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>ings of Greatest Worth: Keeping Each Commandment of God</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is with considerable pleasure and appreciation that I again voice my welcome to all of you as we honor and commend those being recognized as graduates and honorees in the program of the day. As many of us will emphasize in these exercises today and tomorrow, the achievements we celebrate are not solo acts. That is, virtually no one being honored has been able to reach the heights of accomplishment alone. Therefore we commend spouses, children, parents, friends, mentors, teachers, advisors, and all others who have contributed to the remarkable attainments we acknowledge in these ceremonies.<br><br>Today we are especially honored to have as our presiding authority and commencement speaker Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Virtually all here know him well, and we are grateful that he and Sister Perry are with us as two of the most avid and loyal supporters of Brigham Young University.<br><br>I hope all of you heard Elder Perry's general conference address earlier this month. I advise you to read it again in the<i>Ensign</i>in the coming May edition or listen to it again online. I will not say more except to commend it to you and confess that his assessment about the increasing casualness in our society today about the Ten Commandments brought to my mind a favorite commencement address given twenty-six years ago next month at Duke University by Ted Koppel. He was a very popular news anchor on ABC for many years--before most of you graduates were born. Time does not permit me to share most of what he said, but I would like to share parts of his message that are still extremely relevant for all of us today.<br><br><i>We have spent 5,000 years as a race of rational human beings . . . searching for truth and moral absolutes. In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone--and say absolutely nothing. . . .</i><br><br><i>Our society finds Truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form Truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder; it is a howling reproach.</i><br><br><i>What Moses brought down from Mt. Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions--they are Commandments.<b>Are</b>, not<b>were.</b></i><br><br><i>The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify, in a handful of words, acceptable human behavior. Not just for then--or now--but for all Time. Language evolves; power shifts from nation to nation; messages are transmitted with the speed of light; Man erases one frontier after another; and yet we and our behavior--and the Commandments which govern that behavior--remain the same.</i><br><br><i>. . . What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Sixth Commandment: "Thou shalt not murder."</i><br><br>[And think of how often we now see violations of]<i>the Seventh Commandment: "Thou shalt not commit adultery."</i><br><br>Mr. Koppel continued with energy and ­conviction. Said he:<br><br><i>Relevant? Of course the Commandments are ­relevant. Simply because we use different terms and tools, the Eighth Commandment is still relevant to the</i>[various financial scandals in the world].<i>The Commandments don't get bogged down in methodology. Simple and to the point: "Thou shalt not steal." Watch</i>[television interviews]<i>and keep the Ninth Commandment in mind: "Thou shalt not bear false witness." . . .</i><br><br><i>When you think about it, it's curious, isn't it? We've changed in almost all things--where we live, how we eat, communicate, travel--and yet in our moral and immoral behavior we are fundamentally unchanged.</i><br><br><i>Maimonides and Jesus summed it up in almost identical words: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." So much for our obligations toward our fellow men. That's what the last five Commandments are all about.</i><br><br><i>The first five are more complex in that they deal with figures of moral authority. The Fifth Commandment requires us to honor our father and mother. . . . Which brings me to the First and, in this day and age, probably the most controversial of the Commandments, since it requires that we believe in the existence of a single supreme God--and then, in the Second, Third, and Fourth Commandments,<b>prohibits</b>the worship of any other gods,<b>forbids</b>that His name be taken in vain,</i>[and]<i><b>requires</b>that we set aside one day in seven to rest and worship Him.</i>[Ted Koppel, commencement speech at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 10 May 1987, 5–8; emphasis in original]<br><br>Well, Ted Koppel said even more than the extensive words that I have just related to you. I was impressed when I first read his talk many years ago after hearing on the news that he had said that the Ten Commandments are not the Ten Suggestions. Even in 1987 it took considerable courage to say what he said on that impressive but largely secular campus. Today, if possible, his words ring even more relevant and important.<br><br>As so many of you complete this wonderful phase of your BYU experience, we hope and expect that you will always remember the most important things that you have learned or solidified in your time here. God does live and loves us as the Eternal Father He is. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, and His effectuation of the Atonement makes all things possible for those who fully take upon themselves His name, make and keep sacred covenants, and do their very best to keep and obey the commandments. Like Ted Koppel, I remind you that those things of greatest worth are not suggestions but requirements to meet the full potential of a BYU graduate.<br><br>I invoke the blessings of heaven upon you, upon your families, and upon all that you do as you go forth to serve, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 25April 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>encement Address: &quot;Metamorphosis and Accountability: A Guide for the ...&quot; by Conrad W. Rosenbrock</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a young man growing up in South Africa, I was blessed with a beautiful vegetable garden. It brought forth plentifully. Among the wonders of the garden were three lovely eggplants. Each was over three feet tall and produced large purple fruit of the highest quality.<br><br>One warm summer day I entered the garden to examine the plants and tend to the garden. Imagine my surprise as I approached the formidable eggplants to discover that one was missing! Upon closer examination I found only a short stem; the rest of the plant, leaves and all, was no-where to be seen. By and by I located the culprit: a six-inch armored caterpillar sporting bright yellow spots on each of its green segments. In a few short days it had consumed the entire plant. On that day my reaction was, "What a nasty, destructive caterpillar!" However, since then my understanding of science and the Creation has grown. I now understand that this was a necessary part of the caterpillar's life cycle so that it could reach its full potential.<br><br>This concept of a metamorphosis interested me as a young boy: the possibility that a creature could change its appearance and abilities by obtaining nourishment and spending some time in a cocoon. The large caterpillar that ate my eggplant would become a beautiful butterfly. Instead of its slow crawling, it would soon fly. Instead of burdening my garden, it would soon contribute to the garden's beauty and fruitfulness as it visited each flower in search of nectar, thus aiding pollination.<br><br>Today is a celebration of the marvelous metamorphosis that has occurred in each of us. For the past several years we have pursued a largely selfish agenda: the enrichment of our own intellects. Was it hard work? Definitely--just as it was hard work for the caterpillar in my garden to consume the large eggplant. BYU has been a lush, formidable eggplant for each of us and an important part of our personal metamorphosis. Each of us has benefited from the trust and sacrifice of so many gardeners: those who understood what we needed to grow and to reach our full potential. Think back on the many hours spent under the tutelage of great minds, the thousands of dollars in subsidized tuition, and the scholarships and grants and sacrifices of family and friends. Think about the many pioneers whose sacrifices from generation to generation have established the infrastructure and greatness of BYU as we have enjoyed it. Each of these beneficiaries believed in us. Each was willing to sacrifice because of what they believed we might become. Today it is our privilege to examine ourselves and see the fruits of their labors.<br><br>And yet the greatest measure of their success is not where we are today but where we will be tomorrow. To quote President Gordon B. Hinckley, "Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability" ("<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_trust-accountability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust and Accountability</a>," BYU devotional address, 13 October 1992).<br><br>"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Articles of Faith 1:13). And that is the standard to which we must remain true. Each of us has the opportunity today to make decisions that can shape our future contributions to the world. We can decide to always be perfectly honest, to contribute our skills and talents to our communities, and to build and serve everywhere we go. We can decide to live up to the expectations and to guard the trust of those who have sacrificed for us. Each of us can choose to be the person that they already believe us to be.<br><br>Finally, let us remember those we will represent forever after: we carry the names of our families, the name and standard of this institution, and the name of Christ. This is our time, and we are ready. Congratulations, Class of 2013.<br><br><i>Conrad W.

<br>
<br>
This is truly an impressive sight. Generally my words of wisdom are relegated to my wife, my four children, and my thirty-two Twitter followers. This audience is a little larger today. (And my comments may be longer than 140 characters.)<br><br>As president of the Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000 members. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>This sea of blue gowns and the collective accomplishment it represents fills my alumni soul with pride. Looking at the seats above, you can see others who have gathered today to honor your tremendous achievement: friends and family who celebrate with you today as you cross that finish line to graduation.<br><br>Four years ago I was thrilled at my own daughter's acceptance to this university and circled this date on my calendar as the day I would celebrate<i>her</i>graduation. But instead of wearing a cap and gown today, Kaitlin is on an island off the coast of Italy wearing a missionary name tag and practical shoes. (I'm proud of that accomplishment too.)<br><br>Since that time we have received many of you into our family circle. Friends, roommates, and extended family are here today. I express my personal congratulations to Zoe, Ashley, Erik, Michael, Matt, Elise, and others we have to come know through our associations here at BYU.<br><br>I also offer congratulations to Josh Merrell for not only graduating today but also surviving twelve consecutive weeks of teaching Italian to my two missionary daughters in the MTC. Josh, tell Paige hello for me. She leaves for Milan on Tuesday.<br><br>Today is a mark of an incredible achievement. Each graduate here today represents a unique story of dedication and perseverance, and we are proud of you. Since my own daughter is<i>not</i>here today, I would like to give you the advice I expected to give her.<br><br>The Apostle Paul likened this life unto a race when he said, "Let us run with patience the race that is set before us" (Hebrews 12:1).<br><br>So, following that analogy, consider the fact that the finish line you cross today is simultaneously a starting line for the next phase of life. (It brings new meaning to the phrase "line upon line," doesn't it?) As you approach that starting line, my advice is first to<i>get ready!</i><br><h2><strong>Get Ready!</strong></h2><br>To<i>get</i>what you want, you must first be<i>ready</i>for what you want.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson stated:<br><br><i>Preparation for life's opportunities and responsibilities has never been more vital. We live in a changing society. Intense competition is a part of life. . . . Preparation is not a matter of<b>perhaps</b>or<b>maybe.</b>It is a mandate. The old phrase "Ignorance is bliss" is forever gone. Preparation precedes performance.</i>["Duty Calls,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, 43; emphasis in original]<br><br>I am confident that your education at BYU has prepared you academically, practically, and spiritually to be ready to "run with patience the race that is set before" you and that you will perform well.<br><h2><strong>Get Set!</strong></h2><br>Next, you must<i>get set--</i>or, in other words, you must be<i>set</i>in the values you have internalized here. Continue to stand firmly planted and "be not moved" (D&amp;amp;C 87:8) in the high standards of integrity that you have incorporated into your lives here at BYU.<br><h2><strong>Go!</strong></h2><br>The third step is to<i>go!</i><br><br>Just as our students consider the world our campus, BYU alumni have truly<i>gone</i>forth from this campus in excellence to work and serve in communities locally and all around the globe. Now it is your turn to<i>go</i>and do the same. Remember to take the Spirit of the Y with you and to represent us well.<br><h2><b>And Return</b></h2><br>My final admonition is to look for opportunities to<i>return.</i><br><br>Luke 12:48 states: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required."<br><br>The race of life often brings you full circle on life's track, so you will be able to return and bless BYU with your time, talent, and treasure.<br><br>As alumni you can offer your time and talent by mentoring and preparing the next generation of BYU students. You can participate in local chapters, attend sporting events, and wear blue on casual Friday. Look to hire fellow BYU graduates and for other opportunities to support the Cougars.<br><br>It may not seem like it today, but you will be able to share your treasure too. Seven of the last eight buildings constructed on campus have been substantially funded by generous donors. These donations have come in every size from individual alumni and from members of the President's Leadership Council.<br><br>The current construction of the new Life Sciences Building reminds us that there will always be a need for BYU to have state-of-the-art resources for its students.<br><br>The privilege of giving back is not dependent on how much or how little you may have. So please don't block our number on your caller ID.<br><br>Giving is a form of service that always blesses both parties. I testify that as my family and I have served this university, we have been blessed immeasurably.<br><br>Thank you for all you have done as students here on campus and all that you will do as alumni of Brigham Young University.<br><br>I leave these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael O'Connor was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 25April 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>tional: &quot;The Truth of All Things&quot; by Ryan Holmes</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was ten or eleven years old, my twin brother and I went on a hike up the mountain just north of Y Mountain. Together, with a few friends, we woke up early and climbed straight up the face and then scampered across the top to the peak overlooking Rock Canyon.<br><br>On our way back down we ran into a small rattlesnake. Being the excitable kids we were, we surrounded the poor creature and wouldn't let it escape. We became so bold as to pick it up by the tail as it would try to slither away. We'd hold it for a second or two and then drop it when our nerves gave in. The potentially deadly consequence of our actions didn't deter us from our foolishness.<br><br>When we got home, my mother asked me if everything went okay on the hike. I mumbled something about a rattlesnake. She then related to me that at about the same time we would have been fooling around with the snake, she had received a strong impression that we were in danger. She had knelt and prayed for us. I was astonished. How did she know we were in trouble? This is my earliest recollection of what has become many experiences in which my mother received specific inspiration from the Holy Ghost in the very moment she needed it. At the time it seemed mysterious to me--this idea of the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I wondered how it really worked. I understood that the Holy Ghost was a personage of spirit, but I puzzled over how He could be helping everyone at once.<br><br>Years later, during my freshman year at BYU, I found myself sitting in a Physics 122 class. One day we were discussing the theoretical limit of the speed of light--about 300,000,000 meters per second. For the non-physics majors, that's more than 670 million miles per hour.<br><br>The professor said, "It is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel." Then he paused and said, "But we know of something faster--the speed of prayer." He reasoned that if God has a body as tangible as man's, then He occupies a discreet place in the universe. And we believe we can instantaneously communicate with Him. So there must be something faster than the speed of light.<br><br>Again I found myself reflecting upon the nature of the power of the Holy Ghost. Keep in mind that this was in 1985, so there was no Internet and there were no smartphones or wireless networks that convey data all over the world to millions of people simultaneously in a matter of seconds. Today, with our current experience, it doesn't even stretch our minds to imagine technology that is capable of sending instantaneous and personalized messages to millions--even billions--of people at the same time.<br><h2><b>Celestial Technology</b></h2><br>Today I'd like to discuss just a few of the things I have learned since my youth about the power of the Holy Ghost and the nature of truth. Obviously this won't be a complete treatise on the Holy Ghost but a personal reflection. I humbly add my testimony to that of Moroni, who declared, "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of<i>all things.</i>"<sup>1</sup>I probably quoted this scripture a thousand times as a missionary and mostly thought of it in the context of knowing the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. But this last part of Moroni's promise is a very compelling statement that opens up a world of possibilities: How do we enable the revelatory power of the Holy Ghost? What kind of truth does the Holy Ghost reveal? What exactly is included in "all things"?<br><br>Our world is now filling up with smartphones, smart TVs, smart cars, and smart appliances--and, coming soon, smart glasses, watches, and clothing. This connected technology is adaptive and dynamic and is becoming ever present. Websites, apps, and mobile devices track your every move. Every click, every piece of content you look at, how long you engage with it, your location, and just about anything and everything else is recorded. This information is sent every few seconds to massive data centers and is used to predict and then influence your future behavior. The trend toward more personal technological integration is increasing and will yield technology in the future that will be as startling to you as the smartphone is to your grandparents. It is amazing and alarming at the same time.<br><br>But as impressive as modern technology is, we have access to a celestial communication network that is infinitely more pure and capable than man's smartest technology. It has unlimited bandwidth, is infinitely fast, is personalized to every soul, and has no societal or personal downside. You can listen to me today--and I will say a few things that you will most likely forget--but through the power of the Holy Ghost you can receive a message that is specifically for you. This message will not be based upon your past behavior or your preferences but will be based upon what the Lord knows you need and will be presented to your mind in the context of your life and your future behavior. It will occupy a special place in your consciousness--a place where it can be recalled quickly in the very moment you need it. And it will come to you with the requirement that you act upon it. I hope you will be open to the specific thoughts the Holy Ghost may put in your mind over the next twenty minutes.<br><br>My mission president said something to me right before I left the mission field that I didn't fully appreciate at the time. He said to the group of us departing missionaries, "You see things more clearly now than you will until midlife." Well, here I am twenty-five years later, at midlife, finally understanding what he meant. He meant that as missionaries we had been in a special situation where our personal righteousness and our desire to do God's will aligned in a way that is difficult to achieve outside the mission field. Consequently we had enjoyed the influence and companionship of the Holy Ghost more fully than we would again until midlife. And he was right. You come home and pursue your education; you worry about your finances and your social life; and then come your spouse, your children, and your career. It's a struggle to manage all the priorities and all the distractions.<br><h2><b>Be Specific</b></h2><br>Missionaries know that the first law of heaven--and of missionary success--is obedience. Righteousness and truth are inseparably connected.<sup>2</sup>I learned that when I was obedient, when I was trying my best to be righteous, I had a valid expectation to have the companionship of the Holy Ghost. I also learned that I had to explicitly ask for specific guidance. Let me repeat that:<i>explicitly</i>ask for<i>specific</i>guidance. You have to ask because God is no respecter of persons--He loves all His children and has repeatedly told them, "Ask, and ye shall receive";<sup>3</sup>"seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."<sup>4</sup>Asking is an important part of the law that governs receiving. And not only should we ask, but we should ask for specifics. Like President Thomas S. Monson has often said, "When we deal in generalities, we rarely have success; but when we deal in specifics, we rarely have a failure."<sup>5</sup>As a missionary I learned to pray for very specific things.<br><br>Then I came home from my mission and life got busy. School and marriage followed quickly, and I became very focused on my future. Over time my prayers gradually slipped back into generalities. Why does that happen? Do we think the details of our lives are too mundane for the Lord? Or do we just become lazy?<br><br>My thinking changed one day while I was sitting in a mechanical engineering seminar my junior year. I remember it clearly. The professor, Carl Sorenson, said something to the effect of, "You students here at BYU should become the smartest engineers in the world. Not only do you have the best professors, but you have the gift of the Holy Ghost to help you learn truth." That's right! Like Moroni said, "The truth of all things."<br><br>I thought to myself, "You mean to tell me that I can pray about calculus, physics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics?" Yes! All those topics are covered under "the truth of all things" clause.<br><br>From that time forward I began being more specific in my prayers. I prayed over individual homework problems, assignments, and principles. And while I don't remember hearing a voice or receiving some great manifestation, I would often wake up in the morning with more clarity than I had the night before. I learned that when I combined my best efforts with very specific pondering and prayer, things went better--much better. And the truths of some things were made manifest to me by the power of the Holy Ghost. I wholeheartedly recommend the practice of being very specific in your personal prayers and avoiding the generalities that so easily turn into vain repetition.<br><br>A few years ago I attended a priesthood leadership training session over which President Boyd K. Packer was presiding. His topic was revelation, and he had us open the hymnbook and read the words to "Come unto Him."<sup>6</sup>I had never sung or read this hymn before, but I really appreciate the message it contains about the nature of revelation. It reads:<br><br><i>I wander through the still of night, </i><br><i>When solitude is ev'rywhere-- </i><br><i>Alone, beneath the starry light, </i><br><i>And yet I know that God is there. </i><br><i>I kneel upon the grass and pray; </i><br><i>An answer comes without a voice. </i><br><i>It takes my burden all away </i><br><i>And makes my aching heart rejoice.</i><br><br><i>When I am filled with strong desire </i><br><i>And ask a boon of him, I see</i><br><i>No miracle of living fire, </i><br><i>But what I ask flows into me. </i><br><i>And when the tempest rages high </i><br><i>I feel no arm around me thrust, </i><br><i>But ev'ry storm goes rolling by </i><br><i>When I repose in him my trust.</i><br><br>What I understood from President Packer's explanation of this hymn was that even when we feel alone and "feel no arm around" us, the answers do eventually come "without a voice," the storms do go "rolling by," and life's most important lessons are learned. Truth usually distills upon our souls like the morning dew--imperceptibly.<br><h2><b>Yield to the Enticings</b></h2><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord repeatedly counsels missionaries to "open your mouths and spare not"<sup>7</sup>and to "speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts," with the promise that "it shall be given you ... in the very moment, what ye shall say."<sup>8</sup>I believe there is a key here to enabling the power of the Holy Ghost. When we are doing our best to keep the commandments, then our<i>first</i>thoughts and<i>first</i>impressions are often the inspired ones. I have observed this phenomenon many times in my life.<br><br>Here's a typical scenario at my house. Let's call it the parable of the messy basement. After a long day of work I come home and find that every friend in the neighborhood has been at my house playing in our basement. The couch pillows are piled at the bottom of the stairs (to accommodate base jumping from the landing), every toy from the toy closet is on the floor, the blankets are all over the place--you get the picture. Something inside of me softly says, "Go join in the fun. Play with the kids. Don't make a big deal about the mess. You can clean it up later." This is the first thought that comes--from the heart, from my best self--and it is inspired.<br><br>But then something else kicks in--a second thought, a more "natural" response: "Wait a minute. I've been working all day. I shouldn't have to clean this up. Haven't these kids learned anything? I better teach them a lesson. Where's my wife?" Well, I can tell you from experience that option number two, in any of its various forms, never works out as initially conceived. Just follow the first impression. It's usually the right one--the one that leads to more Christlike behavior. King Benjamin called this yielding "to the enticings of the Holy Spirit," putting off the natural man, and becoming like a child.<sup>9</sup>When we learn to heed the promptings of the Holy Ghost, these feelings become stronger and more frequent.<br><br>Joseph Smith said to John Taylor (as recorded by John Taylor):<br><br><i>Elder Taylor, you have been baptized, you have had hands laid upon your head for the reception of the Holy Ghost, and you have been ordained to the holy priesthood. Now, if you will continue to follow the leadings of that spirit, it will always lead you right. Sometimes it might be contrary to your judgment; never mind that, follow its dictates; and if you be true to its whisperings it will in time become in you a principle of revelation so that you will know all things.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Alma explained the process of spiritual growth this way:<br><br><i>It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the<b>heed and diligence</b>which they give unto him.</i><br><br><i>And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Heed and diligence are like the Lord's encryption technology. The mind of the Lord, as taught by the Holy Ghost, is only revealed to those who are willing to act. This is the "sincere heart" and "real intent"<sup>12</sup>that Moroni says are prerequisite to having the truth of the Book of Mormon manifest by the power of the Holy Ghost. As missionaries we observe that the truths of the gospel are protected, or hidden, from the insincere or unprepared. Just asking "Is the Book of Mormon true?" or "Is Joseph Smith a true prophet?" is not enough. Those who are truly not willing to heed heavenly counsel rarely receive it. If the unprepared were not kept from the mysteries, as Alma put it, then they would stand condemned before the Lord, having refused the light offered them. This is the case for sign seekers--those who want a manifestation who do not have real intent. The Lord said:<br><br><i>Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light.</i><br><br><i>And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.</i><sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Agency Drives the Show</b></h2><br>So let's recap a little: We need to be righteous so that we have a valid claim upon the companionship of the Holy Ghost. We need to ask for specifics in our prayers and ponderings. We need to recognize and act upon the enticings of the Spirit, which are often given as our first impressions "in the very moment" of need.<br><br>But there will be other moments throughout our lives when we will be left unto ourselves,<sup>14</sup>when we may not recognize the promptings of the Spirit. Remember that mortality is a probationary state--a time to learn and a time to become more like the Savior by exercising our agency. There are many circumstances in which the Lord leaves it completely up to us. He wants to see if we are learning to act for ourselves. He wants to measure the gap between our will and His will. The Holy Ghost is our guide, not our chauffeur, through life. The Lord said:<br><br><i>Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things<b>of their own free will,</b>and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are<b>agents unto themselves.</b></i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said during a BYU devotional: "Well, maybe it will be a little shock to you, but never in my life did I ever ask the Lord whom I ought to marry. It never occurred to me to ask him. I went out and found the girl I wanted."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-r-mcconkie_agency-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a>She happened to be the prophet's daughter, Amelia Smith. Elder McConkie's point wasn't that we shouldn't counsel with the Lord over life's big decisions; instead, he was emphasizing the important role that our own agency plays. He further said:<br><br><i>And so we're faced with two propositions. One is that we ought to be guided by the spirit of inspiration, the spirit of revelation. The other is that we're here under a direction to use our agency, to determine what we ought to do on our own; and we need to strike a fine balance between these two.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Thus life is a complex mixture of circumstance, environment, and agency. But still there are some who blame God or deny His existence because of the suffering and injustice they see in the world. They lack the proper perspective and understanding of the central role that agency plays in the plan of salvation. My experience has been that the hardest questions in life--questions about cruelty, war, injustice, inequality, abuse, disability, death, and all of these tough situations--are best understood in the context of man's agency, both individually and collectively. In Doctrine and Covenants 58 the Lord said:<br><br><i>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.</i><br><br><i>Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>We believe in God's omniscience, that all things are present before Him and He sees them all.<sup>19</sup>But we do not believe in determinism. We believe that the dominant feature of mortality is the agency of man, and it drives the show here on earth and in the eternities.<br><h2><b>Truth Through Trials</b></h2><br>Some truth can only be discovered through trial and hardship and over a long time. We have a choice about life's trials. We can choose to draw close to the Lord, trust in Him, and learn something of His character and ours, or we can just suffer. I like how Lehi explained it to his young son Jacob. He said:<br><br><i>Thou art my first-born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness....</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, Jacob ..., thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall</i><em><strong>consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.</strong></em><br><br><i>Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>I really like the phrase "consecrate thine afflications for thy gain." It gives me perspective about the purpose of mortality.<br><br>When I was five years old, my father and his brother were killed in a tragic plane crash in Alberta, Canada, leaving my mother to raise nine children on her own. I remember being told at the time that God had called my dad on a mission to the spirit world and that's why his plane crashed. God caused my Dad's plane to crash? While I'm sure the intent behind saying something like that was good, it made no sense to me, and I have learned for myself that this is not true. God's foreknowledge of things is not the same as His causing all things to happen. We don't need to attribute cause to ascribe meaning. Did God cause it? No. But was He keenly aware of my family's circumstance? Yes. Was there great meaning in the trial of our lives? Yes.<br><br>I testify, like Lehi, that "all things have been done in the wisdom of him who<i>knoweth</i>all things,"<sup>21</sup>which is not the same as<i>causeth</i>all things. Somehow the Lord helped turn the tragedy of my father's death into a blessing for my family. I grew up knowing absolutely that my family was covered by the power of the priesthood and temple covenants. It felt like a current blessing, not a future one, to me. I learned many more lessons because I grew up an orphan--all of which I count as great blessings in retrospect.<br><h2><b>Information Glut and Digital Noise</b></h2><br>So here we are living on this earth, working out our salvation. Our challenge is to learn to distinguish between good and evil, between truth and error, and to make our choices. Our Father hasn't altogether left us, and we have the right to the companionship of the Holy Ghost to help guide us. Learning to enable the influence of the Holy Ghost is critically important.<br><br>Speaking of the days that lie in our future, the Lord said:<br><br><i>And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</i><br><br><i>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Those who will abide the day of the Lord's coming will have taken the Holy Spirit to be their guide. However, we live in a day when there are many competing sources of information that challenge the relevance of eternal truth. Our society suffers from information glut. We receive constant "feeds" of information that are mostly devoid of context and meaning. Information flies at us indiscriminately from a myriad of sources. This modern truth requires no action on our part, except maybe to hit the "Like" button once in a while. The war in Afghanistan, the latest political intrigue, the weather tomorrow, the NBA playoffs, that funny YouTube video, and the most recent post on Facebook all occupy the same informational strata: "Amusing, but no action required." We mostly skip along the surface, rarely diving deep into a matter, because the sheer volume of information we are processing dictates such behavior. There just isn't time. And the relevance of the content--as it is usually referred to now--is judged solely by what is "most popular" or "most recent."<br><br>But real truth has never been judged on those merits. Eternal truth is a view of things as they really are.<sup>23</sup>It is also transactional--meaning that there is an attached responsibility to act upon it, to integrate it. Remember the HD encryption technology the Lord uses:<b>H</b>eed and<b>D</b>iligence! It's built into the system. We cannot hope to have more truth than we have now unless we apply what we already know.<br><br>Besides information glut, there are other potential challenges to enabling the power of the Holy Ghost that I didn't face twenty-five years ago. I have a theory about the general shape of the learning curve--something I recognized as a college student. It is shaped like an<i>S.</i><br><br>On a graph, this<i>S-</i>shaped learning curve shows the relationship between the amount of continuous, uninterrupted time we devote to something and the output quality of that endeavor. Whenever we undertake a task or begin a project or an assignment, there is a certain amount of start-up time required to get acclimated (the bottom of the<i>S</i>). Then we eventually get into "the zone" (the middle to the top of the<i>S</i>), where every unit of time we spend yields more output (i.e., new knowledge) than was possible during start‑up mode. In the zone we dive deep, and we become totally immersed in focused thought. The key is to get into the zone quickly and stay there as long as possible. But in today's connected world we are constantly interrupted by buzzing, beeping, and ringing notifications that we assume require an immediate reaction. Hyper attention to digital noise causes us to slide right back down the learning curve, forever stuck in start‑up mode--the area of the learning curve where our efforts are the least productive.<br><br>We are being conditioned to react in a certain way to digital stimulus, and this rewiring of our brains is not without consequence. We are developing a form of societal attention deficit disorder. A recent study revealed that the average person checks their phone 150 times per day, or every six and a half minutes.<sup>24</sup>Some sociologists are just now beginning to examine the potential consequences of this behavior. In his book<i>Present Shock,</i>Douglas Rushkoff wrote:<br><br><i>We tend to exist in a distracted present, where forces on the periphery are magnified and those immediately before us are ignored. Our ability to create a plan--much less follow through on it--is undermined by our need to be able to improvise our way through any number of external impacts that stand to derail us at any moment. Instead of finding a stable foothold in the here and now, we end up reacting to the ever-present assault of simultaneous impulses and commands.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>There are many advocates for new technology and maybe not enough who are examining the other end of that stick. I am certainly not against technology--far from it. But I am for the deliberate use of technology and the careful consideration of all its consequences. And I am worried that the companionship we have with our smartphones is competing with the companionship of the Holy Ghost. This potentially harmful situation is created when we forget that there are "things to act and things to be acted upon."<sup>26</sup>We ourselves are the things that act. Technology is a thing to be acted upon--by us. If we allow that role to become reversed, and we find ourselves mostly reacting to our technology, then watch out! We might be holding a rattlesnake by the tail and not even realize the danger!<br><br>Don't just ingest whatever comes your way via text, email, data feeds, streams, and notifications. Make a conscious choice. You decide what, when, and how you are going to interact digitally. The next time you download an app and it asks you if you want to enable push notifications, really think about what you are agreeing to. Don't get trapped in a compulsion loop that keeps you from the important tasks and people right in front of you. Consider carving out some digital quiet time each day. Sometimes you need to disconnect and be completely alone so that you can commune with God and receive the truth He wants to reveal through the power of the Holy Ghost. Moses understood the importance of climbing the mountain to get away from the din of the herd.<br><br>In conclusion, I'd like to tell you something Joseph Smith once said about the gift of the Holy Ghost:<br><br><i>I have an old edition of the New Testament in the Latin, Hebrew, German and Greek languages....</i><br><br><i>... I thank God that I have got this old book; but I thank him more for the gift of the Holy Ghost....</i><br><br><i>... The Holy Ghost ... is within me, and comprehends more than all the world; and I will associate myself with him.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>We might say in our hearts something similar: I have this smartphone in my pocket. It can do some amazing things, and I am thankful for it. But I am more impressed by and thankful for the gift of the Holy Ghost. He is smarter than all the world, and I will associate myself with Him.<br><br>May we embrace that association, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ryan Holmes was director of the Digital Media Group at BYU Broadcasting when this devotional was given on 7May 2013.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>tional: &quot;The M&amp;Ms of Missionary-Minded Members&quot; by Gary E. Arnoldson</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a blessing and an honor to be asked to speak to you today. I never dreamed of having such a great opportunity as this, and I pray that the Spirit will be with both of us. I am just a country kid from Moroni, Utah, so this is extraordinary for me.<br><br>As I prayed about what I should talk about today, I had many topics come into my mind. It was hard to decide what would be best for you as well as something I'm passionate about. The letter I received said that I should pick a topic that is important to me.<br><br>One of my favorite candies is M&amp;amp;M's, and one of my favorite interests is missionary work. So, with those in mind, I started to think of the M&amp;amp;M's of missionary-minded members, for that is what I am involved in as a stake president.<br><h2><b>1. Miraculous Conversion</b></h2><br>The first M&amp;amp;M that I want to address is<b>miraculous conversion.</b>When I hear that phrase I think of Alma, Ammon, Wilford Woodruff, Paul, and other great missionaries, and then I think, "That's way above me," and I turn it off. But this is the start of the sweetness of missionary desires.<br><br>I came from a family in Moroni that wasn't active. I can't remember sitting in a ­sacrament meeting with my mom and dad. My dad would always pound on the furnace register to make sure I got up for church, but there were long stretches when I can't remember going to church. My dad was a schoolteacher, so in the summers we'd go fishing or hiking or camping or anything else--just not church. One time, after being gone all summer, I went to church, and Veldon Blackburn, a friend of mine, asked why I had gone inactive. I told him I wasn't inactive; I just didn't come to church.<br><br>During the summer a few years later I worked hard to be the best and get the best job in Moroni, which was working on the vaccination crew for the Moroni Feed Company. I worked really hard and made the crew. We could go through a flock of ten thousand turkeys in an hour and not lose one. One time we were vaccinating some turkeys up by Fountain Green, and they were just a little bigger than usual. We were taking them out of the brooder coop, vaccinating them, putting them into a truck, and taking them out to the growing pens. We had finished vaccinating about half the flock when I grabbed a turkey, gave it a shot, and threw it up into the truck. As I grabbed another turkey, the last turkey decided it didn't want to be in the truck, so it came out and hit me in the back of my arm, and I gave myself the next shot in my hand between my thumb and index finger. I will now never get fowl cholera, erysipelas, or Newcastle disease.<br><br>I grew a big abscess about the size of a ­tennis ball in the palm of my hand, so I went to the family doctor, Dr. Speakman, in Mount Pleasant. After a few months of lancing the abscess and getting the gunk out of it, the doctor said he would have to take three of my fingers off to save my hand. I'm kind of attached to those fingers--and they make it much easier to play the guitar! I told Dr. Speakman that I wanted to speak to my dad. He worked just up the street in the school district office, so Dr. Speakman left the room to contact him. As soon as he left I started to really pray--­probably the first sincere prayer of my life. Before the doctor came back in with my dad, I knew what my dad was going to say and what he was going to do. I knew that I would not lose my fingers or my hand. A calm and a peace had settled over me, and I just knew I would be okay.<br><br>That day I made some promises to the Lord: (1) I would live the Word of Wisdom to the best of my knowledge and ability, and (2) I would serve Him all of my life (I didn't realize people lived so long). Back then that meant I would serve a mission. Both of these promises I have worked hard to keep.<br><br>My dad took me out of the office and put me in the car, and we went straight to Provo to a specialist--Dr. Aaron. The hand took over a year to heal. In fact, the next summer, when I was in basic training, I remember leaving blood on the rocks in the field where we did push-ups.<br><br>I had had a simple prayer answered, and I knew it, and the important thing is that I knew the Lord knew me. I can't explain the peace and comfort that came over me in the doctor's office that day. It took a few years to even understand what had really happened that day in that office, but it has made all the difference in my life--and for a seventeen-year-old kid in a small town hanging around the friends I had, keeping the Word of Wisdom was a big challenge.<br><br>No one in my family had ever gone on a mission. It was not expected of us. So when I announced I wanted to serve a mission, it surprised many. It may have even shaken a few testimonies. I had another hurdle to overcome though, because in those days the government would only let two missionaries out from a ward at any one time, and I had a lot of friends whose parents were active who would fill up that quota. So I joined the Army National Guard so that I would not have to take one of those spots for missionaries.<br><br>My miraculous conversion was nothing more than the answer to a simple but very sincere prayer. I interview many young people for missions these days, and I ask them if they have asked in prayer what the Lord would want them to do about going on a mission. I am surprised by how many don't ask. Most are just going along with the next step in their life, trying to make the best decisions they can. It is important to know what the Lord wants of you.<br><br>A couple of years ago in the Mount Pleasant North Stake we couldn't get our young men to go on missions. We only had nine missionaries out from our stake, and that's not very many. So we prayed about it and really made a push for more missionaries. Seven young ladies stepped up and sent their missionary applications in, and at that point we had as many young ladies as young men on missions.<br><br>I just released the first two of those young ladies this last week. What powerful missionaries they have become! But what is really exciting and neat is the great mothers they will become for the next generation of missionaries.<br><br>The sweetness of this M&amp;amp;M is so important that I want to tell you about my last son, Kyle. He is a great kid. When he was sixteen he started to be a cowboy and started to ride bulls--and there is only one thing stupider than a bull. When Kyle turned nineteen, I filled out his papers for his mission--and those papers sat. Some of his friends got things together and left on their missions, but not Kyle. I think we filled out two sets of mission papers for him, and then when he was coming up on twenty-one, I threw out all his papers.<br><br>Later that year he came to me asking where his missionary papers were, and I hit the fan. I told him that I was sick and tired of his hypocrisy and that I didn't want him to go on a mission--in fact, I didn't care if he ever went on a mission. Then it flashed before me that I was going to heck for treating my son so rotten and preventing him from going on a mission instead of bringing salvation to his soul. So I asked him if he had been praying about a mission. He told me that he had been putting a lot of thought into it and had had some feelings about going. That wasn't good enough. I had heard that before, so I told him he had to find out what the Lord wanted him to do. I was very heated throughout this conversation, and it would have been very easy for Kyle to say, "Well, so much for that." But he didn't. He had been feeling something, and I think the Spirit had already touched his life. He did go on a mission and is now married to a great young lady, and their second boy is on the way.<br><br>It is not a big thing. It is the small whisper. "Miraculous" is anything coming from the Lord, for He is the giver of all good gifts. As it says in Doctrine and Covenants 4:7, "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen."<br><h2><b>2. "A Marvellous Work and a Wonder"</b></h2><br>The second M&amp;amp;M is<b>"a marvellous work and a wonder."</b>Isaiah 29:14 states: "Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder." In Jacob 5 in the Book of Mormon we read the allegory of the olive tree. Verse 6 says, "After many days"; verse 15 says, "A long time passed away"; and verse 29 says, "A long time had passed away." But in the last few verses of this long chapter we read about "the Lord of the vineyard" doing what He had done before, except this time He worked alongside the servants. He did not leave the vineyard or the servants again:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.</i>[Jacob 5:70–72]<br><br>Just think about who is in charge of this work and what has happened in the few short years since the Restoration. The Church is covering all the earth. We are still but few, but look at the marvelous work and wonder that has happened. Doctrine and Covenants 4:1 says, "Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men." That is true today more than ever before. We are witnessing that coming to pass. We are not only witnesses to it happening, we are also participants in it.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 88:72–73 states:<br><br><i>Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.</i><br><br>Is it time? Every one of you will remember where you were when you heard President Thomas S. Monson's timeless declaration that lowered the age for missionary service. I even remember where I was and the date when it was announced that all worthy males would be able to hold the priesthood. I was west of Hanksville, Utah, just before you get to Caineville. It was June 10, 1978. That was a ­pivotal point for the Church, but this announcement is also far-reaching and will prove to be eternal in its consequences.<br><br>The greatest part of being seventeen was that I knew everything. I was on top of my world. But I soon found out that there was something greater than myself, and I wanted to keep the promises I had made. In Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 we read:<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br>This marvelous work and a wonder took on new meaning for me. It became my greater cause.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 128:22 reads:<br><br><i>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</i><br><br>The most important part of the marvelous work and a wonder is the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. I have a 1914 edition of the Book of Mormon. It was given to me only a couple of years ago by the daughter of Leland Erastus Anderson. The miracle of this book is that the inside cover of the book has a note showing that it was given to my grandfather by his uncle Hyrum Smith Arnoldsen, which gave me a tie to know the power of the Book of Mormon in missionary work. You see, there are two branches of the same family represented here--an active, faithful branch and a wayward branch--and there is nothing more powerful than the Book of Mormon and the covenants of the temple to bring a family together again. A talk on the Book of Mormon is a whole different talk, but the importance of it cannot go unnoticed when it comes to a marvelous work and a wonder. President Ezra Taft Benson stated:<br><br><i>The time is long overdue for a massive ­flooding of the earth with the Book of Mormon for the many reasons which the Lord has given. In this age of ­electronic media and mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a ­monumental way.</i><br><br><i>We have the Book of Mormon, we have the members, we have the missionaries, we have the resources, and the world has the need. The time is now! . . .</i><br><br><i>I have a vision of homes alerted, of classes alive, and of pulpits aflame with the spirit of Book of Mormon messages.</i><br><br><i>I have a vision of home teachers and visiting teachers, ward and branch officers, and stake and mission leaders counseling our people out of the most correct of any book on earth--the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>I have a vision of artists putting into film, drama, literature, music, and paintings great themes and great characters from the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>I have a vision of thousands of missionaries going into the mission field with hundreds of passages memorized from the Book of Mormon so that they might feed the needs of a spiritually famished world.</i><br><br><i>I have a vision of the whole Church getting nearer to God by abiding by the precepts of the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>Indeed, I have a vision of flooding the earth with the Book of Mormon. . . .</i><br><br><i>I do not know fully why God has preserved my life to this age, but I do know this: That for the present hour He has revealed to me the absolute need for us to move the Book of Mormon forward now in a marvelous manner. You must help with this burden and with this blessing which He has placed on the whole Church, even all the children of Zion.</i><br><br><i>Moses never entered the promised land. Joseph Smith never saw Zion redeemed. Some of us may not live long enough to see the day when the Book of Mormon floods the earth and when the Lord lifts His condemnation. (See D&amp;amp;C 84:54–58.) But, God willing, I intend to spend all my remaining days in that glorious effort.</i>["Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon," Ensign, November 1988, 4–6]<br><h2><b>3. Magnify the Work--Self-Salvation</b></h2><br>The third M&amp;amp;M is<b>magnify.</b>In Doctrine and Covenants 4:4 we read:<br><br><i>For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul.</i><br><br>The gospel is as true today as it was in 1829, when this section of the Doctrine and Covenants was given. A mission is not a saving ordinance, but it does bring salvation to the soul. I have been home from my mission for forty-one years now, and a day has not gone by that I have not been blessed because of my mission. The mission only lasted two years, but forty years later it has not dimmed with time. If it only brought salvation to one soul--mine--it was worth it.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 84 shares some insights into what we can expect as blessings from the Lord start to flow into our lives:<br><br><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i><br><br><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i><br><br><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:33–38]<br><br>All the Father hath--what more is there?<br><br>Again from Doctrine and Covenants 4, in verse 2, we read:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i><br><br>If you serve God with "all your heart, might, mind and strength," you can stand before God blameless at the last day. Let me submit to you that the last day can be the last day of your mission or the last day of any calling you might receive. That great and last day is going to be glorious if, on the last day of every calling, you have served the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I remember coming home off my mission and thinking I had served with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. Now I wasn't the shiniest candy in the bowl during my mission, but I did the best I could, and I have tried to do the same thing with every calling I have received since.<br><h2><b>4. Money Management</b></h2><br>The final M&amp;amp;M is for<b>money management.</b>It is not the most critical factor in determining a mission, but it can define and definitely be mind consuming. Any young person who comes with the desire to serve a mission can definitely find funding. But don't take it for granted. I think the Lord expects us to do all we can to prepare financially and not leave it up to someone else.<br><br>When I started working for Snow College in 1983, we had taken a big cut in pay to move home. We about starved that first year, but we came up with a plan for saving for our kids' missions. Our first two children were girls, and then the next five were boys. We always planned on the boys going on missions, so we saved a little bit each month for their missions, and we also had a plan to have our home paid off by the time they started to serve.<br><br>When my second daughter said she would like to serve a mission, it was at the same time my oldest son was getting ready for his mission. They both received their mission calls the same day. My daughter entered the MTC two weeks before my son, and they were in the MTC at the same time. Daina went to Mexico City and Phillip went to Kiev, Ukraine. We had the money for Phillip, but we didn't have a dime for Daina.<br><br>From the week before Daina entered the MTC to her last week in the mission field, we did not pay a full mission payment for her. It was amazing. People would come up to us and say, "You need this more than I do," and a couple of businesses in Mount Pleasant paid a full mission payment four or five times. Even my parents stepped up. Daina's mission was completely paid for this way.<br><br>When Daina got home I thought we were going to get rich off these missions. Not one more dime ever came in, but what a blessing those donations were. I can't help but feel it was because we had planned and saved for many years, and the Lord did the rest of what we couldn't do.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Missionary work is exactly what it is: hard, scary, consuming, exciting, fulfilling, and many other words.<br><br>However, just like the candy M&amp;amp;M's come in so many colors but all taste the same, missionary work looks different for every person but all leads to the same thing--bringing souls unto Christ. You can come up with your own M&amp;amp;M's, and I'm sure there are a lot more<i>M</i>words out there that can represent ­missionary-minded members. It still all comes down to the work of the Savior.<br><br><b>M</b>iraculous conversion--just a simple prayer.<br><br><b>M</b>arvelous work and a wonder--the Book of Mormon, such a great cause.<br><br><b>M</b>agnify--all the Father has.<br><br><b>M</b>oney management--knowing whose work this really is.<br><br>I know God lives. This is His great plan of happiness that the world needs. I know that God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The fruits are before you. I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the prophet today and that this is the Savior's kingdom upon the earth with an eternal mission to accomplish.<br><br>Now that I am getting closer to going on a mission again, I find that my wife and I are challenged with the same issues and the same concerns about a mission that I had when I was seventeen years old. But now I know. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gary E.

<h1>n Body: A Gift and a Responsibility - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During a special Council in Heaven, our Heavenly Father announced His divine plan--the great plan of happiness. The purpose of the plan was to provide an opportunity for His spirit children to "obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection."<sup>1</sup>We were so excited to learn about our Father's plan that we "shouted for joy."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Why were we so happy to learn about Heavenly Father's wonderful plan? It was partly because our heavenly parents have glorified bodies of flesh and bones. For us to become like Them and to receive a fullness of joy, we knew that our celestial spirits had to be united with physical bodies--bodies created in the image of God.<br><br>I grew up outside of the Church. As a youngster I was taught that God is a bodiless spirit who fills the universe. He is everywhere, yet He can dwell in my heart. So when I first learned that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are two distinct beings and that each has a perfected physical body, I was overjoyed. My testimony grew rapidly once I had an accurate understanding of the Godhead. Brothers and sisters, I love Heavenly Father, and I testify that Jesus Christ is His Son and our Savior.<br><br>In the premortal world we learned that our earthly experience would be challenging. Our bodies would be subject to disease, pain, and temptation. Some of us would have significant disabilities while others would have to live in hostile environments. Despite these hardships, each one of us accepted the invitation to leave our heavenly home, receive a physical body, and do our best to overcome the natural man.<br><br>Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the Celestial Kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The Devil has no body, and herein is his punishment.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>So Satan and his followers were punished and we were blessed--blessed with tabernacles of flesh. We are each privileged to have a body. It is a special gift from God. Of all the creations of the Almighty, there is nothing more holy and magnificent than the human body. Worlds without number He has created, yet man and woman are His finest masterpieces.<br><br>Scientists have been studying the intricacies of the human body for centuries. The more we learn, the more we feel awe and admiration. The body is truly miraculous. Just a few months ago my youngest son and his wife had their first baby--a boy. He is beautiful in every way. Whenever I hold him, I can sense holiness about him. His fingers and toes are so tiny. He has a cute little dimple when he smiles. His eyes are already sending a steady stream of data to his brain, which is quickly learning to interpret the infinite images before him. His little heart pumps rhythmically to move blood to every cell of his body. Over the next eighty years his heart will beat more than three billion times.<sup>4</sup>What a remarkable creation!<br><br>The scriptures tell us that our bodies are temples. In the New Testament, while confronting those who were treating His Father's house as a store, Jesus referred to His body as a temple. Later, while speaking to the people of Corinth, the Apostle Paul announced, "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" He then declared, "For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, do we treat our bodies as temples? In the early Church the Saints sacrificed tremendously to build and care for their temples. They gave much of what they had in order to build the best for the Lord. Today the Church invests substantially in the temples it builds. Each is a special house of the Lord. Only high-quality materials and the finest craftsmen are used to construct temples. Temple grounds are landscaped with beautiful flowers and trees. Often there is a fountain. Special care is devoted to keeping our temples clean and in excellent condition. Why? Because they are sacred structures.<br><br>Elder Paul B. Pieper of the Quorum of the Seventy said:<br><br><i><b>Sacred</b>means worthy of veneration and respect. By designating something as sacred, the Lord signals that it is of higher value and priority than other things. Sacred things are to be treated with more care, given greater deference, and regarded with deeper reverence.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Temples are sacred. The human body is sacred. It follows that our bodies should be given higher priority and more care than other things.<br><br>Elder Pieper continued: "That which is sacred to God becomes sacred to us only through the exercise of agency; each must choose to accept and hold sacred that which God has defined as sacred."<sup>7</sup>Our bodies are holy in the Lord's eyes. Do we see our bodies as sacred or merely as an object that we have to put up with?<br><br>As a professor I spend much of my time studying how we can best care for our bodies--what we need to do to keep them healthy and fit. Because our bodies are special gifts, they deserve special care. In today's world it is common for some--even for members of the Church--to rationalize that they do not have time to care for their bodies. They give little thought to the food they consume and view exercise as an activity only for athletes. Can you imagine how the Lord would feel if one of His holy temples were neglected because it was viewed as insignificant or not worth the effort?<br><br>The Lord understands everything about the human body. He created it. He knows how to make it healthy and what causes it to weaken and die. As He demonstrated with the Three Nephites<sup>8</sup>and with John the Beloved,<sup>9</sup>if He desires He can modify the physical tabernacle so that it will not get sick or die. Science is a long way from those discoveries, but, gradually, through research and the Lord's inspiration, we are learning how to best nourish, exercise, and repair the body.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 130 we learn that if we want the blessings of good health, we have to obey certain laws. I love verses 20 and 21:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i><br><br>Notice that<i>all</i>blessings are predicated on obedience to certain laws. Blessings--and, for that matter, negative consequences--do not occur randomly. Natural laws govern all aspects of the universe, including how the human body functions. These laws are eternal and unchanging. They are "truths." I find it fascinating to watch as new discoveries are made regularly, helping us better understand the eternal truths that govern all that we as humans know and have yet to learn.<br><br>We now know that much of good health and disease is determined by living or not living certain laws. We do not know all the truths that govern the human body, but we do know markedly more than we did just fifty years ago. It was only about fifty years ago, in 1964, that the Surgeon General of the United States officially declared that cigarette smoking is hazardous to health.<sup>10</sup>Of course members of the Church had inside information from the Lord, who revealed this law to His Saints roughly 130 years before the Surgeon General shared it with the country.<sup>11</sup>It is exciting to think about the laws governing health and disease that will be discovered over the next fifty years. Before long I expect scientists will be growing customized hearts, hips, and hair. I need to get on a waiting list for the latter.<br><br>I love to get up in the morning and go to work to study the laws that govern human health and disease. These laws are intriguing to me. As Church members we are greatly blessed to have some of the most important and basic laws of health in the Word of Wisdom. I fear that many Church members underestimate the value of the Word of Wisdom. These truths are not all-inclusive, but there are many wonderful laws of health contained within the twenty-one verses of Doctrine and Covenants 89. Given that these truths were revealed in the early 1800s, they are remarkable in their coverage and accuracy. However, there is a catch. We must obey the laws to receive the blessings.<br><br>The Word of Wisdom is loaded with wonderful counsel and powerful warnings designed to bless our bodies and our spirits. Because we have been told that "tobacco is not for the body,"<sup>12</sup>members of the Church have avoided countless serious diseases and premature deaths. Since the original Surgeon General report on smoking, more than 12 million Americans have died prematurely because they smoked.<sup>13</sup>If we did not have the Word of Wisdom, tens of thousands of Church members would suffer the horrors of tobacco use just like the rest of the world.<br><br>Let me share with you a personal story. My father was in World War II. He was not a member of the Church. Cigarettes were given to soldiers as part of their rations back in those days. As a result he and untold other young men became smokers. Keep in mind that the ills of smoking would not be known by the public for another twenty years. In fact, smoking was promoted as a healthy practice. In short, he did not know better. But here is the key: he smoked, and, as you would expect, natural laws govern smoking. Fortunately, when science determined that smoking was unhealthy, my dad quit. But while he was a smoker, natural laws could not be cheated, and his precious temple was damaged. The Lord blesses those who learn His will and follow His commandments. I testify that He loves us, and we are greatly blessed because we have known for over a century that "tobacco is not for the body."<br><br>Smoking is not a temptation to most of us. It is clearly hazardous, and we have a commandment to not smoke. But what about exercise and physical fitness? This may surprise you. Adults who smoke have a death rate that is about two times higher than nonsmokers,<sup>14</sup>but those who are unfit have a death rate that is about four times higher than those who are fit.<sup>15</sup>That is amazing. Everyone knows that smoking is dangerous, but few are aware of the hazards of being unfit and the protection afforded those who are fit. My objective is not to minimize the risks of smoking but to emphasize the value of becoming fit to protect our wonderful temples.<br><br>Millions of Americans drink alcohol, but the Word of Wisdom instructs us not to. This confuses some because research indicates that alcohol has some benefits.<sup>16</sup>But here is the crucial point: the negative consequences of alcohol use far outweigh the positive. The Lord, in His infinite wisdom, knows where to draw the line. Alcohol is a powerful drug--an addictive drug. When consumed, inhibitions are reduced. In other words, under the influence of alcohol, people do things they would not normally do. Many think that alcohol use is fun, but we cannot drink and have the Spirit. We cannot drink and have full control of our thoughts and actions. Consequently, alcohol use is strongly linked to higher rates of suicide, spouse and child abuse, fatal car accidents, rape, job loss, and crimes such as robbery and assault.<sup>17</sup>Alcohol use has some benefits, but the costs are too great.<br><br>Although I grew up outside of the Church, I have never had a drink of alcohol. As a high school athlete I was pressured to drink after games, but something inside of me gave me strength to never drink alcohol. Two of my best friends in high school were killed in separate accidents because they drank and drove. Even more traumatic, several of my close relatives were alcoholics. It was horrible to watch alcohol destroy them. The Lord in His mercy has saved us much misery by giving us the commandment to not drink alcohol.<br><br>As we know, the Word of Wisdom contains much more than counsel to not smoke or drink. It also encourages us to eat healthy foods, especially plants. Doctrine and Covenants 89:10–11 states:<br><br><i>All wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man--</i><br><br><i>Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.</i><br><br>Herbs are plants. Research shows that fruits and vegetables are especially good for us.<sup>18</sup>Most adults eat only a small fraction of the recommended servings. Remember, we have to live the law to receive the blessing. Similarly, in verse 12 we are encouraged to eat meat sparingly. I testify that the Lord wants to bless us. That is why He gave us the Word of Wisdom. If we will follow His counsel, we will have better health, less suffering, and longer lives.<br><br>Natural laws dictate the consequences of our choices--all of them. If we understood all the laws of the universe, we could explain all the consequences. However, we currently know only a small percentage of the laws. Some are simple: When we fall off a ladder, there are obvious, immediate consequences. When we eat unhealthy food, there are also immediate consequences, but they are not as obvious. At the cellular level, damage occurs. Specialized equipment is needed to observe these acute changes, so they go unnoticed--at least for a time. When we engage in exercise, like brisk walking, there are dozens of benefits. We know this because research has identified the laws that govern the effects of exercise on the body. In short, our day-to-day choices have significant consequences on the body. Even if we do not know the science behind the effects, the consequences still occur day by day, month by month, and year by year.<br><br>Hundreds of scientific studies illustrate the concept that our day-to-day behaviors have important effects on our health. A classic investigation is the Nurses' Health Study.<sup>19</sup>It included more than 84,000 women who were tracked for fourteen years by Harvard researchers. Results showed that 82 percent of all the heart attacks and strokes that occurred in the sample could be attributed to just five lifestyle factors--five choices: smoking, obesity, physical activity, alcohol use, and diet. More than eight of every ten heart attacks and strokes that occurred during the fourteen years could be accounted for by those five choices--not genetics, not environment, not education: just lifestyle. Without question the day-to-day care we give our bodies makes a tremendous difference in our health.<br><br>The effects of abiding by spiritual laws are typically gradual, line upon line. If we miss our morning prayer or skip our daily scripture study, there are consequences. We may not notice any change, but we will be different, ever so slightly. Fortunately we do not lose our testimonies in a day. If we miss another day, the effects are more significant, but we still may not notice any difference. Slowly but surely our testimonies grow or deteriorate based on the extent to which we nourish them. Over time the consequences of what seem to be insignificant choices accumulate, and we become who we now are.<br><br>The same is true regarding our lifestyle decisions and the health of our bodies. Line upon line, day by day, our bodies change ever so slightly based on what we eat, the extent to which we exercise, whether or not we smoke, and other important choices. The daily consequences appear insignificant, but when summed together the effects are amazing--often dictating the diseases we develop, how long we live, and the quality of our lives.<br><br>While walking the roads of Palestine, Jesus encouraged others to follow Him. We will also be blessed if we follow His footsteps. Because He was not denied agency, He could choose for Himself. Christ chose to live a life of sacrifice. He displayed remarkable self-control. He learned at an early age to do what is right and let the blessings follow. To care for our temples, we too must learn self-control. If there were no consequences, most of us would rather eat a cookie than a carrot or be entertained rather than exercise. However, we often have to sacrifice today to earn the richest blessings tomorrow. It may take more than a lifetime to learn to master the flesh as Christ did, but the Lord expects us to do our best and to keep trying.<br><br>Balance is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Our bodies need daily exercise and a healthy diet, but we can overdo. Remember, the Lord's piano has a full keyboard, and the best music is played using a variety of keys, not by pounding on just one or two. The Lord is pleased when His Saints are fit, not fanatical. On the other hand, in our culture the tendency is to underdo. Doing too little or too much can cause us to lose choice blessings.<br><br>Extremists often have distorted views of the body. Some despise their bodies, even inflicting intentional damage. Others worship their bodies, focusing excessively on physical appearance. In each case the body is seen merely as an object. I testify that these are not righteous views. The human body is a gift from God--a temple--to be treated with thankfulness and respect, not despised or worshiped.<br><br>As wonderful and miraculous as our bodies are, they have limitations. They wear out. Because of the Fall they are subject to disease and eventual death. It is part of the plan. But keep in mind, bodies that are neglected wear out long before those that receive good care. We all have work to do here on the earth--important missions to accomplish. If we cut corners regarding the maintenance of our temples, we may not finish our earthly assignments before our bodies fail.<br><br>Some rewards in life require special talents, but that is not the case for good health. Developing a healthy lifestyle simply requires the right attitude, hard work, and self-discipline. After all, how skilled do we have to be to walk a few miles each day? The path to good health is not without challenges, but the rewards are not limited to a special few who have exceptional abilities. The Lord wants all of us to enjoy good health, so He designed a body that can be kept in good condition with minimal talent.<br><br>Are all health problems the consequence of our behaviors and our day-to-day choices? Definitely not. Although research clearly shows that a large percentage of the major killers can be attributed to our lifestyles, some health problems have nothing to do with the choices we make. Our day-to-day decisions are paramount, but the choices of others can greatly affect our lives. For example, when I was a young boy a drunk driver nearly killed me and my parents. My dad, who was driving, did not do anything wrong, nor did my mother who was in the seat beside him. I was in the back. Without warning a truck driven by a drunk man smashed into our car at high speed. The forces were incredible. There was broken glass and torn metal everywhere. Our car was demolished. Cars did not have air bags in those days, but they had seat belts, and my parents and I each had one on. Our car was destroyed, but we were not seriously hurt.<br><br>Our lives were almost taken in just a few seconds. We had done nothing wrong. Clearly, health problems and premature death are not always a result of our choices. Sometimes they are the result of the choices of others. Our environment, genetics, and other factors can also play important roles.<br><br>In John 9:1–3 we read:<br><br><i>And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</i><br><br><i>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</i><br><br>In this story the blind man had done nothing to cause his disability, and his parents were innocent as well. We all know people like this man--perhaps not blind but disabled or diseased in some way. No doubt such circumstances can be difficult. Frequently individuals with such challenges are spiritually mature and holy. They have endured much. Often their rough edges have been worn away and their spirits have been polished by the grind of hardship. Sometimes the elect are required to endure the most, such as Joseph Smith, Job, and Jesus Christ. Our challenge is to endure, no matter what our circumstances are.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the human body is a magnificent gift and a significant responsibility. It is our Master's finest creation. We are more like our heavenly parents--not less--because we have bodies. Our bodies are sacred temples, worthy of special care and respect. Sacrifice is required to keep our temples in good condition. Do not give up. A fit body is a righteous desire. I testify that if we will turn to the Lord and call upon Him, He will help us, but He will not circumvent our agency. With the right attitude and the Lord at our side, we can learn to live a healthy lifestyle, which will enable us to more fully participate in life and enjoy its blessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry A. Tucker was a BYU professor of exercise sciences when this devotional address was given 28May 2013.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>tional: &quot;Wandering and Wondering&quot; by Kelly D. Patterson</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to thank BYU for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today. I have had the amazing privilege of teaching at this wonderful university for almost twenty years. I love BYU and what it has meant for my family, my students, and me. Indeed, I would like to thank my family, my colleagues, and my students--but especially my family. I love you all very much. You have made this experience one of joy and happiness for me.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about wandering and wondering. The topic of this devotional has been percolating in my mind for a while. Steven Knott, who is bishop of the Tenth Ward in the Salt Lake Married Student Second Stake, asked me to speak to his ward about faith. He was concerned about the challenges being posed to the faith of some of the members. He did not want me to speak about the concept of faith, per se, but about those elements of our modern culture that challenge faith. Today I hope to expand a little upon the ideas I discussed with those remarkable students that day.<br><h2><b>Faith and Reason</b></h2><br>Let me start out with a little bit of a disclaimer. What we are going to talk about today is one way to address these issues, not the only way. Many of you will never struggle with issues of faith, but some of you might. There are a variety of ways to approach these issues, and I am really only talking about the way in which I have attempted to play with them. I use the word<i>play</i>intentionally.<i>Play</i>implies spontaneity or seeing something afresh. Reflecting about and deepening faith is quite enjoyable and rewarding. Much like play, it can also refresh and revive you so that you can continue your many other responsibilities with more insight and vigor.<br><br>But learning about and living with faith is a personal journey. I expect that many of you will and should approach these issues somewhat differently than I have. What I hope you understand is that they can be addressed and that you can take what is beautiful and true about the gospel of Jesus Christ and live in a world that is not always friendly to faith. Tensions do exist between your faith and some of the norms of the world, but it certainly seems possible to find a balance between the two demands. To put it bluntly, you can know that Jesus is the Christ and that He restored His gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith while at the same time immersing yourself in the wonders of the humanities, the social sciences, the sciences, and other disciplines of knowledge.<br><br>The dichotomy between faith and reason that is so popular today is in some respects a product of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the thinkers of the Enlightenment sought to attack organized religion as a means of loosening its grip on society. Enlightenment thinkers, such as the most ardent proponents of the French Revolution, launched an all-out war on religion because it stood in the way of the thorough remaking of society that they envisioned. In the process, a caricature of religion emerged that, to some extent, has persisted to this day.<br><br>What I hope you will understand is that seeing reason and faith as incompatible necessarily distorts both reason and faith. Indeed, the sooner you reject this false dichotomy, the quicker you can get started with the business of developing the full range of talents and abilities that will make you so valuable in the Lord's kingdom.<br><h2><b>Two Models</b></h2><br>So often all we see are these two mutually exclusive alternatives. However, there are often other ways to approach a question or problem. Let me illustrate this with a story.<br><br>I like to run, and there is a small group of runners here at BYU, with a branch in Salt Lake City, that we call the 8-Minute Gang. We have run all over this state together and have participated in several races. The first marathon run by one of the members of the 8-Minute Gang was the Deseret News Marathon. The Deseret News Marathon is run on July 24 in Salt Lake City and follows the route of the pioneers down Emigration Canyon. It is a brutal run--so brutal, in fact, that one member of the 8-Minute Gang simply joins us at the mouth of Emigration Canyon to carry our water on the sun-drenched Foothill section of the course. The heat saps all of your energy, and the relentless pounding of the steep, downhill course turns your quadriceps into ground beef.<br><br>On this particular day our brave runner from the 8-Minute Gang made it as far as the corner of 13th East and South Temple (three miles before the finish), at which time he pulled off the course and collapsed onto a shaded lawn. Another member of the gang and I encouraged him to get up--and to get up soon--before his legs seized up. Eventually we helped him up, and he uttered the words that now live in 8-Minute Gang lore: "I can't walk and I can't run, but I can shuffle." And shuffle he did until the finish line. Shuffling was in essence an option we hadn't considered until faced with the necessity of either dropping out or starting to run again.<br><br>Similarly, modern society most often provides us with the mutually exclusive options of being either faithful or rational. However, we have many more interesting and intriguing possibilities before us.<br><br>The Lord has furnished us with two models to help us cope with the tension we often face between faith and reason. These two models take the form of the wanderer and the wonderer. Both of these types appear prominently in our scriptures and provide us postures we ought to consider assuming as we confront the challenges of living in a modern world. I want you to notice that as we combine the models of the wanderer and the wonderer, we can actually carve out another way to live in a world that often forces a contrived set of choices upon us.<br><h3><b><i>The Wanderer</i></b></h3><br>The first model is that of the wanderer. The wanderer is an individual or people who are not completely and wholly comfortable in this world. They know that this world is only a passage to another world. Consequently, these individuals never become too "at home" here in the world because they know their real home is somewhere else. Examples of wanderers abound in the scriptures. Abraham, Moses, the children of Israel, the Nephites, the Jaredites, and even our own pioneer history all emphasize wandering.<br><br>In perhaps one of the most poignant and poetic passages in the Book of Mormon, Jacob, the brother of Nephi, states:<br><br><i>I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</i>[Jacob 7:26]<br><br>This is not aimless wandering. This is a description of wandering as a separation from what is familiar or comfortable. It is a wandering designed to take the individuals or people out of the situation in which they find themselves so that the Lord can teach them the gospel and make sacred covenants with them. The wandering wrenches them out of the comforts, habits, and routines that can dull their senses and fixate their desires on the mundane. The wandering removes the residue of the world from off of them and creates openings for Heavenly Father to teach them His gospel.<br><br>We are often likened to wanderers and even admonished to act as such. It is perhaps in this vein that we could read the discourse on faith that Paul sent to the Hebrews. In Hebrews 11 Paul recounted the tremendous acts accomplished through faith and the trials suffered by those who believed. He then said in verse 38, "(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."<br><br>These were individuals who were different from the world and who resided in places that made the attractions of the world less immediate to them. We are not asked expressly to wander "in deserts, and in mountains," but we are asked not to become too comfortable here. This is not our home. It is with this type of awareness in mind that the political theorist Michael Walzer wrote, "And so the wilderness had to be a new school of the soul" (<i>Exodus and Revolution</i>[New York: Basic Books, 1985], 53). Wandering on this earth for our appointed time is our "school of the soul."<br><h3><b><i>The Wonderer</i></b></h3><br>However, we can only learn from this school if we take the initiative to enroll and to reflect on the meaning and splendor of its lessons. The model of the wanderer is not sufficient by itself. For this reason the second model is that of the wonderer. Here also we have numerous examples after which to pattern our lives: Adam, Lehi, Nephi, the apostles John and Paul, and the Prophet Joseph Smith. But perhaps the example I love the most comes from the consummate wanderer and wonderer: Moses. Moses established his credentials as a wonderer early. In the Pearl of Great Price we have the account of Moses' grand vision. There are two critical parts in this vision that apply to the idea of wonder.<br><br>Moses' reflections produced this perceptive phrase: "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). To have a deep sense of wonder, we must recognize the limits to our own understanding. So often we are quick to think that we already understand how the world works. Moses' realization that "man is nothing" made it possible for him to make real progress. He did not start with the assurance of what he thought he already knew but with the understanding that there is much more to learn from a source that seems to have so much more wisdom and knowledge than he had previously thought possible or understood.<br><br>What did Moses do with this enriched understanding? The answer appears in Moses 1:30, when Moses seized the full import of his new understanding and asked the questions that go to the very heart of wonder. This verse states: "And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying: Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them?"<br><br>Once again these two questions are at the center of wondering. When we stare up at the night sky and see the brilliance of the stars or when we hold a baby in our arms for the very first time or when we contemplate on the death of a loved one, we cannot help but wonder why these things are so and by what they were made. These two questions form the core of all human wondering and questioning up to our present day.<br><h2><b>Becoming Wanderers and Wonderers</b></h2><br>So what does wandering and wondering do for you? What sorts of perspectives should a productive merging of these two postures impart to you?<br><h3><b><i>Seek Intelligence</i></b></h3><br>First, you should acknowledge that the gospel of Jesus Christ does not--and this I must emphatically say<i>does not--</i>require you to check your intelligence at the door. Think of what the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote during his imprisonment in Liberty Jail:<br><br><i>The things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity--thou must commune with God. How much more dignified and noble are the thoughts of God, than the vain imaginations of the human heart! None but fools will trifle with the souls of men.</i>[<i>HC</i>3:295; letter, 25 March 1839]<br><br>You cannot contemplate "the things of God" without some distance between you and the world and without a stance of wonder and awe. Furthermore, we do not shy away from the hard work of thinking and contemplating. It is not our heritage. Parley P. Pratt, B. H. Roberts, and literally hundreds of others have pushed us as a people in our short history to think and to think profoundly.<br><br>My Grandfather Patterson was a missionary in the Eastern States Mission in 1927 when Elder B. H. Roberts was president of that mission. Elder Roberts had an intensive six-week school with which he prepared his missionaries for the rigors of missionary life. Elder Roberts cared deeply about his missionaries and wanted them to develop the spiritual, intellectual, and physical gifts that would help them succeed. He pushed them very hard to think about the gospel and to develop the ability to preach it and defend it. My grandfather recorded in his journal what I think is the essence of the work required of us to learn the gospel. On January 17, 1927, he wrote:<br><br><i>School started out as per schedule and we have been following the schedule all week, and it certainly put one's nerves on edge, for my head has felt like a boiler factory. But it was worth it just to hear Pres. Roberts talk.</i><br><br>The next day, January 18, he recorded: "School went along as schedule[d], even if my head did hurt."<br><br>January 19: "School as usual. Head still hurting."<br><br>January 20: "School as usual. Head still hurting."<br><br>Now, lest you think this ends with my grandfather's head exploding, he recorded on January 21, "Just had school till noon, had the rest of [the day] to catch up on our loafing."<br><br>We can and should do the hard work of thinking and engaging with those who have considered similar questions within the academic disciplines; it is part of the charm of wondering. When it comes to doing the hard thinking, though, Latter-day Saints start from the premise that there is more than just knowledge to be gained. Latter-day Saints, with their stance as wanderers, know that there is a reality beyond the present that gives thinking and questioning a genuine purpose. The Book of Mormon states in 2 Nephi 9:28–29:<br><br><i>When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><br><h3><b><i>Value Gospel Insights</i></b></h3><br>There is a second perspective we gain as we blend the stances of wanderer and wonderer. As you encounter the secular world, you will hear representations made against religion, God, communities of believers, and many other aspects of faith. As you encounter such representations, your stance as a wanderer and a wonderer should already have prepared you to scrutinize carefully the assumptions of those who make only the worst representations about faith. As a wanderer, you should not feel completely at home with the fads and trends in thinking that you see in the world. You should already have some misgivings about them. As somebody committed to wonder, you can continuously pursue knowledge about the heavens and gain insights and understanding that many in the world choose never to achieve.<br><br>For example, how many individuals do you know who get tripped up on the idea of evil or why bad things happen to good people? Many of the current negative representations of religion make assumptions about God, nature, and the heavens that students and followers of the restored gospel do not make. The idea of premortal existence and the choice that we made to come to earth and learn how to make and keep covenants provides us with a perspective on evil that most people simply ignore. Our gospel-aided insights do not keep us from being sad at the presence of evil, but they do help us to see that it is not completely and utterly senseless and cruel of our Heavenly Father to have put us here.<br><h3><b><i>Be Careful in Your Assumptions</i></b></h3><br>Third, wandering and wondering should also make you careful about the assumptions<i>you</i>entertain about your own faith. The assumptions that lurk in the background of your thinking exercise a powerful influence, and if you are not careful and self-reflective, they may sometimes guide you to the wrong place. Seeing yourself as a wanderer humbles you and helps you avoid turning your own ideas into idols. Wandering brings with it meekness, and wonder supplies the enthusiasm to call upon your Heavenly Father as you seek to understand Him and His plan.<br><br>For example, when you hear the word<i>prophet,</i>what are the descriptions that jump into your mind and shape your judgments? How many of you think that the Lord was constantly holding onto the Prophet Joseph Smith's elbow and whispering into his ear during his waking and even his sleeping hours? If your standard assumptions or understanding of a prophet--or any Church leader, for that matter--are more rigorous than what the Lord expects, then you set yourself up for disappointment and maybe even anger. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland said in the April 2013 general conference:<br><br><i>Be kind regarding human frailty--your own as well as that of those who serve with you in a Church led by volunteer, mortal men and women. Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we. And when you see imperfection, remember that the limitation is<b>not</b>in the divinity of the work.</i>["Lord, I Believe,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2013, 94; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Looking with Wonder to Our True Home</b></h2><br>There is much that we can gain from adopting the stances of a wanderer and a wonderer. As wanderers we gain a critical perspective on the categories of thinking that pervade a world that seems increasingly hostile toward faith. As wonderers we embrace the beauty and mysteries of our journey here and fulfill the design of the Thirteenth Article of Faith: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." We<i>seek</i>after knowledge, gifts, and wisdom because, according to Brigham Young, "We are trying to be the image of those who live in heaven; we are trying to pattern after them, to look like them, to walk and talk like them" (<i>JD</i>9:170).<br><br>These are indeed lofty aspirations, and they are the aspirations of the wanderer and the wonderer--the person who is not at home here but who wonders often about this home and the destination to which he can be fitted.<br><br>The late Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>The restored gospel is buoyant, wide, and deep--beyond our comprehension. It edifies, whether concerning divine design in the universe or stressing the importance of personal chastity and fidelity. Only meek disciples can safely handle such a bold theology.</i>["Encircled in the Arms of His Love,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 16]<br><br>We can repurpose the tension between the world and such a "bold theology" by taking the best of what the wanderer and the wonderer have to offer us. We can creatively use the examples of wandering and wondering to blaze a reliable and exhilarating path back into the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I leave you with my testimony of the beauty and truth of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Kelly D.

<h1>n the Lord&#039;s Side - Brian Santiago - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a young boy (I still think of myself as young), I grew up on the east side of Provo. Surrounded by the mountains, Rock Canyon, the Provo River, and Utah Lake, I often heard stories about "the greatest lake ever": Lake Powell. Friends, classmates, teachers, neighbors, and pretty much every person I knew would relate stories of water skiing, cliff jumping, houseboats, jet skis, sunshine, and good food. I wondered if I would ever have the chance to visit. The years passed by--junior high school, high school, a mission, college, graduate school--and still no opportunity came.<br><br>In the summer of 2001 the stars began to align. A trip was planned, and I was included! To ensure my attendance, I volunteered to drive and bring a couple of people with me. With much anticipation, my wife, Kimberly, and I, along with a couple of others, headed south for the six-hour drive to Wahweap Marina--getting started an hour later than we had planned. As we drove the long, straight drive approaching Wahweap, the red-rock cliffs and their beauty were apparent, enhanced by a beautiful sunset. It was hard to contain my excitement.<br><br>Arrangements had been made for Dave Rose, a colleague of mine on the basketball staff and a veteran boat operator, to pick us up at the dock and transport us to a houseboat located on the lake a few miles from the dock. As planned, he and his daughter Channell were waiting, and we loaded the boat. The sun had set, and the only light and sense of direction were from the brilliant moon in the sky. With some hesitation (veteran boat operators don't often show all of their concerns and fears) the boat was launched, and we headed for paradise.<br><br>Knowing the lake, Dave set a path toward the canyon where the houseboat was located, led only by the light of the moon. Within minutes of our departure it became apparent that a storm was upon us. Dark clouds covered the sky, the moonlight disappeared, and blinding rain and waves rocked the boat. I now understood Dave's hesitancy prior to our departure from the dock. The thought kept coming to my mind, "<i>This</i>is what Lake Powell is all about?" In that moment I was not that impressed.<br><br>Multiple prayers ensued as we pressed on, fighting the storm. Suddenly we slammed into a sandbar, seizing the engine! The waves pounded the boat, with each passing wave pressing us harder against the sand. Dave yelled for his daughter to jump out onto the sand to push us back into the raging waters. Her strength, to this day, is an inspiration and a miracle. She successfully pushed us against the waves and current back into the lake. The engine started, and we pressed on toward the houseboat. Fear stricken, we prayed for calm waters so we could arrive at our destination safely. Within minutes the storm blew on, the moon reappeared, and Dave was able to deliver us safely, albeit wet, freezing cold, scared, and wide eyed--and still wondering what the buzz of Lake Powell was all about.<br><br>The next morning I awoke to one of most breathtaking places on planet earth: crystal clear water surrounded by red-rock cliffs, pure sand, and a perfect blue sky with abundant sunshine. A place that in my opinion could be added to the seven natural wonders of the world, Lake Powell was better than I had expected.<br><br>That experience has proven to be a metaphor for our journey through life. We must pass and press forward through the storms of life to find the calm, reassuring peace that comes from being safely on the Lord's side. My experience at Lake Powell brings to mind the words of one of my favorite hymns, "Master, the Tempest Is Raging":<br><br><i>Master, the tempest is raging!<br></i><i>The billows are tossing high!<br>The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness.<br>No shelter or help is nigh.<br>Carest thou not that we perish?<br>How canst thou lie asleep<br>When each moment so madly is threat'ning<br>A grave in the angry deep?</i><br><br><i>Master, with anguish of spirit I bow in my grief today.<br>The depths of my sad heart are troubled.<br>Oh, waken and save, I pray!<br>Torrents of sin and of anguish<br>Sweep o'er my sinking soul,<br>And I perish! I perish! dear Master.<br>Oh, hasten and take control!</i><br><br><i>(Chorus)<br>The winds and the waves shall obey thy will:<br>Peace, be still.<br>Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea<br>Or demons or men or whatever it be,<br>No waters can swallow the ship where lies<br>The Master of ocean and earth and skies.<br>They all shall sweetly obey thy will:<br>Peace, be still; peace, be still.<br>They all shall sweetly obey thy will:<br>Peace, peace, be still.</i><br><br><i>Master, the terror is over.<br>The elements sweetly rest.<br>Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,<br>And heaven's within my breast.<br>Linger, O blessed Redeemer!<br>Leave me alone no more,<br>And with joy I shall make the blest harbor<br>And rest on the blissful shore.</i><br>["Master, the Tempest Is Raging,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 105]<br><br>We have a choice to make as we navigate life and the path back to a loving Heavenly Father who longs for our return.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Alma taught, "Therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God" (Alma 12:24). Our choice is whether or not we want to be safely on the Lord's side. Every one of us faces adversity, trials, and the storms of life. Today I want to propose three areas that can help deliver us back into the outstretched arms of the Savior:<br><br>1. Being at peace with God through our personal integrity<br>2. Following the promptings of the Holy Ghost<br>3. Perseverance<br><h2><strong>Personal Integrity</strong></h2><br>It has been my experience in life that there are few feelings that rival being at peace with the Savior, which comes as a result of our willingness to be totally honest with Him. A recent story shared in general conference by Sister Ann M. Dibb illustrates this point:<br><br><i>A man . . . went one evening to steal corn from a neighbor's field. He took his little boy with him to sit on the fence and keep a look-out, so as to give warning in case any one should come along. The man jumped over the fence with a large bag on his arm, and before commencing to take the corn he looked all around, first one way and then the other, and not seeing any person, he was just about to fill his bag. Then the little fellow, his son, . . . cried out:</i><br><br><i>"Father, there is one way you haven't looked yet! . . .</i><br><br><i>". . . You forgot to look up."</i>["Forgot to Look Up," Salmagundi,<i>Scott's Monthly Magazine</i>4, no. 6 (December 1867): 953; quoted in Dibb, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/i-believe-in-being-honest-and-true?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Believe in Being Honest and True</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2011, 116]<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, "Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart" (D&amp;amp;C 6:16).<br><br>The adversary teaches us to hide, and when we make mistakes it is our human nature to hide! Who are we hiding from? We win when we are honest with our fellowmen, ourselves, and God. An experience we had while hiring one of our head coaches in the Athletic Department illustrates this point. With permission from Carrie Summerhays Roberts, I share this experience.<br><br>Our athletic director, Tom Holmoe, and I had completed the interviews with our final two candidates for the position of head women's golf coach. We had two excellent and very well-qualified candidates who were both passionate about getting the job. It seemed like we could not go wrong with either choice, but we had a tough decision to make in determining who was the best fit.<br><br>We searched for something to differentiate the two and kept coming up empty, until a meeting with Carrie provided the answer.<br><br>Carrie and I met in my office, where we again discussed in detail the job responsibilities, answered her questions, and then proceeded to finish the meeting. As she started to leave my office, she turned around and told me she needed to share something personal with me. She proceeded to tell me that she wanted to be totally honest with me, against the recommendation of many who had advised her not to tell for fear it may cost her the job. She then told me that she was expecting a child. I responded by telling her how much I appreciated her being honest and straightforward, because it was crucial for us to plan summer recruiting and prepare for the fall season. She left my office certainly at peace that she had been totally honest but also wondering if that disclosure of information had just cost her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<br><br>After she disappeared down the hallway, I walked to Tom's office, knocked on the door, and expressed to him that we had found our coach. She had just provided us the reassurance that we would not have to worry about how she would lead the golf program. Her demonstration of integrity made all the difference in the world, and shortly thereafter she was offered the job, which she accepted. I am reminded of a quote from Elder Tad R. Callister's devotional address:<br><br><i>May the integrity of our souls have a sign that reads in bold, black letters "NOT FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE" so that it might be said of us, as it was of Hyrum Smith, "Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:15].<br><br>Elder Callister continued: <i>May we all become men and women of integrity--not because we have to but because we want to. The Lord announced the reward for those who do so: "Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest . . . and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice . . .<strong>they are accepted of me"</strong></i>[D&amp;amp;C 97:8]. ["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tad-r-callister_becoming-men-and-women-of-integrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becoming Men and Women of Integrity</a>," BYU devotional address, 6 December 2011; emphasis in original]<br><h2><strong>Following the Promptings of the Holy Ghost</strong></h2><br>Living our lives with integrity before the Lord allows us to stand with confidence and provides an avenue for the Holy Ghost to lead and guide us through our lives.<br><br>The Savior gave us this promise:<br><br><i>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</i><br><br><i>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</i><br><br><i>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. . . .</i><br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i>[John 14:16–18; 26]<br><br>What an incredible promise and blessing to live our lives with the promise of having the Holy Ghost<i>with us!</i>Since I am sure many of you have had experiences with the promptings of the Holy Ghost leading you away from danger to safety, I would like to share a personal one with you.<br><br>A few years ago I was excited to attend the NCAA Track and Field Championships with our men's and women's track teams. I had been newly assigned to oversee the programs and looked forward to watching our teams and individual student athletes compete for a national championship at Sacramento State University. I arrived in Sacramento, California, where a staff member picked me up at the airport and shuttled me to the Marriott Courtyard next to the UC Davis Medical Center.<br><br>After unpacking I went with members of the team over to the track and watched an outstanding day of competition. After spending ten-plus hours at the track with little to eat, I was anxious to return to the hotel in hopes of finding some dinner. It was late--pushing 10:00 p.m.--but I was determined. I walked outside, and, assuming I was in a safe area, started to walk, looking for any sign of nourishment. I came to the main road, and, as I looked to my left, there seemed to be some possibilities about a mile down the road. Without paying much attention, I started walking toward the lights.<br><br>After a few moments and with still a ways to go, I realized I was in a rough neighborhood and in danger. I was prompted to look behind me, and it became apparent I was being followed. I said a little prayer as I started to walk with extra pace. I had the thought to pull out my phone and to begin speaking loudly, hoping that would distract the two guys following me. I crossed the street on an angle, and while I was relieved that the two trailing me didn't cross the street, I looked ahead to see two more men walking toward me. I again raised the phone, spoke loudly, and passed by the men. They stopped and looked me over, but I was not interested to ask them what they thought.<br><br>Sheer panic had all but set in as I started a light jog toward the lights and what seemed to be a shopping center. I ran into the parking lot of the shopping center, and for some reason I wasn't hungry anymore. Scared to death, I spotted a police car parked next to the entrance of the shopping center. I approached the vehicle, and the officer was somewhat alarmed to see me coming toward him. He cracked his window as I motioned to him. I told him I was from out of town and was looking for something to eat but felt I was unsafe. He asked me where I had come from. I told him I was staying at the Marriott Courtyard at the UC Davis Medical Center. He asked me how I had gotten to the shopping center. When I told him I had walked, he told me to get in the back of his vehicle immediately. I didn't hesitate.<br><br>He told me I was lucky to be alive and was surprised that I had made it unharmed. I explained to him that I was being followed and had walked head-on into a couple of others. He asked me if they said anything to me. I explained that they had stopped and looked me up and down but that I was acting as if I was on the phone and lived close by. He said it had saved my life and the outcome could have been disastrous. Needless to say, I have never been so grateful to be dropped off at a hotel in the back of a police car--no matter how it looked to those who saw me.<br><br>It is alarming how quickly our lives can change because of the decisions we make. Every day each one of us makes choices that will determine our destiny. Simple decisions that seem insignificant at the time can have lasting effects. It is imperative that we have the companionship of the Holy Ghost to help us stay on the path of righteousness.<br><br>The Savior taught us in a revelation given in Doctrine and Covenants 11:<br><br><i>And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i>And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 11:12–14]<br><br>In 1979 Elder F. Enzio Busche shared the following:<br><br><i>It takes courage and commitment to follow the promptings of the Spirit because they may frighten us as they lead us to walk along new paths, sometimes paths that no one has walked before, paths of the second mile, of acting totally differently from how worldly people act. For instance, we may be prompted to smile when someone offends us, to give love where others give hate, to say thank you where others would not find anything to be thankful for, to accept jobs that others would be too proud to do, to apologize where others would defend themselves, and to do all the seemingly crazy things that the Spirit prompts a righteous, honest, listening heart to do.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1979/12/the-only-real-treasure?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Message: The Only Real Treasure</a>,"<i>New Era,</i>December 1979, 5]<br><h2><strong>Perseverance</strong></h2><br>President James E. Faust said, "Perseverance is demonstrated by those who keep going when the going gets tough, who don't give up even when others say, 'It can't be done'" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/05/perseverance?lang=eng&amp;amp;clang=hmo&amp;amp;country=afe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perseverance</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2005, 51).<br><br>Those words are music to my ears, because I believe that to be successful we have to be willing to do what others are unwilling to do. Above the door in my office there is a wooden plaque that my college basketball coach sent to me with the following letters: FAW NLU. It is my daily reminder to Find a Way and Never Let Up. Whether it be a small, menial task or life's biggest challenge, there is always a way to accomplish, overcome, and persevere. With the Lord at our side, we must carry on.<br><br>In late August 2010, after a long Sunday as a new bishop, I was sitting on the couch at my parents' home when news of a Mormon bishop tragically killed in Visalia, California, came across the television. Alarmed, I called out to my wife, and, to our shock and dismay, it was Clay Sannar, the brother of a close family friend. The ensuing weeks and months were difficult as family and friends rallied around Clay's wife, Julie, and their six sons. The BYU football team reached out and invited Julie and her boys to be part of their Thursday's Hero program to give them a day to remember. The team encircled the family, lifted them onto their shoulders, showered them with gifts, and boosted their spirits. It was an inspired effort to help a broken-hearted family persevere through tragedy.<br><br>A little over a year later I was on the phone with Julie. I asked her how she was doing, and her response has been an inspiration to me and to others as she carries on: "I don't know how I'm doing, but I keep rowing my boat." As Julie taught me that day, I believe the Lord will take the other oar and help us row as we navigate our path safely on the Lord's side.<br><br>Each one of us has the opportunity to join a winning team by being full of integrity, following the promptings of the Holy Ghost, and persevering through the rough waters of life. I am grateful for the Savior and testify that He lives! He knows each one of us personally and is anxiously waiting to see if we will accept His promise:<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:63]<br><br><i>For I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:88]<br><br>I pray that each one of us can find peace and comfort in knowing that the Savior of the world will help us row our boats into His outstretched arms, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brian Santiago was senior associate athletic director at BYU when this devotional address was given on 11June 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>tional: The Miracle of Repentance by D. Kelly Ogden</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is no principle of the gospel more important than repentance. At least that is what the Lord seems to be saying in the scriptures. Several times He instructed His servants to "say nothing but repentance unto this generation" (D&amp;amp;C 6:9; 11:9; see also 19:21). Does He mean that literally? Is every topic of all the missionary lessons supposed to be repentance? Does repentance have to be the subject of every Church classroom discussion? Of course not. Why did He say it that way then?<br><br>The Lord was using a figure of speech called hyperbole, which is an intentional exaggeration to emphasize a point. He said it in a hyperbolic way to stress that there is nothing more important in all the gospel than getting people to repent. This one principle is so vital that it towers above all others in primacy and urgency. Driven by faith, repentance is the single most important principle to live in order to make the Savior's Atonement effective and meaningful in our lives.<br><br>Repentance is not just feeling guilty for having sinned, nor is it mere "forgetfulness," pushing the sin way back in our mind to conveniently not be reminded of it. It is an attitude change and a behavior change. We repent not only of sins but also<i>of sinning,</i>and we are willing to do whatever is necessary to remove the stain and the pain. We turn to the Savior. He is the only one who can take away our sins because He paid the price for them.<br><h2><b>Godly Sorrow and Suffering Are Necessary</b></h2><br>In true repentance, godly sorrow and suffering are necessary. According to the scriptures, if you haven't suffered, you haven't repented. We have all been through the anguish. Sometimes we feel like pounding our head against the wall, wondering how we could be so foolish as to do the sinful things we do. We hurt inside. And it is not just guilt for being caught or feeling the embarrassment for having to confess. It is godly sorrow we are feeling.<br><br>Years ago I saw a painting in an old<i>Instructor</i>magazine entitled<i>Turning Toward the Light</i>(by Ray W. Hellberg, center spread between pages 20 and 21 in "Four Faces of Repentance,"<i>Instructor,</i>January 1965). It made quite an impression on me. It portrays the stages a person goes through to be totally rid of his or her sins--from the agonizing pain of darkness to the glimmer of hope and recognition that there is a Light we can turn to and then to fully committing to dedicate ourselves to that Light.<br><br>Who is it in scripture that comes to your mind that has given us the most detailed, the most graphic portrayal of the pains of a damned soul? You probably think first of Alma the Younger, and we are glad that he was willing to divulge, and actually carve into the record, those intimate and agonizing details of what he went through to be forgiven of his sins (see Mosiah 27:28–29 and Alma 36:12–17).<br><br>He described wading through tribulation, the bitterness, the bonds, the abyss, and the inexpressible horror at the thought of having to stand before God and answer for all he had done. Alma wrote that he was "harrowed up" by the memory of his many sins. What is a harrow? Those involved in cultivating field crops know that it is an implement that is dragged behind an animal (and now behind a tractor) to break up the hard ground for planting. If a harrow were dragged over a live body, it would certainly become an instrument of torture. Alma also wrote that he was racked with torment. What is a rack? An instrument of torture. Alma chose his words intentionally; he was tortured by his sins, just as is the man portrayed in the painting.<br><br>Alma later taught his own wayward son, one who was sinning grievously while serving a mission, "Let your sins trouble you"--meaning what? Let your sins bother you to bring you down to severe depression? No. Alma said, "Let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance" (Alma 42:29). Be glad to suffer the godly sorrow now so you won't have to suffer the full effects of your sins later.<br><h2><b>Confession Is Necessary</b></h2><br>President Spencer W. Kimball taught:<br><br><i>No one can ever be forgiven of any transgression until there is repentance, and one has not repented until he has bared his soul and admitted his intentions and weaknesses without excuses or rationalizations. He must admit to himself that he has grievously sinned. When he has confessed to himself without the slightest minimizing of the offense, or rationalizing its seriousness, or soft-pedaling its gravity, and admits it is as<strong>big</strong>as it really<strong>is,</strong>then he is ready to begin his repentance.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_love-vs-lust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Love Versus Lust</a>," BYU devotional address, 5 January 1965; emphasis in original]<br><br>We have a worry these days. Many in this generation seem to be growing up with the carefree attitude "I can sin now, and I can always repent later. It only takes a few months of waiting and I can go on a mission or I can go to the temple." But Elder Richard G. Scott warned, "The thought of intentionally committing serious sin now and repenting later is perilously wrong. . . . Premeditated sin has greater penalties and is harder to overcome" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1994/10/making-the-right-choices?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making the Right Choices</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, 38–39).<br><br>We must confess and forsake our sins now and not put off our repentance. Alma warned us not to procrastinate the day of our repentance. As the old rabbis used to say: You cannot repent the day before you die, because you don't know what day you will die.<br><br>When we returned to Utah in 2000 after our mission in Chile, we found our oldest daughter dating a young man named McKell, a lively returned missionary who was also involved in theater programs at Brigham Young University. He was a frequent visitor in our home, and we came to like him.<br><br>That fall our daughter was awakened one Sunday morning to hear some terrible news. Her friend McKell had been visiting a cousin along the Oregon coast, and the two of them were far out on a pier when a storm came up suddenly and swept them off into the water. His cousin was battered among some rocks and was rushed off to a hospital, where he struggled for his life. McKell was apparently swept away by the undertow, and his body was not recovered. Eight days later, the very day of a memorial service for him, his body washed up onto the shore and could finally have a proper burial.<br><br>McKell was a good young man, just twenty-five years old. I don't believe he knew that he would be leaving the earth that day.<br><br>Sister Davidson was one of our extraordinary sister missionaries in Chile. When she finished her mission she returned to school at BYU and continued serving in her ward. One Sunday afternoon while crossing the street near her apartment, she was struck by a car and killed. She was on her way to a meeting and found herself on the way to a different meeting. I spoke in a memorial service for her a few days later. I don't believe Sister Davidson knew she would be leaving the earth that day.<br><br>The fact is, none of us knows exactly when we will be departing this mortal sphere, so we should be ready always--never procrastinating the day of our repentance but repenting daily and keeping ourselves prepared to meet God.<br><br>Don't wait until the pressure situations of mission and marriage arrive to do your repenting. If the announcements and invitations have already been sent out and you have the interview with the bishop and a member of the stake presidency, and then you realize together that you are not ready for the sacred covenant-making in the house of the Lord--then what do you do? It could be pretty embarrassing, couldn't it? The embarrassment doesn't matter; you don't ever want to enter the holy temple if you are not worthy. To take upon yourself the most sacred covenants and make the most binding promises of your whole life when you are not spiritually prepared or worthy to do so would bring upon you serious condemnation.<br><br>Before going to the temple, before going to sacrament meeting, even before kneeling to pray, be reconciled to Heavenly Father and to the Savior--and if there is any conflict or friction between you and any other person, get it resolved now.<br><h2><b>Forsaking Our Sins Is Necessary</b></h2><br>The scriptures teach that forsaking our sins is necessary. The Lord said, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). To forsake means to give up, abandon. Indeed, we must abandon all sin as soon as we can--and it might require a lengthy and mighty struggle to rid ourselves of our toughest and most perplexing weaknesses. It is essential, as soon as possible, to expel sin from our lives. That is forsaking.<br><br>There is another angle for us to look at regarding the forsaking of sins. When I was first called to work with the missionaries at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, I quickly learned that by far most of the elders and sisters were prepared and worthy to be there. Those who were not soon found that they couldn't learn the lessons and they couldn't learn to love their companion; nothing seemed to go right because they couldn't get the Spirit, and they couldn't get the Spirit because they were not clean. Those few had to return home and repent, and then many of them were able to return to the MTC and make it work.<br><br>Although the great majority of the missionaries were prepared and worthy to be there--learning to represent the Lord Jesus Christ--I noticed that even among them there were some who caught themselves agonizing over past sins. They had fully repented, but they still had a bright recollection of their recent (and sometimes distant) sins, and they became depressed as they remembered the gross sins of their past. What hadn't they done? They hadn't forsaken those sins in yet another sense. Part of forsaking is forgiving yourself and putting the sins behind you--burying the old man of sin, as the apostle Paul put it (see Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:11–12)--and leaving them buried and not digging them up anymore.<br><br>Sometimes people will sincerely desire to repent and secure Heavenly Father's complete forgiveness, saying to the Savior, "Here, Lord. Here is my whole package of sin. Please take it away."<br><br>And He does.<br><br>Then we go back and say, "Wait a minute. Give me some of those sins back; I want to ­suffer a little more for them!"<br><br>No. When you have totally repented, you must forsake those sins, forget about them, bury them away, and not bring them up again. Jesus beautifully stated the principle in agricultural terms: "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62). In other words, when you have planted your life in a more spiritual furrow, keep your eyes straight ahead and don't look back to the old sins, the old people, the old places. Someone has suggested that when Satan reminds you of your past, just remind him of his future! Keep your eyes looking ahead and on the Savior.<br><br>I really like some words from Isaiah 54:4: "Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth." I am taking those words out of their historical context, but I find the phrase itself profoundly meaningful. We all know that nobody gets through teenage years unscathed. Everyone has problems growing up--some worse than others--but it is imperative that we forget the shame of our youth. Repent, put it behind you, and move on. Even Joseph Smith confessed that during his youth he struggled, as he wrote, with<br><br><i>all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God.</i>[JS--H 1:28]<br><br>Joseph went on to explain that he was never guilty of any great or malignant sins; he was never disposed to commit such, but he did have to repent and put those indiscretions behind him. So did the apostle Paul. He, too, had to dispose of a sinful past. He wrote to the Saints in Macedonia: "<i>Forgetting those things which are behind, . . .</i>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God" (Philippians 3:13–14; emphasis added).<br><br>One sister missionary, while bearing her testimony during the first hours at the MTC, explained that she had experienced a long, hard struggle to prepare herself and be worthy to represent the Lord as a missionary. She didn't go into any detail of her past sins; she just let everyone know that she had gone through an extended period of serious repentance. At one point in her testimony she stopped and smiled and said, "I can't even remember the person I used to be."<br><br>When you have fully repented of your sins and are converted to the Lord, you are born again--you become a new person. You don't have to be concerned about your old sins because that old person who committed those sins is buried away. That is not you. You have become a new person who would not commit such sins. Therefore you can forgive yourself, forsake those sins, and forget your past. It's like Sister Ogden's organ playing: whenever she makes a mistake, she has to forget it and move on. She can't dwell on it. There is much more to get right.<br><br>Jesus helps you become a new and different person who has learned the divine principles of<i>forgiving</i>and<i>forgetting.</i>The Hebrew word for<i>atonement</i>is<i>kippur</i>(as in Yom Kippur: the day of atonement), and the basic meaning of<i>kippur</i>is to cover up. The Savior has suffered for, and covered up, the sins of us all--pending our complete repentance.<br><h2><b>The Good News of Repentance</b></h2><br>The scriptures not only teach that there are awful consequences of not repenting but also that there are extraordinary rewards for repenting. The gospel of Jesus Christ is occasionally referred to in the scriptures as "the gospel of repentance" (D&amp;amp;C 13:1; 138:57; JS--H 1:69). The word<i>gospel</i>means "good news"; therefore it is the good news of repentance. We sometimes look upon repentance as a punishment--as a distasteful, negative thing. It does involve some pain, of course, but genuine repentance is a blessing--a happy, positive thing.<br><br>Two questions are often asked:<br><br>1. How can I know if I have been forgiven of my sins? King Benjamin's answer is that you will have "peace of conscience" (Mosiah 4:3). By that peace and the Spirit you will know.<br><br>2. If the Lord says He will forgive and forget, why can't I forget? If I sit down and think about it, why can I still conjure up the lurid details of my past sins? The Lord leaves the memory in your mind as an early warning system; it is protection against going back to the old ways, the old sins. Alma didn't say he could remember his sins no more; he said he could remember his pain no more. He could remember his sins all right, but he was not harrowed up by the memory of those sins because he had repented of them.<br><br>When you fully repent you are born again and become a new person (see Mosiah 27:24–29), and the cloud of darkness that once overshadowed you is removed (see Helaman 5:11, 41).<br><br>Whatever your past has been, your future is spotless, so tie yourself to your potential, not to your past. One of the most beautiful truths of the plan of happiness is that the Lord ­forgives and forgets (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42). He chooses what He will remember. When you forsake "Babylon," God forgets that you ever lived there.<br><br>Unless you have murdered someone (premeditated murder) or committed the sin against the Holy Ghost (as very few have), you can be totally forgiven of all your sins. That is indeed good news. But you must ask! The Lord said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee,<i>according to thy petition</i>" (D&amp;amp;C 90:1; emphasis added).<br><br>One day while working at my desk in BYU's Joseph Smith Building, I had to erase some writing at the top of some student assignments. I reached into a drawer where I keep a box of pencils that each have an eraser at the end. I grabbed one of the erasers and began vigorously erasing, and while I was erasing I admit that the smell brought back some nostalgic feelings. All through the years of growing up, just before elementary school began each year, I remember going out with my mother and buying school supplies: paper, notebooks, pencils, rulers--and erasers. Is that negative thinking or what? We bought erasers. They were a real part of learning. We knew we would make mistakes and needed erasers. So it is in life. We knew we would come to earth to this "education probation" and make mistakes. We need erasers, and, fortunately, our mistakes are not written in ink--just pencil--and can be totally erased.<br><h2><b>A Complete Cleansing Is Needed</b></h2><br>Sister Ogden and I sometimes find ourselves sitting alone at our kitchen table eating a meal, but that's all right since we are both voracious readers. We always have a stack of reading material (newspapers,<i>Ensign, Reader's Digest, National Geographic,</i>or one of her "health nut" publications). One day I was thumbing through a magazine when a certain page caught my attention. Half the page showed a man with a serious look on his face, and superimposed on the picture was a question in big print: ARE YOU CLEANSED? That question aroused my curiosity. I noticed that the page was advertising a whole line of cleanses: adrenal cleanse, blood cleanse, heart cleanse, joint cleanse, kidney cleanse, liver cleanse, and prostate cleanse. Then I noticed something that caught my attention even more. Just below the picture of the man was the sentence "At last, a complete cleanse line from a name I can trust." Now you might suspect how that sentence registered in my mind: Yes, I thought, I certainly do know about a complete cleanse that comes through a Name I can trust.<br><br>In Santiago, Chile, there are at least four ambulance companies in that city of more than six million people. One of the companies is called Rescate Total ("Total Rescue"), and every time I saw one of the ambulances driving by, I thought, "No, I know where total rescue comes from. His name is Jesus Christ." And His is the only name under heaven whereby salvation comes, from whom a complete cleanse can come--again, because He is the One who paid the price. He can take away all our transgressions.<br><h2><b>The Baptism of Repentance</b></h2><br>Sometimes we look with envy on the new convert stepping out of the baptismal font; we feel almost jealous of the fact that there goes the cleanest, purest person on earth. We think, "Oh that I could be baptized again and be freed from all my sins." The fact is that we can be freed from all our sins regularly. If we go to sacrament meeting each week, and we go there having thoroughly repented of all our sins and then worthily eat that little piece of bread and drink that little cup of water, we may leave that meeting totally void of sin. We can literally be clean and pure as we walk out of sacrament meeting each week. We experience again and again the baptism of repentance.<br><h2><b>True Repentance Requires More Than a Cleansing</b></h2><br>Actually, the whole process of repentance requires more than just a cleansing, and we need to do more than just repair all damage done. Early in 1984, while returning to our home in Jerusalem, I must have been handling our large, heavy suitcases in such a way that something went wrong in my lower back. For several months I found myself in periodic excruciating pain--apparently from some bone fragments sticking in the largest nerve in my body, the sciatic nerve that runs down the spine and into the legs. After three months of experimental treatments in Israeli doctors' offices and hospitals, and not being able to function because of the intense pain, my doctor put me on the strongest painkiller he could prescribe without personally accompanying me and sent me on a plane flight across the world to Salt Lake City for a back operation. The surgery was successful. After some weeks of recovery I flew back to the Holy Land to resume what I loved: teaching and guiding the students on field trips throughout the lands of the Bible and, over the years, climbing Mount Sinai a total of eighteen times.<br><br>I learned something from that painful ordeal. It is not enough to repair the damage done. I have to continually strengthen my back so it doesn't happen again. So it is with repentance: we must cleanse ourselves of all that is wrong inside, repair the damage that has been done, and continually strengthen ourselves to become more and more resistant to sin and more and more capable of sustaining light and truth from Him who is our strength. It is through daily diligence to prayer and scriptures, along with exact obedience to all other commandments, and serving others and worshiping in the temple that we keep ourselves strong and avoid the sinning.<br><br>Each of us will stand before our Father and look into His divine eyes and report on what we have done with this brief moment of time. We will all have photographic memories (and instant recall!), a perfect recollection of all we've done on earth--and that perfect awareness will either send us into deep despair and remorse or fill us with happiness and gratitude. It is up to us. We will all live forever--no exceptions. And we are determining each day exactly where and with whom we will live forever. Whatever has gone wrong in our lives that has tainted or darkened our souls can be erased, cleansed, removed, and purified by the power of sincere repentance. It is a miracle. Any evil words and deeds continue to reverberate through the universe until we pay the price of godly sorrow and total repentance; then they are completely obliterated. They are not there anymore, and we become a new person, full of light.<br><br>It makes me happy to talk about the twin miracles of repentance and forgiveness. It makes me happy to talk about the Savior and applying His atoning blood through the miracle of repentance. That way we acquire more and more light--until the day when we can become perfectly holy, as He is.<br><br>I testify of, and I rejoice in, these beautiful truths--in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>How the Light Gets In” - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
An important problem that arises in many settings is the Traveling Salesman Problem.<br><br>A traveler must visit many destinations to sell her goods or make her deliveries. Her problem is this: what route will be the fastest way to get to all the destinations? A poor choice could mean she travels many times farther than she would if she made a good choice.<br><br>Obviously this problem is important to companies like UPS, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart, and Amazon. For example, according to<i>Wired</i>magazine, UPS has roughly 55,000 delivery trucks running each day. If each driver could choose a route that shaves just one mile off the daily trip, that would save the company $30 million each year.<sup>1</sup><br><br>And this problem is not only interesting to companies involved in delivery. The Traveling Salesman Problem also has applications in computer chip manufacturing, DNA sequencing, and many other areas.<br><br>Consider the situation for three destinations--call them A, B, and C. One of the possible routes our traveler could take to these three destinations would be to first go to city C, then to city B, then to city A, and then home again.<br><br>Altogether there are six possible routes in this situation, so to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with three destinations, I need only compare the six routes and see which is shortest.<br><br>With four destinations I must check a bit more: twenty-four possible routes. I can do that. With five destinations we have 120 routes. I am too lazy to check all those, but it is not hard to write some computer code to do it for me. You may have noticed that the number of routes to check is growing rapidly. For ten destinations we have 3,628,800 possible routes to check--a lot, but not impossible.<br><br>For twenty destinations it grows to 2,432,902,008,176,640,000. This is a little too big for my laptop to check in any reasonable amount of time. In fact, if my computer could check a billion routes per second, it would still take seventy-seven years to check all the possible routes. At current energy prices, just the electricity for the computation would cost roughly $675,000.<br><br>Now let me reassure you. It may look like I am going all mathy on you, but don't worry--I won't make you compute anything, you don't need to remember any of these numbers, and there won't be a quiz at the end. So stay with me for just a bit longer.<br><br>The point is, even for just twenty destinations we have way too many possible routes to check in any reasonable amount of time. The bad news is that in many real-life situations we have a lot more destinations than just twenty--for example, a UPS driver makes an average of 120 deliveries each day.<br><br>For 120 deliveries there are so many possible routes we couldn't store them all in the memory of any computer in existence, not even if our computer's memory comprised all the atoms in the universe--or even all the atoms in a googol<sup>2</sup>universes as big as ours (that's a one with a hundred zeros after it).<br><br>If we could find a way to deal with the memory problem, we'd still have to check all the routes. If we had as many processors as particles in the universe and if each processor could check a trillion routes per second, it would still take more than a googol years--far, far more than the age of the universe.<br><br>The Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has even offered a one-million-dollar prize for the first person to find an algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>Many other important mathematical problems suffer from similar difficulties--we can't seem to solve them exactly because they are just way, way too big.<br><br>These sorts of problems show up in many aspects of our lives: curing diseases, preventing accidents, reducing pollution and traffic jams, and building smarter robots. They are also important for better understanding how the world works: modeling important biological and chemical processes; modeling populations of people, animals, and bacteria; understanding how galaxies form; and many other aspects of our world.<br><br>With all these problems, as long as we insist on getting a perfect answer--the one and only very best route--we are utterly paralyzed by the size and complexity of the problem. You could say we are <i>paralyzed by perfection.</i><br><br>But despite their complexity and size, we still need to solve these problems. So let me tell you how to become unparalyzed. And because this is a devotional talk, you know that I will also use this as a metaphor for something spiritual.<br><h2><b>Step 1. Admit and Accept Imperfection</b></h2><br>The first step is to admit and accept imperfection.<br><br>For many of these hard problems, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, if we really want a good answer in a reasonable amount of time, we must make a compromise; we must make do with an approximation and admit some chance of error. I am something of a perfectionist, so this is difficult for me.<br><br>But if I am willing to accept an answer that is only close to the perfect one--a good answer but not the perfect answer, an answer with some error in it--as soon as I give up on perfection, something amazing happens. We can get a very good approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem very quickly. In fact, not just very quickly, but blazingly, astoundingly fast.<br><br>Now this solution is not a perfect solution. It will not win the Clay Math million-dollar prize because it is not exact. But it is a very good solution. And if you need a better one, we can do that too. Not perfect, but better.<br><br>Similarly, in our own lives, to avoid being paralyzed by perfection we must admit and accept imperfection. This requires honesty and humility. We can't try to cover up our ignorance or our mistakes. We must admit them and learn from them.<br><br>In fact, I know only a few things perfectly: among those, that the Father and the Son live and love me and you, that the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be, and that this church is where the Lord wants me to be.<br><br>I also know, with a perfect knowledge, that for now, on this earth, we are all imperfect, both in knowledge and in performance, but Christ's Atonement can bring us to perfection if we allow it to.<br><br>The first step to applying the Atonement is to admit and accept our imperfection.<br><br>We are all imperfect, but it is not always easy to admit that. Being a mathematician often forces me to admit what I don't know. Julia Robinson, the first woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences and past president of the American Mathematical Society, was once required to submit a description of what she did each day to her university's personnel office. This is what she wrote:<br><br><i>Monday--tried to prove theorem<br>Tuesday--tried to prove theorem<br>Wednesday--tried to prove theorem<br>Thursday--tried to prove theorem<br>Friday--theorem false</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Now, while a star like Julia Robinson may find her mistakes after only a week, people like me usually need a lot more time than that to figure out our mistakes--and even more time to get the courage to admit them.<br><br>And it is not only our knowledge that is imperfect. Just as the computer has limited ability to execute the programs given it, so we have limited ability to execute what we know we should. To survive and succeed in this life we must admit and accept that imperfection and be patient and understanding with imperfection in ourselves and in others.<br><br>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland told us at general conference this April:<br><br><i>Be kind regarding human frailty--your own as well as that of those who serve with you in a Church led by volunteer, mortal men and women. Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>And it is not only human weaknesses we must accept. Sometimes perfection just isn't possible in our finite, imperfect world. When my wife was a missionary in Germany, she and her companion decided they were going to keep all of the mission rules--exactly. They got out their white handbooks and the additional list of rules for their mission and sat down with their blue planners to schedule everything into the week: wake up at 6:30 and then spend one-half hour for personal scripture study, one-half hour for companion scripture study, one-half hour for exercise, and so on throughout the day. But somehow they couldn't make it all fit before their required bedtime of 10:30. They tried and tried, but they just couldn't get it to work. They only figured out why it was so hard to schedule when they added up all the hours necessary to keep every rule each day--twenty-five.<br><br>The realities of living in our limited, imperfect world mean that we have no choice but to make do with an approximation--to admit and accept imperfection.<br><h2><b>Step 2. Work Hard to Get Your Best Approximation</b></h2><br>The second step is to work hard to get your best approximate solution to your problem.<br><br>As I mentioned before, accepting imperfection transforms many important mathematical and computational problems from being unsolvable in the lifetime of the universe to being solvable now on current, actual computers--but the solutions still require deep thought and hard work.<br><br>In the same way, admitting and accepting imperfection allows us to find imperfect but workable solutions to our personal and spiritual problems--but these solutions also require deep thought and hard work.<br><br>As the Lord told Oliver Cowdery after he had tried unsuccessfully to translate the plates: "You took no thought save it was to ask me. . . . You must study it out in your mind."<sup>5</sup><br><br>And Brigham Young said: "Whatever duty you are called to perform, take your minds with you, and apply them to what is to be done."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Not long ago I had a student who told me he hated math and that he was no good at it. He was sure he would not understand the math in my class, and he was a little angry because he needed my class for some requirement or other. But with a lot of encouragement he reluctantly promised me he would do something he had not done before. He would not only answer all the homework exercises but would also really make sure he understood all the steps in each problem, why that step was the right thing to do, and why it worked. He agreed to study it out in his mind.<br><br>At first this was painful to him because he had never done math this way before. He really had to fight his frustration and impatience. He wanted to say, "Just tell me what to do and let me get this over with." But he kept his promise. He read and reread the explanations in the book. He came to my office hours and asked me lots of questions--questions about how and why things worked. He asked the TA many similar questions. And as he continued to work at it, he began to understand, for the first time, a little bit about how math works and why it is the way it is. Partway through the semester he confessed to me that he actually liked the class. By the end of the semester he not only earned a good grade in the class but was really excited about what he had learned. He even wanted to take another math class. He was no longer "bad at math." His hard work and deep thought had transformed not only his attitude but also his ability.<br><br>But this is not easy. My former neighbor Eliot Butler said it well:<br><br><i>To learn is hard work. It requires discipline. And there is much drudgery. When I hear someone say that learning is<b>fun,</b>I wonder if that person has never learned or if he has just never had fun. There are moments of excitement in learning: these seem usually to come after long periods of hard work, but not after all long periods of hard work.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>But, like it or not, it must be done--hard work and deep thought are the only way. As the Lord said to Oliver, "You<i>must</i>study it out."<sup>8</sup><br><h2><b>Step 3. Get Up and Act on Your Best Approximation</b></h2><br>It is not enough just to find our approximate answer to the problems. We must also act on that approximate, imperfect answer. This is hard because we know our answer is not perfect. That might scare you. It often scares me. But we cannot let our fear of imperfection, our fear of making a mistake, prevent us from acting on our best approximation.<br><br>As Paul told Timothy, "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."<sup>9</sup><br><br>When I went to graduate school many years ago, I was lucky enough to be admitted to a school with some famous faculty members. I had done pretty well in my undergraduate classes, and I thought I was pretty smart; so when it came time to choose classes and teachers, I chose some of the most famous teachers I could.<br><br>One of them was especially impressive. He was a Fields medalist--the nearest thing in mathematics to a Nobel Prize winner. Other students spoke of him with awe, both because of his brilliance and because of his reputation for criticizing students. When I heard how he had berated a student for being both lazy and stupid, I determined that I would never give him cause to criticize me like that. I decided never to ask him for advice or help until I had exhausted every other means for solving a problem. The result was that he never criticized me, but I also never learned much from him. I spent three years in his classes and only spoke with him for a total of about forty-five minutes.<br><br>Another of his students had no fear at all--he would go to this professor almost every day to ask questions. And he was criticized regularly, but he never seemed to care. I thought he was completely crazy, but he went back almost every day, got his questions answered, and learned a lot.<br><br>It took me several years after graduation to realize that I had wasted the opportunity of a lifetime--this other student wasn't so crazy after all. He got many hours of personal tutoring from one of the world's greatest mathematical minds, and I got--well, I got through graduate school safely, without being criticized.<br><h3><strong><i>Don't Bury Your Talent</i></strong></h3><br>The Lord is pretty clear that He wants something more from us than this. He has given us many talents and opportunities. He wants us to face our fears and do something good with all He has given us.<br><br>Consider His parable about the rich nobleman who entrusted his wealth with his servants while he went traveling abroad.<br><br>You know the story, so I'll skip to the end. "He which had received the one talent came and said, Lord . . . I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. . . . His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant. . . . Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. . . . And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Now think a moment about that servant with one talent. This is a very severe punishment. After all, he took good care of that money. Not one cent was lost. Yet the master not only chastised him and took his talent, he cast him into outer darkness.<br><br>The Lord doesn't care about<i>not messing up--</i>not losing what we have. It isn't enough to<i>preserve</i>what He has given us. He wants us to get up and do something with it.<br><h3><strong><i>Fear Causes Failure</i></strong></h3><br>Like the one-talent servant, when we are afraid of failure we are more likely to fail.<br><br>When I was a teenager I worked for two summers as a lifeguard and a swim instructor. One of the things I learned in that job was that people's fear of water is usually their greatest obstacle to successful swimming.<br><br>A person learning to float on his back, for example, when he is afraid, will instinctively try to sit up, which causes him to sink. To float he must relax and put his head back and his legs down. Then he can float on his back with very little effort.<br><br>The real key is learning to trust that a little water splashing in your face does not mean you are drowning. It may not be what we imagine to be perfect floating, but it is good enough. Even going completely below the water is not failure--if you remain relaxed, a gentle hand motion quickly brings you back up to the top. But as soon as you become nervous, you try to sit up, and you will sink.<br><br>Similarly, when my kids first started ice-skating lessons, they were unable to stand on their skates without help and clung to the little walkers that were available at the arena for nonskaters. Even with the little walkers they fell often. They were surprised when the first thing the instructor did was to take away the walkers and teach them to fall. They practiced falling over and over. One of my daughters complained that falling was the one thing she could do without lessons or help.<br><br>But once they had finished their falling lesson they could skate--almost as if by magic.And they didn't even fall much after that. By overcoming their fear of falling, by embracing the fall, they were able to learn to avoid it and were able to try new things without fear.<br><h3><strong><i>The Plan of Salvation</i></strong></h3><br>The most important example of all is the plan of salvation. The entire plan depends upon our engaging in a very dangerous enterprise.<br><br>Recall that Satan's plan was to guarantee that bad things would not happen, that we would all be safe, and that we would all return to our Father after our time on earth. This plan was rejected not only because Satan wanted all the glory for himself but also, more importantly, because<i>it would not work.</i>It just wouldn't work.<br><br>We cannot become like our Father in Heaven unless we learn for ourselves to refuse the evil and choose the good. We must act for ourselves and choose for ourselves. But, as Lehi tells us, we cannot do this unless we are enticed by two opposites--unless we have the option to fail.<sup>11</sup><br><br>Not only must we have the<i>option</i>to fail--we<i>will</i>fail. We<i>do</i>fail. Often.<br><br>The most miraculous proof of God's love for us is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The purpose of the Atonement is precisely to allow us to recover from our many failures. He knows we will fail, despite our best efforts, and He has provided a way for us to be freed from our sins, to be healed, and to return to Him.<br><br>We show our gratitude for the Atonement when we use it to overcome our fear of failure, trust in Him, and act on our best approximation.<br><h3><strong><i>Aim High</i></strong></h3><br>Recently our academic vice president, Brent W. Webb, reminded us of something Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught us way back when he was president of BYU. He said that we hit what we aim at: "So, not failure but low aim would be the most severe indictment of a Latter-day Saint fortunate enough to be at BYU."<sup>12</sup><br><br>I should have listened more carefully to President Holland before I went off to graduate school. I hit what I aimed at--I graduated successfully without criticism from my teachers. Technically I did not fail. But, boy, did I aim low.<br><br>Fear of embarrassment, fear of failure, fear of being considered dumb by someone I thought was smart--fear made me aim low. Don't make that mistake. Aim high.<br><br>Please don't misunderstand me. When I say "aim high," I do not mean aim to be successful in your career. I do not mean aim to become rich or famous or powerful.<br><br>Those might be things that happen along the way for a few of us. But if they are your target, you are aiming way too low. Section 121 in the Doctrine and Covenants tells us that if we aim at these things--if our hearts are set upon the things of this world and if we aspire to the honors of men--we may be called, but we will not be chosen.<sup>13</sup><br><br>No--when I say "aim high," I mean we must aim to develop our talents and use our opportunities the best we can to build His kingdom, bless His children, spread His gospel, care for the needy, heal the sick, discover truth, teach that truth, and bring ourselves and our families back to live with Him.<br><br>We<i>will</i>make errors along the way. Aim high anyway. "Not failure but low aim would be the most severe indictment."<br><h2><b>Step 4. Do It Again</b></h2><br>Finally, an essential step after we try and fail is to repeat the cycle and improve on each attempt.<br><br>Some of the most powerful methods for solving hard mathematical problems are what we call<i>iterative methods.</i>You start with an approximate answer--sometimes just a random guess--but you use that guess to generate a new, slightly better answer. Then you take that new answer and apply the method again and again until you get as close as you need to the correct answer. There certainly are situations where these iterative methods don't work, but in many settings they are both the fastest and most robust ways to solve problems.<br><br>Iteration is a powerful tool in our lives as well. We repeat these three steps over and over again.<br><br>Let me tell you about my son Spencer, who likes to run. His first official race, when he was eight years old, was a 3K in Kiwanis Park. He did not do nearly as well as he had hoped to do. He really had to push hard to stay with the leaders, and, by the end, he just didn't have the strength to keep up. He was a little disappointed. The next two days he was really sore. He was forced to admit he wasn't yet as fit or as good at running as he wanted to be. But during that week he pushed himself harder in our daily run than he had in the past--he worked hard to prepare for his next attempt.<br><br>At the next race, one week later, he was a little worried he wouldn't do well. But he got up and ran the race despite his fears. This time he still had to push hard to keep up, and he still didn't stay with the leaders for the whole race, but he was able to stay with them for longer and his time improved a lot. Some of that improvement was from working harder in our daily workout, and some of it was from really running hard in the previous race. He was still a little disappointed that he didn't do as well as he wanted to.<br><br>But he repeated the process. Again he was sore after the race. Admitting that he didn't know as much about how to prepare for a race as he wanted to, he asked his uncle--an experienced distance runner--for advice on how to train better. Again he worked hard all week. Again he felt nervous before his next race, but again he put his fear aside, ran hard, and did better than the week before.<br><br>All through that first season he repeated this process. He had a race almost every week, and with each race he improved his time--a lot. Each race also motivated him to try harder in his daily runs and to learn more about running. And not only the preparation but also the races themselves helped make him stronger for his subsequent races. By the end of the season he had cut almost three minutes off his 3K time and had become one of the race leaders that others tried to keep up with.<br><br>Spencer was successful that running season because he followed the iterative method for pursuing perfection. Each week he admitted and accepted imperfection, he worked hard to improve, he braved his fears and made another attempt, and then he repeated the process over and over again.<br><br>This same process, this iterative method, will bring each of us closer and closer to perfection. We will not actually reach that goal in this life, but we will be better than before. We will get better and better.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Let me conclude with the chorus of Leonard Cohen's song "Anthem." Cohen may not have originally meant this verse exactly the way I interpret it, but for me it captures very well the idea I am trying to express today:<br><br><i>Ring the bells that still can ring<br>Forget your perfect offering<br>There is a crack in everything<br>That's how the light gets in.</i><br><br>Our bells are cracked. But let us ring those bells that still can ring. Stop worrying about your failure to achieve perfection--perfection is not possible in this life. Instead, embrace the light and healing power of Christ that come in through our cracks and imperfections.<br><br><i>Ring the bells that still can ring<br>Forget your perfect offering<br>There is a crack in everything<br>That's how the light gets in.</i><br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Tyler J.

<h1>t Through the Dark Glass - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In considering what I might say today, my mind kept turning to what the Apostle Paul said in his first epistle to the Corinthians: "For now we see through a glass, darkly."<sup>1</sup>Over many years I have thought a great deal about this statement and its meaning. The word seeing is often used to describe the action of visually or mentally perceiving or discerning. It can also mean to perceive or discern spiritually, and how we see is critical in shaping who we are, the choices we make, and who we become.<br><br>Research on seeing and perception is conducted in a number of different fields. In the visual arts we spend a considerable amount of time looking at things: we frequently discuss the process of seeing and carefully work to develop our abilities to see in an artistic context. It is clear that although we may see much in common, as humans we often see in vastly different ways. To illustrate this I invite you to carefully look at four works of art. As you do, consciously consider your response.<br><h2><b>Seeing Differently--Four Still-Life Paintings</b></h2><br>The first work was executed in blue-black ink on paper and is entitled<i>Six Persimmons.</i>It was painted by the Chinese monk Mu Qi (Chi) in the thirteenth century. Mu Qi was a Zen monk who lived during the Song dynasty and worked toward a highly reduced form of brush painting. It is said that Zen Buddhism--a school of thought that highly valued meditation as an avenue for enlightenment--was the most stripped-down form of Buddhism and greatly influenced the artist's views. This painting became famous for its skilled and minimal brushstrokes and its painterly simplicity and was considered an unprecedented artistic innovation.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The second work is a seventeenth-century Italian baroque watercolor painting on parchment entitled<i>A Bowl with Peaches and Plums.</i>In the baroque period, naturalistic and highly detailed painting flourished, and still-life painting was often symbolic, teaching moral lessons. This work is by the artist Giovanna Garzoni. The fact that Garzoni was a very successful female artist made her quite unusual for her time. She was also one of the first women to focus on still-life painting.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The third work is by the French artist Paul Cézanne. It is an oil painting entitled<i>Ginger Pot with Pomegranate and Pears</i>and was completed sometime around 1890. Cézanne was considered a Postimpressionist and was one of the most important painters of the second half of the nineteenth century. His brushwork, planes of color, and explorations of geometric simplicity laid the foundation for the transition from nineteenth-century artistic ideas to a new and very different twentieth-century art world.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The fourth and final work is an oil painting entitled<i>Still Life Portuguese.</i>It was painted in 1917 by Robert Delaunay, a French artist who with his artist wife, Sonia, and others cofounded the Cubist-influenced art movement called Orphism, which emphasized the optical characteristics of bright and bold colors. Delaunay played a key role in establishing abstraction as a stylistic expression and was one of the earliest nonrepresentational painters.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Though all of these pieces of art are similar in that they are paintings of still-life subjects, they are also significantly different in terms of how the subjects are seen, interpreted, and presented. There were numerous factors that influenced the decisions of each of these ­artists--factors that both enabled and limited their ability to see. As you look at these paintings, how do you see them? Do you make connections between the paintings? Perhaps you respond with greater interest to some rather than to others. Are you indifferent? What are the reasons you respond the way you do? Does the minimal information I have provided affect how you see the individual works? I hope you enjoy them.<br><br>Just like these artists, our vision is influenced by many factors that ultimately impact how we think, feel, and act. Each of us has strengths, limitations, and personal lenses that filter and color how we see and perceive. In many ways it is important that we as ­individuals see things differently. This allows for insight and innovation, enables us to learn and benefit from each other, and also tends to make things more interesting. This is certainly something I have learned in my marriage. Just ask my wife, Jennifer.<br><h2><b>Seeing Through a Glass Darkly</b></h2><br>We live in an incredible time with so much available to us and so many possibilities. At moments, however, it can be extremely challenging to see our way clearly with the abundance of information, perspectives, attitudes, feelings, criticisms, forces, and beliefs that surround us. It can seem as if we are seeing through a glass darkly.<br><br>Years ago when I was an undergraduate art student here at BYU, I was offered a job working as a metal chaser in a local bronze foundry that cast and finished sculptures for artists. Given that I had virtually no experience with the bronze-casting process, I was somewhat surprised I was offered the job and also a little apprehensive about what it would require. But after being assured that I would receive training in the techniques required for my particular responsibilities--and anticipating that this knowledge might be useful in my future as an artist--I accepted the job.<br><br>Initially one of the most daunting duties for me was welding. As a result of the bronze-casting process, there were frequently several different parts of a sculpture that needed to be welded back together. Given the fact that there is a long list of real dangers associated with welding and I had no idea of what I was doing, this part of my job made me a little nervous. Ignorance and danger can be a bad combination!<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, I was promised I would receive training, and I did. My supervisor gave me instructions on the use of the welder, on safety, and on welding technique. He even demonstrated the process for me. But being told or even shown how to do something isn't the same as doing it, let alone doing it well.<br><br>For my initiation into welding I was encouraged to practice with some bronze scraps under the guidance of my supervisor. As instructed, I properly prepared the work area and tools and carefully adorned myself with all of the necessary safety gear, which included thick leather gloves, a special leather jacket, and a protective welding helmet with a glass lens. As I readied myself to begin, I pulled the helmet down over my face--and it was completely dark. I couldn't see anything through the glass lens.<br><br>The lens on a welding helmet is very darkly tinted in order to protect the eyes of the person welding from the extremely bright light produced by the welder. How could I weld if I couldn't see? I lifted the helmet, turned to my supervisor, and shared my dilemma. He patiently explained that in order to see through the lens, I must rely on the light produced by the welder. I must learn to use the light. What a revelation!<br><br>I again checked to make sure everything was prepared, lowered the helmet, and, as perspiration trickled down my face, started the welder. With a flash I could see. My vision wasn't clear, but I was able to see well enough to learn.<br><br>I actually failed miserably on that first welding attempt. I melted a big hole in the piece of bronze, and it wasn't the last time I made a mistake. However, with effort, practice, and the tolerance of my supervisor, I was able to improve my skills as a welder, and, in the process, I came to better understand the light and to use it more effectively to see through the dark glass lens. In a sense, the lens became clearer.<br><br>As we are confronted with difficult choices and decisions, especially those related to our eternal progress, we must prepare ourselves, act in faith, and learn to use and rely on the light. As we do so, the personal lens through which each of us sees can become clearer, and we will be better able to make decisions that will bless our lives and lead us to Christ.<br><h2><b>Sources of Light</b></h2><br>There are two important sources of light that I would like to discuss: the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Each of us has been blessed with the Light of Christ. The scriptures teach that the Light of Christ is "the Spirit [which] giveth light to every man [and woman] that cometh into the world."<sup>6</sup>It is the "light [which] proceedeth forth from the presence of God [through Jesus Christ] to fill the immensity of space"<sup>7</sup>and "the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed."<sup>8</sup>It is "the light which shineth [and] enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings."<sup>9</sup><br><br>The Light of Christ is sometimes called "the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"<sup>10</sup>"the Spirit of the Lord,"<sup>11</sup>or "the Spirit of God."<sup>12</sup>It is also referred to as our conscience and "is given to every man [and woman], that [they] may know good from evil."<sup>13</sup>It is "the light by which [we] may judge,"<sup>14</sup>and it can be a powerful source of inspiration.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer taught:<br><br><i>The Spirit of Christ can enlighten the inventor, the scientist, the painter, the sculptor, the composer, the performer, the architect, the author to produce great, even inspired things for the blessing and good of all mankind.</i><br><br><i>This Spirit can prompt the farmer in his field and the fisherman on his boat. It can inspire the teacher in the classroom, the missionary in presenting his discussion. It can inspire the student who listens. And of enormous importance, it can inspire husband and wife, and father and mother.</i><br><br><i>This inner Light can warn and guard and guide.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>The Light of Christ also helps to prepare people for the message of the gospel, and it leads them to repent, be baptized, and receive an even greater source of light: the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ are two distinct influences, but, in addition to the constancy of the Light of Christ, the Holy Ghost may, from time to time, manifest Himself to any man or woman--regardless of their circumstances--who is honestly seeking truth about the Lord and His gospel. In this sense the Holy Ghost works in concert with the Light of Christ.<br><br>Though we might make choices that lead us down very dark paths, the Light of Christ continues to abide with us. President Harold B. Lee explained that the Light of Christ<br><br><i>never entirely goes out unless we commit the ­unpardonable sin. Its glow may be so dim that we can hardly perceive it, but it is there for us to fan into a flame that shall burn brighter with understanding and with knowledge.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>With his permission I would like to share a story a good friend recently told me. This friend was raised in the Church, and, while young, he was baptized, given the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood. During his teenage years he made some friends who had values dramatically different from those he had been taught in his home and at church. Over a number of years he made some poor decisions and became involved in behaviors that were deceptive, destructive, and not aligned with the teachings of the gospel. As a result he didn't enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and turned from much of the light available to him.<br><br>As he approached mission age he continued to be involved in these poor behaviors but also began to have questions about the direction of his life. One day while under the influence of an illegal substance, he had an experience--a very powerful spiritual ­experience--that he recognized as coming through the Holy Ghost. Although it came under surprising circumstances, that ­experience ­provided clarity for him and ultimately changed the course of his life. He repented, served a mission, and was married in the temple. He has a wonderful family and a powerful testimony and is an active and contributing member of the Church.<br><br>Some may dismiss or make light of my friend's experience upon hearing it, but I was perplexed. How could the Holy Ghost speak to someone who was not only disobeying commandments but was also at that moment under the influence of a mind-altering substance? Perhaps we can understand how this is possible when we comprehend "that the Holy Ghost can work [with and] through the Light of Christ"<sup>17</sup>to manifest truth and light.<br><br>As many of you are aware, the Holy Ghost "is a personage of Spirit"<sup>18</sup>and the third member of the Godhead. As such, He plays a unique role and can be a great blessing in our lives. He is a messenger and a witness of our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ,<sup>19</sup>and He testifies of the truths of the gospel. He is the source of spiritual gifts.<sup>20</sup>He can reveal the will of the Lord in our lives, He acts as a "cleansing agent to purify . . . and sanctify [us] from . . . sin,"<sup>21</sup>and, as the Comforter, He brings "peace to our souls."<sup>22</sup>Through His power our minds can be enlightened,<sup>23</sup>we can be blessed with new ideas,<sup>24</sup>and we "may know the truth of all things."<sup>25</sup><br><br>The fulness of the blessings given through the Holy Ghost are only available to those who receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is bestowed by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood after a person is baptized into the Church. After receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have the right to His constant companionship and the blessings associated with it if we keep the commandments and remain worthy.<sup>26</sup><br><br>We frequently call the spiritual manifestations of the Holy Ghost inspiration or personal revelation, and these communications may come to us in a variety of ways, including impressions, promptings, thoughts, and feelings. Most often the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost whispers to our hearts and minds<sup>27</sup>and brings feelings of peace, assurance, and confirmation.<br><br>The Holy Ghost can direct us in all of the important aspects of our lives if we are prepared. Learning to recognize and rely on the Spirit, however, requires faith, humility, and continued practice. Rather than receiving clarity on all matters simultaneously, we typically receive guidance on specific questions.<br><h2><b>Seeking Direction and Receiving Guidance</b></h2><br>Though many things are unclear to me, I recognize that I have been blessed on countless occasions through the power and influence of the Holy Ghost. I also understand the importance of continually seeking to better understand and use the remarkable gift of light that comes from Him. Let me share another experience.<br><br>Many times throughout my life I have felt prompted that I should pursue my interests in art and develop my abilities. As a result of these promptings and as a result of careful and prayerful consideration, Jennifer and I agreed that I should pursue graduate studies in art after completing my degree at BYU. When the time came I researched numerous programs across the country, pondered options, fasted, prayed, and selected several programs to which I submitted applications. Given all of the factors, this was not an easy task, but we were excited about the possibilities.<br><br>After waiting several months I started to receive letters from the various programs I had applied to. Good news: I had options! But Jennifer and I then faced the dilemma of making a decision. We carefully reviewed the pros and cons of the individual programs and we prayed, earnestly seeking divine guidance.<br><br>On one occasion during this period of time I walked into an office here on campus and noticed on a desk a letter with the logo for The Ohio State University. Immediately a distinct thought popped into my head: "You should apply there." I hadn't previously considered Ohio State. I thought about it for a second, but it was quite late in the year to apply to programs, and given that I already had offers from other schools, I dismissed the thought.<br><br>Within a few days of that experience I was walking down a hall here in the Harris Fine Arts Center and saw a poster. You guessed it--the poster featured an Ohio State logo. Again the thought immediately popped into my head: "You should apply there." I started to get the idea, so I immediately found a computer, did a little bit of research, and, with some disappointment, discovered that the graduate application deadline for Ohio State had passed.<br><br>The following day I ran into one of my BYU professors who was--and still is--an influential mentor. He told me that he had been looking for me and explained that he had just gotten off the phone with a colleague from The Ohio State University. The colleague had called seeking recommendations for potential graduate students for his program. My mentor then explained that he had recommended me, and if interested, I should give the professor a call.<br><br>Long story short, it turns out that I made the call and things worked out very well. I was offered a most advantageous situation in an excellent art program. The lens was very clear at that moment. We accepted the offer and had a very challenging but valuable experience. I don't know what would have happened had I attended a different school, but I did know in that moment, as I do today, that our Father in Heaven watches over us and will guide us in important things when we seek His direction.<br><br>Several of our Church leaders have reminded us "that the Lord will speak to us through the Spirit in his own time and in his own way."<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/03/teaching-and-learning-by-the-spirit?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>28</sup></a>Answers to prayers or other righteous desires may not come immediately or may not come how we expect them to.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2001/04/plow-in-hope?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>29</sup></a>Exercising faith, we must submit ourselves to the will of the Lord and be patient. We should also understand that personal revelation is not constant and will not be given on every matter.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks cautioned:<br><br><i>The Spirit of the Lord is not likely to give us ­revelations on matters that are trivial. I once heard a young woman in testimony meeting praise the spirituality of her husband, indicating that he submitted every question to the Lord. She told how he accompanied her shopping and would not even choose between different brands of canned vegetables without making his selection a matter of prayer. That strikes me as improper. I believe the Lord expects us to use the intelligence and experience he has given us to make these kinds of choices.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks_revelation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>30</sup></a><br><br>Elder Oaks also taught:<br><br><i>Revelations from God--the teachings and directions of the Spirit--are not constant. We believe in continuing revelation, not continuous revelation. We are often left to work out problems without the dictation or specific direction of the Spirit. That is part of the experience we must have in mortality. Fortunately, we are never out of our Savior's sight, and if our judgment leads us to actions beyond the limits of what is permissible and if we are listening to the still, small voice, the Lord will restrain us by the promptings of his Spirit.</i><sup>31</sup><br><h2><b>Navigating the Darkness</b></h2><br>Some may question the purpose of this mortal condition in which the lens through which we see can be dark and unclear. They may ask, "Why does it have to be this way?" "Why is it that we have to so often struggle through the uncertainty, confusion, conflict, and pain of this world and this life?" I don't think there is a simple way to answer these questions completely, but let me share a few ideas.<br><br>We have been taught by holy prophets and through scripture that we are the spirit children of God and have great potential--even divine potential. Our Father in Heaven loves and has a plan for all of His children. It is His desire and work for all of us to become like He is, to be with Him again, and to have joy. For various reasons, many that I'm sure we don't comprehend, it was critical for us to gain a mortal body and to live in a state in which we are separated from Him--a state in which we have experiences and challenges that are unique to mortality and important for our growth. I suggest that this life is the only way to learn and develop important and necessary attributes of the divine.<br><br>It dawns on me now, as I look back on my experience welding in the bronze foundry many years ago, that the darkened glass lens of the welding helmet not only protected my eyes from the bright light of the arc welder but actually enabled my vision. It allowed me to see, understand, and do things that I would not have otherwise been capable of doing, given the physical limitations of my eyes. Perhaps this can give us some insight into the need for a dark glass in mortality, especially as we recognize the importance of cultivating the qualities of faith, hope, and charity, as the Apostle Paul taught in his epistle to the Corinthians.<sup>32</sup>As we prepare ourselves through righteousness and learn to rely on the light of the Holy Ghost, we have an increased ability to see clearly those things we need to know and do in our lives.<br><br>Elder Oaks has also taught:<br><br><i>As faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have a distinctive way of looking at life. We view our experiences in terms of eternity. As we draw farther from worldliness, we feel closer to our Father in Heaven and more able to be guided by his Spirit. We call this quality of life<b>spirituality.</b></i><br><br><i>To the faithful, spirituality is a lens through which we view life and a gauge by which we evaluate it. . . .</i><br><br><i>Each of us has a personal lens through which we<b>view</b>the world. Our lens gives its special tint to all we see. It can suppress some features and emphasize others. It can also reveal things otherwise invisible. Through the lens of spirituality, we can know "the things of God" by "the Spirit of God." (1 Cor. 2:11.) As the Apostle Paul taught, such things are "foolishness" to the "natural man." He cannot see them "because they are spiritually discerned." (See 1 Cor. 2:14.)</i><br><br><i>How we<b>interpret</b>our experiences is also a function of our degree of spirituality. Some interpret mortality solely in terms of worldly accomplishments and possessions. In contrast, we who have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ should interpret our experiences in terms of our knowledge of the purpose of life, the mission of our Savior, and the eternal destiny of the children of God.</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1985/10/spirituality?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>33</sup></a><br><br>President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>Often we do not have even a glimpse of our ­potential for happiness and accomplishment in this life and in eternity because, as the Apostle Paul said, "Now we see through a glass, darkly." But the lens can be lightened and become crystal clear through the influence of the Holy Ghost. The Savior promised us that the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, will "teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance," and "guide you into all truth."</i><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/04/it-can-t-happen-to-me?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>34</sup></a><br><br>Each of us has our own unique way of seeing that is influenced by many factors. There may be times when our paths seem very unclear. We will likely make mistakes. But as we repent, are faithful, and learn to recognize and rely on the light that is available to us through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost, the path that leads us to the presence of our Heavenly Father will be illuminated and our ability to see with an eternal perspective will be enhanced. For those who struggle to see and who feel they walk in darkness, our Savior has said, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."<sup>35</sup>As we follow our Savior, darkness will fade, and, step-by-step, we will receive that light that "groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<sup>36</sup>I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Gary Barton was an associate dean in the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications when this devotional address was given on 23July 2013.</i></i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 1 Corinthians 13:12.<br><br>2.

<h1>Your Ebenezer: A Monument to Remember - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of my favorite religious hymns was written in 1757 by Robert Robinson. The melodic stanzas of the song "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing" bring a certain reflective feeling that prompts me to ponder the love that God has for His children. Each time I hear this hymn I find myself humming the tune throughout the day with the words playing in my mind.<br><br>I have always found the first phrase of the second verse to be particularly curious: "Here I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I've come" ("Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Thou_Fount_of_Every_Blessing).<br><br>"Here I raise my Ebenezer"? What is the meaning behind this phrase? Certainly it is not a reference to the resurrection of the lead character in Charles Dickens'<i>A Christmas Carol--</i>Ebenezer Scrooge. But admittedly that was my only reference to the word.<br><br>It is in the Old Testament that we gain further understanding of what it means to "raise my Ebenezer." In 1 Samuel 7 we read that the Israelites were under attack by the Philistines. Outnumbered and in fear for their lives, they pled with the prophet Samuel to pray for God's help. Samuel offered a sacrifice and prayed for protection. In response the Lord smote the Philistines, and they retreated to their territory. This victory is recorded in verse 12: "Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."<br><br>In Hebrew the word<i>ebenezer</i>means "stone of help." This raised stone was a reminder to the Israelites of what the Lord had done for them. This Eben-ezer quite literally was a monument set to remember the great help that God granted the one raising the stone. The Old Testament is replete with examples of the children of Israel forgetting the many miracles and spiritual experiences given to them by the Lord.<br><br>In an address given to religious educators, President Spencer W. Kimball said that<i>remember</i>could be the most important word in the dictionary (see "Circles of Exaltation," BYU summer school devotional address, 28 June 1968, 8). This is a strong statement that gives us pause to reflect on why a modern-day prophet would make such a deliberate and specific reference to the importance of one word. Today my comments will be centered on this very principle--more specifically, on the importance and value of remembering our own spiritual experiences and recognizing that these experiences, given to us by the Lord, have brought us to where each of us is today. In other words, by remembering we are raising our own Ebenezer.<br><h2><b>Raising My Own Ebenezer</b></h2><br>One such experience in my life took place nearly thirty years ago when I was a young missionary serving in southern Chile. On a warm summer evening in a small Chilean village filled with humble homes linked by dirt roads, my companion and I were engaged in routine missionary activities. Tucked in my pocket was a trifold organizer that contained our calendar for the week. On this particular evening we were scheduled to teach the second discussion to a newly contacted family. We artfully dodged the barefoot children who were playing soccer in the streets. The smoke-filled air was evidence that most people were cooking their evening meal.<br><br>As we approached the small house, the children ran to alert their parents that we had arrived. We entered the humble home, and the family gathered for our lesson. In those days the second discussion was the plan of salvation--one of my favorites. As the lesson progressed I made eye contact with the mother and the father and shared my testimony of the truthfulness of this plan. The normally energetic children sat quietly on the knees of their parents. We spoke about how they had lived before coming to earth and about God's plan for how they could return to live with Him and their family forever.<br><br>As my companion gave his portion of the discussion, I had a profound experience. The Spirit touched my heart in a way I had never felt before. At that very moment I could see with great clarity that this family had divine potential. I was overcome with the Spirit and remember feeling that the Holy Ghost was bearing witness to me in a very personal way that the work I was engaged in was true and that God was the author of this plan of salvation.<br><br>I did not know at the time if this family was having the same experience, but my feelings were undeniably from God. The sweet witness was profound and clear. At the conclusion of the discussion I felt an urgency to get back to my apartment and record this special experience in my journal. I did not want to forget one detail.<br><br>That evening I carefully wrote about my experience, making special note of the spiritual confirmations I had received. I concluded my journal entry that night with the following sentence: "If someday in the future I ever find myself questioning my faith, please read this journal entry!" This experience is an example of a monument that I raised to help me remember what Heavenly Father had done for me.<br><h2><b>"What Mean These Stones?"</b></h2><br>I remember as a child that each year during the month of April our family would gather around the television on Sunday evenings and watch the annual showing of Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 production of<i>The Ten Commandments.</i>Visions of Charlton Heston standing on the mountain with his arms raised high above his head, holding the stone tablets as the wind blew his silver-white hair and red robes, are still present in my memory. Keep in mind that this was before VCR and DVR machines; there was no pausing and no rewinding. It was only during the commercial breaks that we had time to grab a snack or run to get a blanket. Somehow this immediacy made the movie even more exciting to watch. After all, if you missed something you would have to wait another year before you could see it again.<br><br>Who could forget the most glorious scene of the movie, when Moses raised his staff and parted the Red Sea? The special effects that were used are impressive even today. With age, my understanding of the story increased, and I began to wonder how the children of Israel could forget so many amazing miracles and return to wickedness.<br><br>A lesser-known--but equally meaningful--story of the children of Israel takes place on the banks of the River Jordan. In Joshua 3 we read that, after many years of wandering through the wilderness, the children of Israel were poised to enter the promised land. With Joshua as their leader, the Israelites experienced yet another miracle.<br><br>The Lord spoke to Joshua: "This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee" (Joshua 3:7).<br><br>As the children of Israel approached the banks of the River Jordan, Joshua was commanded that twelve men--one from each tribe of Israel--should carry the ark of the covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, into the River Jordan. Verse 17 gives a description of what happened as these men walked into the river: "And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan."<br><br>Once again the Lord miraculously parted the waters for the children of Israel. However, this time the Lord had additional instructions. After the children of Israel had crossed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua and commanded him that a representative of each tribe pick up a large stone from the dry river bed and stack the stones as a memorial to remember what God had done for them.<br><br><i>And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</i><br><br><i>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over.</i> [Joshua 4:21–23]<br><br>It seems the Lord recognized the tendency of the natural man to quickly forget his God. Perhaps this monument would help the Israelites remember the Lord and turn their hearts to Him. I also find it particularly significant that this scripture references that this monument, built by the Israelites, would also stand as a witness to their children, who might ask of its meaning.<br><br>This story has great application for us even today. Each experience that we have with the Spirit can be like placing a stone on our own personal monument, reminding us of God's hand in our lives. These monuments can also serve to strengthen others as we share our experiences.<br><br>Some of us may have large, stable monuments that are continually built and fortified with great personal spiritual experiences that acknowledge God. Others may believe that their monuments are small or insignificant--maybe even eroding. If you have these feelings, I invite you to do two things.<br><br>First, look to your past and reflect upon your life. You will see the divine guidance of our Heavenly Father and how He has brought you to where you are today.<br><br>Second, earnestly seek opportunities and environments in which the Spirit can touch your heart.<br><h2><b>Reflect upon the Past</b></h2><br>As we look to our past we gain insight. Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard proclaimed: "Life must be understood backwards. But . . . it must be lived forwards" (journal entry, 1843). Understanding life by looking backward invites us to reflect upon our past. As we do this with a proper spiritual perspective, we can more clearly see that perhaps seemingly insignificant experiences from our past have set us on a specific path.<br><br>Each of us was born into this world with the Light of Christ, and most of us have been given the gift of the Holy Ghost. At some point you have felt the presence of God. Maybe it was through a small prompting to make a particular decision, or maybe you felt a simple witness when someone bore testimony. By recognizing these experiences you are building your own monument. If we do not reflect upon these moments, then we risk forgetting that they ever happened--like the children of Israel did. Allow me to share a personal experience of how an almost-forgotten event in my past suddenly had new meaning.<br><br>In my current role as a teacher I have the opportunity to work with students over the course of several years. Through these prolonged associations I have the chance to get to know these students on a more personal level. It is with the permission of one such former student that I share the following story.<br><br>In most ways Julie was a typical student. She was bright and articulate, and she enjoyed all the blessings of being raised in the restored gospel. I knew a little of her family background. Her parents were former mission presidents and her siblings were strong in the faith. Julie married a wonderful man who had also been raised in the gospel. I was surprised that they didn't choose the temple to make their marital covenants, nor did they embrace the gospel in their new life together. I often thought of Julie and her husband and would occasionally see them around town with their growing family. I wondered how they were doing and if they would once again embrace the gospel.<br><br>Several years ago I spent an extended amount of time in Nauvoo. I enjoyed visiting the historical sites of the Church and was particularly touched as I stood on the property of one of my ancestors, a pioneer of the Church--James Sawyer Holman. I marveled at the roster that showed the date when he received his temple endowments in the Nauvoo Temple. It became very clear to me that the unwavering faith of James Sawyer Holman and other ancestors had provided me with the blessings of the restored gospel. In my mind's eye I could see that I was the last link in the chain of a long line of faithful members of the Church. I pondered how different my life would be if one of those ancestors had made different choices. Suddenly it occurred to me that my responsibility was to remain strong in my faith not only for my sake but also for the sake of my children and my posterity. In a new way I understood that my decisions didn't just affect me.<br><br>Several days later, while sitting in my apartment, I continued to ponder this personal revelation. Suddenly the name of this former student--Julie--came to my mind. It had been years since I had seen Julie and her husband or had even thought about them. The thought came to my mind that I should share these thoughts with them, that I should tell them they are links in their own chain for their own posterity. At first I pushed aside these feelings, but as they persisted I followed through and began to write a thoughtful letter. I admit I questioned if what I felt was truly a spiritual prompting or just my own thoughts. I finished the letter and reluctantly sent it, not knowing if I had overstepped my bounds. I received no response.<br><br>Several years have passed since I sent the letter, and the original circumstances are now far from my memory. A few months ago my wife came home from the grocery store and said that she had bumped into Julie while shopping.<br><br>During their conversation Julie said, "Please tell your husband thank you for the letter he wrote many years ago about being a strong link in our chain. He should know that my husband and I are now married in the temple. My husband is the elders quorum president in our ward, and I am serving in the Young Women organization. We now have an eternal family."<br><br>At first when I was told this I didn't recall writing the letter, but upon further reflection I did remember the strong feelings many years ago that resulted in my writing the letter. For me this experience is a stone added to my personal monument--one that helps me remember the importance of following the promptings of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>Actively Seek to Feel the Spirit</b></h2><br>Elder Steven E. Snow of the Quorum of the Seventy said:<br><br><i>When it comes to our own gospel progression, we cannot rely alone on our long-term memory. That is why in all our remembering we must remember to renew. Our testimonies must be continually fed with new spiritual experiences.</i>["Remembering and Renewing," audio, BYU–Idaho devotional address, 12 September 2006]<br><br>If my testimony is based upon one spiritual experience I had thirty years ago on my mission, then my testimony is at risk and my monument is in danger of eroding. We must actively seek opportunities and place ourselves in environments where we can feel of the Spirit.<br><br>The following example illustrates the importance of choosing to participate in activities and be in environments where the Spirit can be present. Not too long ago my teenage daughter had an opportunity to attend a routine Church fireside on a Sunday evening. I am sure that you will not be surprised when I tell you that this teenager was not excited about getting dressed up again to go to "yet another" Church meeting. However, with constant prodding from her mother and me, she decided to attend.<br><br>When she returned home I asked, "So how was the fireside?"<br><br>She replied, "It was<i>so</i>good. I am really glad that I went."<br><br>She enjoyed the blessings of the Spirit because she placed herself in an environment where the Spirit could be present. Had she not attended the fireside she would have missed an opportunity to build her faith. Choosing to attend your church meetings, attend the temple regularly, read the scriptures, and even attend university devotionals makes it more likely for you to have spiritual experiences. After all, it is hard for the Spirit to bear witness to us of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon if we aren't reading it.<br><br>The inspired document "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" states that "successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102). As parents, our favorite part of this statement is "forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, [and] work." However, our kids really like the "recreational activities" part.<br><br>Over the years we have enjoyed some very exciting and fun family vacations. In an effort to add value and excitement to the vacation, we have often made the actual announcement of the vacation an event itself. For example, when we traveled to Florida to visit Disney World, we cut out magazine pictures of things like palm trees, the Everglades, and alligators. Each week during family home evening we would present one of these pictures, and the children would try to guess where we were going. Prior to a family vacation to New York we gave the children "I Love New York" T-shirts and had them put them on while in the dark. Then, on the count of three we turned on the lights to reveal the summer vacation plans. It was a thrill to see the excitement in the faces of our children when they discovered where we were headed.<br><br>This summer we decided our vacation would be different. Rather than just take a vacation, we wanted to have an experience. We applied to be in the Hill Cumorah Pageant in Palmyra, New York. As parents, we knew that this would be a wonderful experience for our family and an opportunity for them to feel of the Spirit as they portrayed the sacred stories of the Book of Mormon on the very hill where the gold plates had been buried. We also knew that it might not sound as exciting as Disney World or New York City, so we intentionally decided to just let these vacation plans slip out in casual conversation.<br><br>My conversation with my fourteen-year-old son went something like this: "Hey, by the way, your Mom and I are so excited that our family has been accepted to be part of the Hill Cumorah Pageant this summer. We will be spending seventeen days in Palmyra, New York. Isn't that great?"<br><br>I curiously awaited his response. As expected, the plans did not elicit the normal outburst of excitement. All I got was a blank stare.<br><br>After a long pause he gave me a thoughtful and respectful response. "Dad, no offense," he said, "but this kind of reminds me of being in second grade, when the teacher comes into class all excited about a field trip to a museum and we just have to slap a smile on our faces and pretend we're excited as well." He finished up the conversation by saying, "Are you sure that you and Mom aren't just wanting to relive your performing glory days?"<br><br>I assured him that was not our intent. Quite the opposite, our hope was that our participation in the pageant would place our children in an environment in which they would have an opportunity to have their very own personal and meaningful spiritual experiences. It would be a way for them to build their own testimony and place a stone in their own monument that they would always remember.<br><br>The day we arrived at the pageant was particularly hot and humid. We gathered for instructions on how the event would unfold. Within moments we were alive with the idea of portraying the stories of the Book of Mormon on the Hill Cumorah. The children were excited as they received their roles, tried on costumes, and began rehearsals. Those seventeen days were filled with opportunities to feel of the Spirit as we reenacted scenes from the Book of Mormon, visited the Sacred Grove, and relived details of the restored gospel.<br><h2><b>"Remember, and Perish Not"</b></h2><br>Each night as I watched the production unfold from backstage under a starlit sky, I was reminded how much of the turmoil and strife in the Book of Mormon was the result of the people not remembering. Even though Laman and Lemuel had seen angels and had had other heavenly manifestations, they seemingly forgot them and constantly murmured against their father and their brother. In their case the inability to remember resulted in an entire nation turning from God.<br><br>Former Church historian and recorder Elder Marlin K. Jensen emphasized the importance of remembering. He said:<br><br><i>If we pay close attention to the uses of the word<b>remember</b>in the holy scriptures, we will recognize that remembering in the way God intends is a fundamental and saving principle of the gospel. This is so because prophetic admonitions to remember are frequently calls to action: to listen, to see, to do, to obey, to repent. When we remember in God's way, we overcome our human tendency simply to gird for the battle of life and actually engage in the battle itself, doing all in our power to resist temptation and avoid sinning.</i>["Remember and Perish Not,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2007, 36]<br><br>When we think of remembering, it is easy to conjure up an image of an aged man in a rocking chair recalling events of the past. Elder Jensen reminded us that remembering is not enough. Those memories must propel us to action and to continually seek to do the will of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>In the book of Mosiah, King Benjamin gave a warning:<br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i>[Mosiah 4:30]<br><br>These final words--"remember, and perish not"--underscore the plea of prophets both modern and old that if we do not want to perish, we must remember. On a personal level this means that our memories of God's hand in our lives are not only monuments to God but also living testaments that He loves us and is aware of each one of our personal needs.<br><br>One of the final scenes of the pageant is the portrayal of the destruction of the Nephite nation. With bodies strewn about the stage and smoke filling the air, Mormon hands the plates to Moroni. Later there is a final plea from Moroni:<br><br><i>And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?</i>[Moroni 10:27]<br><br>A week ago today we returned from the pageant. My once-skeptical son is now earnestly asking if we could please do this again. As we traveled home we all exchanged our favorite quotes from the now-memorized script and spoke of the memories that we would carry with us. We all felt a renewed commitment to nurture future spiritual experiences. In an effort to follow Moroni's exhortation "to remember these things," we took time together as a family to write down in our journals what we had experienced and how we felt. These delicate, precious memories deserved all our efforts to preserve them. After all, it is possible that the very recollection of these moments at a yet undetermined time in the future might provide much-needed strength. This experience certainly served as a very large stone in each of our monuments to remember.<br><br>As Robert Robinson penned the last verse of "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing," he noted the tendency of man forget God:<br><br><i>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br>Prone to leave the God I love;<br>Here's my heart, O take and seal it;<br>Seal it for Thy courts above.</i><br>["Come Thou Fount"]<br><br>The author of this song died in 1790. It is believed that he had also wandered from the God he loved. A widely told but unverifiable story relates that while he was riding in a stagecoach, a lady passenger sitting next to him was humming the tune of this now well-known hymn. Robinson turned to the lady and responded, saying, "Madam, I am the poor unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds, if I had them, to enjoy the feelings I had then" (see Kenneth W. Osbeck,<i>101 Hymn Stories: The Inspiring True Stories Behind 101 Favorite Hymns</i> [Grand Rapids, Michigan: Kregel Publications, 1982], 52).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I testify that as we seek opportunities to feel of the Spirit and make efforts to reflect often upon those experiences, we will raise our own Ebenezers--our own stones of remembrance--that will enable us to see God's hand in our past and will give us assurance and faith that He will provide for us in the future.<br><br>I share these things with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Curt Holman was associate chair of the BYU Department of Dance when this devotional address was given on 30July 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>h of Souls Is Great - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, friends. A few months ago I had the opportunity to travel to Italy for the first time. While there I saw art created by the great masters: Michelangelo, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and many others. In Milan I was able to see the famed<i>The Last Supper</i>of Leonardo da Vinci. This mural is in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, and to see it one must purchase tickets ahead of time and wait for one's fifteen minutes with the painting. When my time drew near, I was corralled with twenty-four others into a waiting area, guided through two air-locked chambers, and finally allowed in front of the painting for fifteen minutes of communion.<br><br>As I sat there I contemplated the painting and why it is considered priceless--the value of which is beyond measure. Is it because the painting is old, created in the fifteenth century? Is it because of where it is located--in Milan? Is it because access is limited--few people can see it, so it is more valuable than paintings just anyone can see? Is it because it has been threatened in the past--like when Napoleon used the convent as an armory, a prison, and a stable or when it was partially destroyed by bombs during World War II? Is it because it was painted in an unconventional style--on a dry wall versus in the wet plaster--making it more fragile and rare? Is it because of who painted it--the great master da Vinci? Is it because of its subject?<br><br>These questions and others I chewed on while sitting and looking at this painting. I'd like to say that I came up with profound answers that shook me to my core, but instead I came up with more questions. How do we measure value? What makes something--and, more important, someone--of worth?<br><h2><b>Defining Value</b></h2><br>As a professor of literature and culture, it is my job to look at systems of meaning and value, language being the first and foremost. If we go to the<i>Oxford English Dictionary--</i>the fifth standard work for all English majors--excerpts from the entry for the word<i>value</i>(n) read:<br><br><i>• worth or quality as measured by a standard of equivalence</i><br><i>• a standard of estimation or exchange</i><br><i>•</i>[something]<i>worth having</i><br><i>• material or monetary worth of something</i><br><i>• an appraisement</i><br><i>• relative rank or importance</i><br><i>• worth based on esteem</i><br><i>• estimation</i>[based on]<i>real or supposed desirability or utility</i>[later extended]<i>to an individual or group</i><br><i>• opinion of or liking for a person or thing</i><br><i>• worth or worthiness . . . in respect of rank</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>According to these definitions, a thing's value is contingent on ideas of estimation, desirability, likeability, and worthiness. It is at the center of the word<i>evaluate--</i>to analyze--yet often we do not ask the questions, Who determines the system of value by which we are considering, classifying, and ranking people or things? Who determines the mechanism of evaluation and the indices of what is evaluated? Who sets the "standard of equivalence" that says some things have greater worth than others?<br><br>As human beings, one of the things that we do to understand our world is to create systems of meaning that help us organize the sensations, experiences, and objects we encounter. I remember a time when I was reading with my oldest nephew, Connor, as he was learning different categories of animals--how a dog is not a cow and a cow is not a zebra. What the animal looked like, how it sounded, and what it ate all factored in as he learned how to identify these different species. Similarly, we have created categories such as nationality, race, ethnicity, sex, religious affiliation, political party, marital status, and so on to organize and make sense of humankind's diversity. However, too often we use these seemingly descriptive systems to determine the worth of others. These human-made hierarchies of value can cause division, contention, and skewed understandings of self-worth.<br><br>Conversely, God's system of valuing us promotes connection, compassion, and love. We are His children. He loves us unconditionally, eternally, and unchangingly. Our worth is infinite because we are His daughters and sons. No one spirit is more valuable than the other. So why, then, do we fall short of loving and "measuring right" God's children? We read in Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 that "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God," but do we really believe that, or do we bookmark that scripture in our minds as only for missionary purposes? Today I'd like to reflect upon how we might better align how we value others with how the Lord values His children so that we might be true disciples of Christ.<br><h2><b>What Are You Worth?</b></h2><br>"So what are you worth?" This is a question I overheard as I may or may not have been eavesdropping on a recent flight. (In my defense, it is hard not to hear everything going on around you on a plane.) In response to the question, the petitioned gentleman cited portfolio figures, property holdings, and his net financial wealth. My first thought was, "Holy cow! I hope nobody measures my worth by what's in my savings account; otherwise I'm in trouble." Then I sat and thought more about how externalities like wealth are used to ascribe value to individuals. I was reminded of Edith Wharton's novel<i>The Age of Innocence.</i>In this text Wharton satirizes the intricate set of codes that the very wealthy used to dictate behavior and measure worth in Gilded Age New York. People who abided by these strict codes were accepted into high society as a valued member. Those who did not or could not abide by these codes were dismissed as vulgar, low class, and--the worst of all designations--"unpleasant."<br><br>When I teach this novel my students have no trouble laughing at these characters and their shallowness. But we as early twenty-first-century folk too have codes that separate the "hots" from the "nots" (to quote a Facebook page that has been in the local news recently). As a class we started to identify various markers or codes that could be used to rank others and came up with a list: what people wear, what cell phone they have, what laptop they use, what car they drive, what bands they listen to, what size their jeans are, what status their relationship is in, what apartment complex they live in, what films they watch, what facial hair they grow, and so on. My students found that these things that seemingly describe actually<i>prescribe</i>certain behaviors and beliefs deemed important to acceptance and worth.<br><br>Oftentimes we are unaware that we are ascribing worth to people in ways that contradict or challenge our professed beliefs as Christians. Wealth, physical appearance, education, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religious affiliation, and political party are just some categories that can be used to lift some folks up and bring others down. Whether we like to admit it or not, it is human to rank and ascribe value to others, and more often than not we ascribe higher value to people who are like us than to those who are different. It is now cliché to say this, but we fear what we don't know, so difference is made suspect or "bad," whereas familiarity breeds comfort, so sameness becomes more valuable. In addition, fear of coming up short or fear of not being enough often propels these negative behaviors. Because we fear we are somehow less, we seek to elevate ourselves above others to convince ourselves that we are valuable.<br><h2><b>False Systems of Value</b></h2><br>Where do these systems that evaluate worth come from? These systems are neither eternal nor transcendent but are human creations based on place and time that, more often than not, benefit those in positions of power who have created these systems.<br><br>For example, pseudoscientific ideas of racial superiority elevating Anglo-Saxons above all others were perpetuated for centuries in order to justify devaluing and dehumanizing persons of color so that their land might be seized and their bodies be used as slaves or subjects. Until recently, social narratives said that humans in possession of two X chromosomes were intellectually inferior, predisposed to emotional irrationality, and incapable of governing others--let alone governing themselves. This valuation barred women from holding property, gaining an education, voting in elections, and participating in the public sphere.<br><br>These human systems by which human beings have been evaluated, categorized, and ranked have changed with time and place. Obviously these systems that elevate some and denigrate others are destructive and have led to wars, enslavement, and discrimination--violence of a social and global scale.<br><br>These false systems of value also have a negative impact on a smaller scale--on the individual and his or her sense of self-worth and place in the community. Being told that you are less, that you'll never fit in or add up, or that you'll be accepted only when you change who you are is destructive emotionally, spiritually, and, at times, physically.<br><br>One system of valuation that has negative consequences for feelings of individual worth is beauty. Human beings go to great lengths to achieve some ideal beauty--extreme workouts, plastic surgery, eating disorders, elaborate makeup rituals, extensive hair and nail treatments, and compulsive shopping. All of these behaviors stem from the desire to be beautiful because we are taught to believe that beautiful people are more valuable than others.<br><br>Here in Utah we are not immune to this trend. In November 2007<i>Forbes</i>magazine named Salt Lake City the vainest city in America because it had more plastic surgeons and used more beauty products per capita than any other large city in the United States.<sup>2</sup>Drive down I-15 and you'll see sign after sign offering to fix how you look to make a better you. Scroll through a Facebook feed or watch one commercial break during prime-time television viewing hours and you'll see several examples in which bodies are objectified, shamed, and tied to one's individual worth. If we are prisoners in the wasteland that is reality TV, we are subjected to scores of plastic surgery shows, makeover shows, "dating" shows, and dangerous weight-loss competitions inundating us with the message that one can never be beautiful enough and that happiness is predicated upon one's skin, teeth, hair, weight, shape, and wardrobe. We read in 1 Samuel 16:7 that "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart"--and our modern culture's obsession with beauty indeed confirms that.<br><br>This obsession is not without its costs. In a general conference talk Elder Jeffrey R. Holland remarked on this false system of value and its destructive nature, pleading with women young and old:<br><br><i>Please be more accepting of yourselves, including your body shape and style, with a little less longing to look like someone else. We are all different. . . . If you are obsessing over being a size 2, you won't be very surprised when your daughter or the Mia Maid in your class does the same and makes herself physically ill trying to accomplish it. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . It is spiritually destructive, and it accounts for much of the unhappiness women, including young women, face in the modern world. And if adults are preoccupied with appearance--tucking and nipping and implanting and remodeling everything that can be remodeled--those pressures and anxieties will certainly seep through to children. At some point the problem becomes what the Book of Mormon called "vain imaginations."</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>As Elder Holland said, this preoccupation with appearance and this socially constructed idea of beauty as that by which we find worth or value is physically and spiritually destructive--and it isn't just limited to women. Men too have to negotiate pressures of appearance, and eating disorders, exercise bulimia, and psychological troubles associated with achieving beauty are on the rise among men.<br><br>Are beautiful people better people? Does God love them more? I am sure we would all respond with a resounding no; however, do you say no when you look in the mirror and criticize yourself or when you criticize others for their appearance? Do we believe what we say? Remember: ideal beauty is a construction of this world. We can point to the usual suspects for this false system of value--the fashion industry, advertising, television, and so on. And yes, we are bombarded with images that say, "This is beautiful. If you are this, you will be popular, you will be important, you will be datable, you will be marriageable, you will be worth loving." While we know this to be false, the rates of "tucking and nipping and implanting and remodeling," as Elder Holland said, and the rates of eating disorders and depression among college students on this campus and others tell us that this is very real.<br><h2><b>Loving Thy Neighbor</b></h2><br>One of my favorite works of literature is Lorraine Hansberry's play<i>A Raisin in the Sun.</i>This play examines the ways in which socially constructed categories of worth can grind down individuals and offers a corrective. The Younger family is poor and black, living in Southside Chicago after World War II. The degradations of racist housing and hiring practices have worn them out, eating away at familial relationships and draining each individual of hope.<br><br>At the beginning of the third act the Younger family is reeling from the news that Walter Lee Younger's actions have lost the small inheritance that could have helped them better their situation. His sister, Beneatha, turns against him, saying he is no longer a man but "a toothless rat."<br><br>Her mother corrects her, reminding her that she taught her to love him, to which Beneatha replies, "Love him? There is nothing left to love." Indeed, the oppressive weight of racism has told the Youngers that they are worth nothing so many times that they are starting to believe it.<br><br>Yet Mama rightly says in this memorable speech:<br><br><i>There is</i>always<i>something left to love. . . . Child, when do you think is the time to love somebody the most? When they done good and made things easy for everybody? Well then, you ain't through learning--because that ain't the time at all. It's when he's at his lowest and can't believe in hisself 'cause the world done whipped him so! When you starts measuring somebody, measure him right, child, measure him right. Make sure you done taken into account what hills and valleys he come through before he got to wherever he is.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Mama reminds Beneatha that all individuals are of worth, that there is always something to love, and that we must rethink how we measure each other. Ultimately she argues that correct measurement is not contingent on external factors but instead is based upon one's immutable worth as a human being. And for Mama, a practicing Christian, there's more: worth cannot be diminished and there is always something to love because all are children of God.<br><br>Heavenly Father knew that we would have trouble with this. Indeed, the scriptures are full of commands to resist the human impulse to rank people and instead to see them as God does. For example, Leviticus contains several injunctions to the Israelites to accept and love all those among them. We read:<br><br><i>And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</i><br><br><i>But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</i>[Leviticus 19:33–34]<br><br>God commanded the Israelites to look past human-made constructions of nationality or religious practice and to see and love a "stranger" as "one born among you." He commanded that we not vex others we perceive as different. He asked that we recognize that us/them divisions are artificial because<i>all</i>are God's children. He also reminded the Israelites that they too were strangers and that we<i>all</i>are strangers at one point or another in our lives. If God did and could show mercy to them--His children--then so should they to others.<br><br>Before that, God commanded the Israelites to "love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord" (Leviticus 19:18). There are no caveats here--no "love thy neighbor unless he is X, Y, or Z"--but a command for total inclusion. The final statement "I am the Lord" underscores who is speaking and distinguishes the divine commandment to love inclusively from the human tendency to distinguish, evaluate, discriminate, and tolerate.<br><h2><b>Brothers and Sisters in God</b></h2><br>One of my least favorite words is<i>tolerate</i>because its popular usage assigns a superiority to the speaker and an inferiority to the object of their speech. You tolerate somebody else's person, beliefs, or actions, which implies that your own person, beliefs, or actions are superior. Yet this is not the Lord's way, and our leaders have pointed this out to us. In a CES devotional Elder Dallin H. Oaks defined tolerance "as a friendly and fair attitude toward unfamiliar opinions and practices or toward the persons who hold or practice them."<sup>5</sup>Note the words<i>friendly</i>and<i>fair</i>in this definition. Elder Oaks also asked us "to be more thoughtful about the nature of tolerance," stressing that "all . . . are brothers and sisters under God" and, as such, deserve respect.<sup>6</sup><br><br><i>Mutual respect</i>is the term that Elder Russell M. Nelson used in a general conference talk on tolerance, citing a recent statement by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that read: "We sincerely believe that as we acknowledge one another with consideration and compassion we will discover that we can all peacefully coexist despite our deepest differences."<sup>7</sup>"Consideration and compassion"--not condescension--are the attributes our leaders invite us to magnify.<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said in his address "You Are My Hands":<br><br><i>When I think of the Savior, I often picture Him with hands outstretched, reaching out to comfort, heal, bless, and love. And He always talked</i>with,<i>never</i>down to,<i>people. He loved the humble and meek and walked among them, ministering to them and offering hope and salvation.</i><br><br><i>That is what He did during His mortal life; it is what He would be doing if He were living among us today; and it is what we should be doing as His disciples and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>The connotation of<i>tolerate</i>that suggests judgment, condescension, and distaste does not work with the Lord's example of talking<i>with</i>versus down to people and His injunction to love all liberally, withholding nothing. As He and our leaders have taught, compassion, respect, fairness, friendliness, and thoughtfulness mark how we should look upon difference of opinion, beliefs, and position in life, for, as Elder Oaks said, all are brothers and sisters in God.<br><br>Christ Himself refused to recognize distinctions of class, nationality, race, gender, politics, or faith among people but instead saw each individual as a child of God worthy of His time, service, teachings, and love. When a diseased woman who was shunned by all others approached Him for help and took hold of His garment, He neither condemned nor dismissed her but blessed her (see Luke 8:43–48). When a fallen woman approached Him to wash His feet, Christ didn't chastise her but instead accepted her act of charity (see Luke 7:37–38). When the Pharisees criticized Him for dining with a publican--a man who represented the wrong profession, the wrong politics, and an alien occupying nation--Christ rebuked them saying that His word and His love was for all (see Mark 2:15–17; Luke 15:1–2). Finally, when Jesus saw the Samaritan woman at the well He did not shun her as taboo would demand for being a woman and a Samaritan but spoke to her, taught her, and loved her (see John 4:5–42).<br><br>Likewise, Christ's parables teach that we need to see beyond human-created divisions that classify and evaluate people in order to see them for who and what they are: children of God. The good Samaritan in Luke 10 is a perfect example of this. We all know the story: Before the Samaritan came along, a priest and a Levite passed the injured man by. Along came a Samaritan. This alleged enemy of Israel could have said, "Oh, this guy is a foreigner," "This guy is my enemy," "This guy is from another church," or "Somebody else should take care of him because he is not my problem nor worth my time." Instead of seeing these differences and divisions, the Samaritan saw this man as a human being of worth and acted on that vision. It was this man from the outside--this stranger--who had compassion on the robbed man, binding up his wounds and providing for his shelter and further care.<br><br>Using this parable Christ taught that we need to love and care for all people--not just those like us--because all are of worth to Him. Furthermore, since He is sharing this lesson with His disciples, He is teaching that a measure of our discipleship to Him is how we treat all others. Do we pass judgment on and pass over others? Or do we stop to aid and minister unto them?<br><h2><b>Becoming True Disciples of Christ</b></h2><br>This reminds me of something the French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir wrote: "One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation, [and] compassion."<sup>9</sup>Now, I would argue that all lives have value but that our value as disciples of Christ depends upon how we attribute value to the lives of others. If we devalue, demean, denigrate, or dismiss others, we diminish our discipleship and destroy that which makes us human: compassion. But when we value others, we not only demonstrate the best that humanity is but we also magnify our discipleship.<br><br>Time and time again in the scriptures prophets, apostles, and the Lord Himself call us to love all people. Here are a few examples. As read earlier, Leviticus 19:18 tells us to "love thy neighbour as thyself"--a command reiterated in Matthew 19:19. In the gospel of John we read the words that have become a beloved hymn in the Latter-day Saint community:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35; see "Love One Another,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, 308]<br><br>The direct occasion for this command is Christ counseling His disciples and preparing them for the proselytizing work they are to do. Yet this command also extends to us, His disciples in the latter days. If we believe in Him we must extend love one to another--and not just to those within the body of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but to all of His children on this earth. If we believe in Him we will do as Nephi asked: we will "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and<i>of all men [and women]</i>" (2 Nephi 31:20; emphasis added). If we believe in Him, we will do as the people of King Benjamin did and "give thanks to the Lord their God [and] rejoice and be filled with love towards God<i>and all men [and women]</i>" (Mosiah 2:4; emphasis added).<br><br>The scriptures repeatedly tell us that discipleship means loving one another. Again, there is no qualification here: the scriptures do not say, "Love God and all men and women, except for those who are or do X." No, we are commanded to love<i>all</i>men and women if we are to be counted among Christ's disciples.<br><br>In<i>Institutes of the Christian Religion,</i>Christian reformer John Calvin spoke of true discipleship and its requirement to recognize all humans as children of God worthy of love. Calvin took on various arguments propping up false systems of valuation, disarming them with the gospel of love. He wrote:<br><br><i>Say he is a stranger. The Lord has given him a mark which ought to be familiar to you: for which reason he forbids you to despise your own flesh (Gal. vi. 10). Say he is mean and of no consideration. The Lord points him out as one whom he has distinguished by the lustre of his own image (Isaiah lviii. 7). Say that you are bound to him by no ties of duty. The Lord has substituted him as it were into his own place, that in him you may recognise the many great obligations under which the Lord has laid you to himself. Say that he is unworthy of your least exertion on his account; but the image of God, by which he is recommended to you, is worthy of yourself and all your exertions. But if he not only merits no good, but has provoked you by injury and mischief, still this is no good reason why you should not embrace him in love, and visit him with offices of love.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>What Calvin repeats over and over is that the image and grace of God are found in all those whom we would dismiss or denigrate. He also stresses that we are all connected and none is better than another. And because all humans are children of God, all deserve our affection and "offices of love." Or, to come back to President Uchtdorf's talk, because all have God's image engraved upon their countenances and Christ's sacrifice inscribed upon their souls, all are called to be His hands--to serve, to embrace, to welcome, to fellowship, to comfort, and to lift up others. We read in Moroni 8:16 that "perfect love casteth out all fear." Love of God and our fellow men and women dispels our fear of difference and of not measuring up. It sanctifies us, giving us even greater capacity to love.<br><br>This is the message of my favorite book of scripture, 1 John. In this epistle the author maps out the nature of God's love and the love that is true discipleship:<br><br><i>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</i><br><br><i>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</i><br><br><i>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</i><br><br><i>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</i><br><br><i>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. ...</i><br><br><i>. . . God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him....</i><br><br><i>We love him, because he first loved us.</i><br><br><i>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</i><br><br><i>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</i>[1 John 4:7–11, 16, 19–21]<br><br>God loves us because we are His children and we are of infinite worth. Because He loves us and has blessed us with His grace, we are commanded to see all others as children of God and to love them--to love our brothers and sisters. This epistle calls us out for our potential hypocrisy: if we say we love God but then demean others, we do not really love God because such love would banish ill will from our hearts. As we read in John, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). "God so loved the world"--not parts of the world or certain people living in this world, but the whole world--that he gave us His Son, which was a huge sacrifice on His part. And in return He asks that we sacrifice our petty divisions, toxic sectarianism, and false hierarchies of value to recognize the worth of each human being and child of God.<br><br>The<i>why</i>of loving is clear--the<i>how</i>is sometimes less so. Loving all of God's children requires humility and a desire to do so. It means that we have to shift how we look at others so that we no longer see people as demographics but as children of God. This does not come easily or right away but requires persistence and hard work. Sometimes we may fail, but if we do we must forgive ourselves and try again as we strive to become better disciples.<br><h2><b>Your Infinite Value</b></h2><br>So what are you worth? I hope you know that you are above and beyond those false measures of worth that we humans have created. You have an infinite value that has nothing to do with what your portfolio contains, what size you wear, what party you vote, what color your skin is, what your gender is, and so on. Why? First, because you are a human being, and all human beings have value. Second, because you are a child of heavenly parents who love you and see you for the valuable person you are.<br><br>It is my testimony that God is love, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of love, and that true discipleship requires sharing that love with all people. It is my hope that we will be able to recognize and reject those false systems of value that demean and divide and instead embrace the love that is true discipleship. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kristin L.

<h1>the Lord Am With You&quot; - August 2013 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, graduates of the BYU summer commencement of 2013, what a magnificent sight you are to see--you who have stayed up late, gotten up early, worked hard, studied much, and made time for missions, marriages, families, and service amid the press of learning at one of the finest institutions in this nation.<br><br>Also in this audience are your families and close friends who have stood by you, encouraged you, and prayed for you. We pay tribute to them also, and we are all blessed to be together.<br><br>President Cecil Samuelson, Church commissioner of education Elder Paul V. Johnson, and professors and administrators from across this campus, to be invited by the First Presidency to speak here today is truly an honor for my family and for me.<br><br>Although I did not attend Brigham Young University, I have become a very enthusiastic fan. I have had the opportunity to sit in these seats in the Marriott Center as a proud parent of five children who have attended the Y and four who have graduated. Three of my BYU graduate daughters are here today. Rachelle, Jenessa, and Shannon, please stand up and let me honor you. I can tell you from experience, there is nothing like this day.<br><br>There is a reason this day is called<i>commencement.</i>You now embark on a new life. Your degree is much more than an honor hanging on the wall or a memory to recall with perhaps a sigh of relief. It is a statement that you have persevered and achieved, knowing that your purpose here fits into the Lord's plan for your life. My hope and prayer today is that through scriptural examples and a few of my own experiences I can share some lessons learned that may be of benefit to you.<br><br>I came from a middle-class family. My father drove a delivery truck for a bread company and was a member of the Teamsters' Union. Dad and Mom were not able to finish college, so for the children in our family, attending college and graduating was a very important goal set in our home.<br><br>You are fulfilling a goal set early in your life, which is a great accomplishment. Let it be an example to you to continue to set lofty goals. I have always felt that it is better to aim for the stars and drag your feet in the treetops than to aim for the treetops and drag your feet in the mud.<br><br>When it came time for me to select a university, my first choice was BYU here in Provo; however, I did not qualify. Not academically, because I had worked through high school more than I had studied, nor financially, because I could not afford to live away from home. Hence the option I chose was to attend the University of Utah, where I could live at home, work locally, and attend school full-time. Sometimes we need to be willing to adjust our goals and modify our plans while never losing sight of the desired end result.<br><br>The most important event that happened during my university days was meeting my dear sweetheart, Melanie Twitchell. We dated and then were married in the Salt Lake Temple, sealed there for time and all eternity. That was a goal we both set in our growing-up years.<br><br>We chose to start our family shortly after we were married, having confidence that we would be blessed in our temporal matters if we put the Lord first. I can highly recommend this plan to you here today. Also in those beginning years of marriage I served as president of my elders quorum, worked mostly full-time, and continued with my goal to get a degree in business and marketing. Honestly, life could not have been more challenging or full than it was in those college years.<br><br>Another life-changing opportunity occurred while I was attending school. I met Jon Huntsman, who would be my future employer and partner. He was my high council advisor while I was serving as elders quorum president.<br><br>After a year or so of knowing the Huntsmans, I was surprised one day when Jon invited me into his business office. I was a beginning senior at the university and just one year away from that long-sought-after degree in business. In that meeting Jon invited me to join his company in marketing and sales. I was overwhelmingly honored, and I felt that the deep and sincere prayer Sister Rasband and I had of finding meaningful employment was being answered.<br><br>Jon said to me he was not interested in me because of my academic credentials. (I don't think he ever knew my grade point average. That was a good thing!) He told me he was interested because he felt significant character traits he saw exemplified in my life would work well in his business--character traits such as a strong work ethic and the ability to balance all the life-challenging priorities we were faced with at that time.<br><br>I told Jon that I would be thrilled to join his company in the spring after graduation. I explained to him my long-sought-after quest for a college degree and how important it was to my family and me. Jon, in his very kind yet pointed way, explained that he needed me now. The next week he would be in Troy, Ohio, at one of his packaging plants to negotiate with a major customer. He told me if I wanted the job, I needed to be there to become their account manager. That was it--next week in Troy, Ohio, or no job offer at all!<br><br>That evening we prayed earnestly and sought the counsel of close loved ones and friends. The most important advice to me was from my sweet wife, Melanie. I remember her saying, "Isn't this what people go to college for, to find an opportunity like this one?" What a partner, what a help-mate! We are a team, and that night was a good example of the full partnership that we have in our marriage. I sincerely recommend that to each of you. Whether you are currently married or awaiting marriage, have it be a full and complete partnership. The Spirit confirmed our decision, and I took the job in Ohio.<br><br>That week I walked off the campus of the University of Utah just two semesters short of receiving my degree. Eleven years later I was humbled when Jon Huntsman appointed me as the president of his global corporation with thousands of employees and billions in revenues. This should suggest that there is a masterpiece within each one of us, and when spiritually nurtured, carefully mentored, and loyally engaged in building up our families and the Lord's kingdom, all things are possible.<br><br>Perhaps now you can understand why today is such a special, memorable day for me. Since those early feelings of wishing I could attend BYU to this very day--now standing here at commencement--it is a dream come true!<br><br>Commencement also reminds me of the account in Matthew 14 when Christ had spent the afternoon teaching a great multitude and feeding them with five loaves and two fishes. Many of you will appreciate how those fishes and loaves multiplied, as have your meager supplies through your years of college. Following the afternoon of this great miracle, the disciples boarded a boat to cross the Sea of Galilee while Jesus "went up into a mountain apart to pray" (verse 23). We read in Matthew: "The ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary" (verse 24).<br><br>Consider this boat as your launch into a new life--be it a profession, further study, or raising a family. You will still be juggling tasks and responsibilities. You learned how here; you will need those skills for the rest of your life. The way ahead will not be smooth or without incident. In the coming stages of your life you will feel the boat rocking under you, no matter your preparation or your sheer goodness. Recognize the turbulence for what it is. The Lord allows us challenges that at times will feel like tsunamis to make us strong and effective in His service and to help us always turn to Him.<br><br>Continuing in Matthew:<br><br><i>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</i><br><br><i>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</i><br><br><i>But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</i><br><br><i>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</i><br><br><i>And</i>[Jesus]<i>said, Come.</i>[Matthew 14:25–29]<br><br>I love that image. Peter, the devoted disciple, needed only that call to "come" and he was over the side of the boat and walking toward Jesus. He did not hesitate or stop to gauge the risks.<br><br>That's where you are. You are ready to respond to the Lord's call: "Come." Commencement is just that. You are being called to go out into the world as representatives of Jesus Christ with all you have been taught and know to be true.<br><br>Matthew continues: "And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus" (verse 29). Think of it: "He walked on the water." This was unfamiliar territory to this fisherman. You too are poised for walking that unfamiliar ground. You have prepared your minds and have learned to take responsibility; you have been schooled in more than mortal knowledge. The Spirit abounds on this campus because you, disciples of Jesus Christ, have been worthy of that blessing; you will take that Spirit with you into the world.<br><br>"But when [Peter] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me" (verse 30). What a message! Peter, by the power of God--there is no other way he could do it--walked on water. On that short journey he looked down and saw the waves churning and felt the wind swirling, and he faltered. He began to sink. He immediately turned to the source of all power, to his beloved Master, to call for His help.<br><br>"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him" (verse 31). That hand, brothers and sisters, is always there for you; it has been there for me. Jesus Christ will be your greatest ally and mentor in your years ahead. He will be, as we read in the scriptures, "on your right hand and on your left" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88) if you live close to Him, His words, and His ways.<br><br>Jobs, assignments, contentions, and moves from here to there will lap at your feet to distract you and consume you. It is the way of mortality. Be wise. Know that you can draw upon the power of God to always have His Spirit with you on this journey. "Come," He will say to you with an outstretched hand. That doesn't mean He will change the circumstances; you may still be out on the swirling water, but His Atonement will lift you to higher ground.<br><br>What He asks is that your daily life reflect your testimony "that He lives" (D&amp;amp;C 76:22). Take counsel from the Lord's words at the beginning of this dispensation:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 68:6]<br><br>You can do that--and you must do that. It is for this very purpose that you leave here today prepared with an education and armed in the truths of the gospel. Few other graduates in mortar-boards with diplomas in hand have such a charge. You have a unique assignment in the Lord's kingdom to go "about doing good" (Acts 10:38) no matter what else you are doing.<br><br>You will encounter many opportunities to "lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better" (D&amp;amp;C 25:10). Know this: your life on earth will not be measured by what you do for a profession or what your address is or what callings you hold. What will be recorded in the Lamb's book of life is how you live your covenants--how you prepare yourself to meet God.<br><br>Don't wait to make enough money so you can afford to serve the Lord. Don't put your work in front of your parenting. Don't make it a habit to reach out to steady the ark in the Lord's kingdom. Don't feel entitled to more than your share of the Lord's blessings, and don't boast about them as if they were a measure of your own greatness. Be humble, kind, and forgiving. Be generous. Be gentle and long-suffering--and, most of all, be honest. We need you out there holding fast and helping others to do the same.<br><br>Being an example of what is right requires fortitude, hard work, earnest desire, and energy. It means living the laws of God. You will have remarkable influence over those with whom you work, serve, and live--your families, neighbors, ward members, work associates, and even the store clerk.<br><br>It may have been acceptable for the disciples to sit in the boat and wait until Jesus Christ walked to the side. However, Peter knew when he heard "come" that his integrity to the cause of Christ required he do just that.<br><br>The Lord will call you to places and positions you would have never expected. I view my job opportunity with Jon Huntsman to have been just that. President Thomas S. Monson has said, "When God speaks and a man obeys, man will always be right" ("The Call of Duty,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, 37).<br><br>Study the scriptures to know the word of God, be prayerful, be found standing in holy places--the temple in particular--and "be strong and of good courage" (1 Chronicles 28:20) even when the waves come and the dam breaks.<br><br>The next stages of your life can be richly rewarding. You can at the end of the day give an accounting to the Lord that has little to do with what happened and much to do with how you were sustained by the power of God. I have felt that influence in my home, in my assignments, and in the lives of my wife, children, and grandchildren. It is a sweet peace to know the Lord is with you and that you are His and that when His hand reaches out to you the grip is familiar and the message is clear: "Come unto me" (Matthew 11:28).<br><br>May the Lord bless each one of you, we--your fellow colleagues, brethren, and sisters--pray. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ronald A.

<h1> to Learn - to August 2013 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am always grateful to have this opportunity to reflect with you graduates, faculty, family, and friends on what it is that we are really celebrating in this commencement today. I'm guessing that if we were to survey this large crowd in the Marriott Center, we would be exposed to several responses. Most would be legitimate and understandable, some might be more personal and even unusual, and some might just reflect the wonderment that this phase of life is finally over.<br><br>In a<i>Deseret News</i>editorial on June 2 of this year, it was reported that comedian commentator Stephen Colbert, who gave this year's commencement address at the University of Virginia, asked the graduates, "Why are you leaving? This could be the most spectacular place you have ever lived" ("In Our Opinion: Learning for a Lifetime"). I suppose that we could ask the same of new BYU graduates, recognizing that some of you have been here for a very long time.<br><br>The purposes and promises of BYU are unique and special and deserve never to be forgotten. Our wonderful physical environment contributes to this, but there is so much more. You are part of an emerging miracle in higher education foreseen by prophets of an earlier generation and sustained and guided by our current apostles and prophets. You are evidence that what they dreamed about is realistic, with even more to come. Never forget that promises have been made and promises are yet to be kept by all who have had the blessing of being at Brigham Young University.<br><br>Most of you of necessity will be leaving, but we hope and expect none of you will ever forget what has happened to you at BYU. We hope you will always feel welcome to return and continue to help make it be the university of which we can be most proud and for which we are most grateful.<br><br>Your diplomas and credentials will attest that, to the best of our ability to judge and measure, you have learned a great deal; have mastered skills, approaches, and disciplines; and are prepared to make your significant contributions to your families, communities, church, and nation. What is the most valuable thing you have learned? Again, I believe that there would be a wide variety of responses to that question.<br><br>With the perspective of having lived a few more years than most of you, let me share what I think may be most valuable to you. Of course the Aims of a BYU Education are all vital and are not easily simplified. We expect that you have been spiritually strengthened and intellectually enlarged and have experienced enhancement of your already strong character. All of this has been designed to lead and assist you in an ever-ongoing adventure of lifelong learning and service.<br><br>In brief, then, perhaps what is most valuable to you is the increased capacity you have developed, and hopefully will continue to develop, to effectively keep on learning throughout your lifetime and beyond in all spheres of the BYU Mission and Aims. If you will forgive a personal example, let me try to illustrate why this is of more than just theoretical importance.<br><br>Some of you know that my academic discipline is in the field of medicine. When I graduated from medical school and passed through a few demanding years of internship, residency, and postdoctoral fellowship training, I finally felt as a newly minted and licensed physician and medical school faculty member that I was as current in my narrow field of specialty as could be expected. Now, some forty-plus years later, much of what I then learned is no longer applicable or relevant, and very much more is known than I could have then imagined. I feel a little like the sentiments expressed by Thurman Arnold, who said, "The principles of Washington's farewell address are still sources of wisdom when cures for social ills are sought. The methods of Washington's physician, however, are no longer studied" (<i>The Symbols of Government</i>[New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1962], 1).<br><br>Now, to be clear, I never used leeches to drain the blood from my ill patients or prescribed any of the tonics or unproven therapies of the eighteenth century, but I also was not trained in many of the miracles of 21st-century medicine. What was true in my particular area of interest was that we had merely a handful of drugs and modalities to diagnose and treat the problems that I had an interest in during the 1970s. Today's physicians now have many dozens of new and improved tools and approaches to enhance and preserve the lives of the afflicted. Transplanted and artificial organs were still something largely experimental in my early days of medical practice, teaching, and research, as were artificial joint replacements, genetic testing for multiple diseases, anticholesterol drugs--and the list goes on and on.<br><br>My central point in this example--which I believe generalizes to virtually every discipline and area of scientific and academic inquiry--is that for you to remain as relevant at the end of your career as you are now or when you finally finish your formal academic preparations, you will be required to know how to keep on learning and hopefully contribute to the continued learning of others.<br><br>Happily, we are sustained in all of this not only by experience and observation but also by our theology and understanding of the plan of salvation, in which continued learning and the persistent pursuit of new knowledge and understanding are part of the reason for our being. We know that we are instructed to learn "line upon line" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12) and that God has placed no limits on the amount of time for us to accomplish all that we can.<br><br>Congratulations again on your achievements and particularly on the potential you have demonstrated for not only continued personal growth and development but also for substantive service to all you encounter. You leave with our confidence and blessings as you go forth to serve. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>nding Success - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, members of the board of trustees, administrators, faculty, guests, and especially graduates, we've made it! We're graduating from Brigham Young University, and today we are here to celebrate our success.<br><br>In fact, one of the most important lessons I've learned in my time at BYU is to view success differently. I've learned that life demands high effort from everyone all the time but does so in two general forms, either of which can result in success.<br><br>The first form I'm going to call "climbing." This describes times in life in which one must devote high effort to developing talents, maximizing opportunities, and realizing potential. Climbing is characterized by persistence and self-motivation and generally results in achievements that our society applauds and actively tracks--résumé items, of which receiving a college education is but one example. Most often when we imagine a "successful" person, we think of someone who has climbed.<br><br>I have come to better understand another form of success. Where<i>success</i>means the favorable ending of a situation requiring effort, I contest that in many cases ­enduring or merely surviving is succeeding. With permission, I want to share the story of one of my good friends. For some time now I have watched this friend struggle with major organ failure. Every semester she registers for classes, becomes severely ill, and is forced to withdraw. She has waited and waited on a transplant list. This year she received a transplant and returned ready to dive into classes at last. Then complications arose, and she learned of a mistake in how the new organ was attached. Now she is waiting on the transplant list again.<br><br>My friend is not here graduating with us today. After four years of college, her résumé is not much more bulked and polished than when we arrived, so it may seem that success is postponed for her. I have more than once heard her say disappointedly how very long it will take her to graduate. Yet the way she continues to face it all with dignity is, for now, a favorable ending, making my friend one of the first people I and others who know her would consider successful.<br><br>On a separate occasion I was asked to judge scholarship applications for at-risk students graduating from alternative high schools. I was devastated to find that every applicant had more than one looming challenge that I would consider a substantial academic setback: homelessness, teen parenthood, legal trouble, terminally ill parents, learning disabilities, depression, and other serious socioeconomic hurdles. It weighed on me how badly each needed a scholarship--as much for a morale boost and vote of confidence as for financial means. In their essays each conveyed an apologetic tone for how little they had accomplished academically. Though they were remedial students, I felt they underestimated how commendable their efforts were, and I was saddened that their already heavy burdens were exacerbated by a sense of low worth.<br><br>I would hardly be saying anything new by asserting that continued effort and overcoming barriers qualifies as success. But actually what I've realized is that enduring is harder than climbing--besides being much less commonly rewarded or even acknowledged. So often those enduring the most feel they are accomplishing nothing. Among my own experiences as a student, the most exacting have been those that involve enduring, and were I given the choice, I would always prefer to climb. That is why I am most grateful to be graduating from BYU today.<br><br>To our administrators, professors, family members, and other supporters present, I know I speak for the whole class when I say that we are grateful to you for organization, instruction, financial and emotional support, job opportunities, and mentoring. We recognize that we've made it here today riding on the contributions of so many others besides ourselves. And of course we are grateful to God. We have all been blessed with a period of climbing with four or more years free enough of trouble to allow us to graduate. We have spent these years preparing to contribute to a society in which one in five children lacks consistent access to food,<sup>1</sup>one in twelve has been sexually abused,<sup>2</sup>and roughly two in three elementary school classes include a student with a parent in prison.<sup>3</sup>In so many cases the adults who permit and perpetuate these circumstances are those who made up the similar statistics a generation ago. Against such a sobering background we also realize that where "much is given much is required."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Today as we finalize our commitment to "go forth to serve," I suggest that to be effective we must develop eyes to see all flavors of human achievement and lend support, approval, and encouragement to the invisible crusades. It will be repeatedly necessary that we wade in to help, unflinchingly and nonjudgmentally. Standing as we do and will along the path to healing in Christ's Church, it is crucial that association with us be emotionally safe for anyone hurt and discouraged. And when we ourselves become discouraged, we can look to the Savior, who said, "I was an hungred, . . . naked, . . . sick . . . : I was in prison, and ye came unto me."<sup>5</sup><br><br>That the world will be a little better for the Class of 2013 is my prayer.

<h1>ying the Foundation of a Great Work&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As BYU Alumni president, I have been able to attend several commencement exercises, and I have noticed that graduates often experience a range of emotions. Perhaps you feel like this student who, some years ago, sent a letter to then President Jeffrey R. Holland stating:<br><br><i>Dear President Holland:</i><br><br><i>I am completing my undergraduate experience at BYU this month and will be graduating in our upcoming commencement service. My parents are relieved, my professors are surprised, and I am holding my breath. Things could go wrong, you know, even at this late date.</i>[Jeffrey R. and Patricia T. Holland, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-and-patricia-t-holland_however-long-hard-road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">However Long and Hard the Road</a>," BYU devotional address, 18 January 1983]<br><br>At this point in time I think you can all exhale. You made it!<br><br>It is with great pleasure that I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000. You will have many ­opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>So now let me tell you how the rest of this goes today: I usually congratulate you for your achievement and challenge you to stay connected with the university. And you should stay connected with the university. Now you can move on to life's next objective: posting pictures of yourself in cap and gown on social media and checking how many "likes," "favorites," and "retweets" you will receive today.<br><br>Receiving a degree from Brigham Young University is really a tremendous accomplishment. In the words of Sir Winston Churchill, it is a victory accomplished with much "blood, toil, tears and sweat" (first statement as prime minister, House of Commons, 13 May 1940).<br><br>But today my message is to express our gratitude to all of you. You matter. You are of great value to this university and an asset to this university. We are thankful to have you here. We realize that, just as for a highly recruited athlete, the superior academic standards required for admission mean that you had a choice of where you could pursue your education. We are glad you chose BYU.<br><br>Thank you for attending this tremendous university and for helping us achieve the great reputation that we enjoy.<br><br>In 2012 we ranked No. 1 nationally for our accounting program and in the top five for our master's of accountancy program, for our public relations program, and for our graduate and undergraduate entrepreneurship. We also ranked as the Best Value Law School. We were No. 10 for graduates who go on to receive doctorates, and we ranked impressively in many other categories.<br><br>Thank you for not only choosing BYU because of its academic standards but also for choosing BYU because of its commitment to providing an atmosphere that is consistent with the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>You just don't achieve sixteen straight years of receiving the No. 1 Stone-Cold Sober Campus Award without some real effort.<br><br>The recent edition of<i>BYU Magazine</i>highlights a few of the other accolades that our students have received this year. BYU students have won awards in mechanical engineering, musical performance, animation, landscaping, entrepreneurship, physical education, and mathematic competitions, to name just a few.<br><br>Coming from an alumnus who would have had a hard time getting admitted to this university now with the grades he had then, I personally thank you for increasing the value of my BYU degree.<br><br>While we appreciate the awards BYU receives, most of the student success stories are not nationally recognized. We hope you all have had experiences here that have enriched your lives.<br><br>One of our graduates today, Micah McArthur Taylor, was able to travel to China with the Contemporary Dance Theatre group. While in China her dance group was able to perform for church and civic groups. Micah found that despite the language barrier, she could communicate spirit-to-spirit through dance. She gained a new appreciation for what it means to be part of this world family and a confirmation that we are all children of our Heavenly Father. Thank you, Micah, for helping BYU touch the lives of those you worked with in China.<br><br>Another graduate, Tim Menditto, has been one of our valuable student employees. His main assignment has been to assist in hosting duties on our beautiful campus. His profound interest in cultures, languages, and service has helped him connect with the general public as well as with the various dignitaries and special guests who visit BYU. His natural inquisitiveness and cooperative attitude keep him well educated and represent us positively. Thank you, Tim, for going the extra mile while hosting visitors to this campus.<br><br>I am confident you will all use your individual talents to "go forth to serve" and will represent us well.<br><br>D&amp;amp;C 64:33 states:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i><br><br>During your time here you have laid strong foundations. That "great work" is your future and the fulfillment of your dreams.<br><br>When you left your families to come here, BYU became a new home for you. As BYU alumni, this campus and these people will always be your family. Please keep the Spirit of the Y alive wherever you go, and may Heavenly Father bless you in the great work that is your bright future.<br><br>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Michael O'Connor was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 15 August 2013.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>quot;Let Us Think Straight&quot; - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I hope you are having a wonderful time while here at BYU during Campus Education Week. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has given to us. There is so much information that I always feel we need to be cautious and wise to ever keep uppermost in our minds the simple doctrine and gospel of Christ. Simply stated, it is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of sin, baptism by immersion for the remission of sin, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.<br><br>Sister Ballard and I returned a few days ago from England, where we had the privilege, along with several of the Brethren and their wives, to watch the first-ever presentation of the British Pageant. Some 200 cast members, and several hundred other volunteer members, told the story in song, dance, and the spoken word about the arrival of Elders Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Willard Richards, Joseph Fielding, and a few others who came to establish The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in England.<br><br>As I watched that story unfold, it brought great memories flooding back to my mind of my experience sixty-five years ago arriving in England to serve a full-time mission as a young man. And as the story progressed, I was deeply touched by the overwhelming contribution converts in the British Isles, and, of course, some from Scandinavia, made in building up and strengthening The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1837 and even on through to today. These fearless early missionaries, bearers of the priesthood and the message of the Restoration, touched hundreds and later thousands of lives through their testimonies, priesthood blessings, and love for the people of Great Britain. They reaped a great harvest of wonderful converts.<br><br>As I watched the pageant, I thought to myself, "How did they do this?" The early Saints did not have any proselytizing systems. They did not have<i>Preach My Gospel.</i>They did not have a Missionary Training Center. They did not have easy ways of transportation. But what they did have was an abiding, deep testimony that Joseph Smith knelt in the presence of the Father and the Son as They appeared to him in 1820 and opened the way of the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Father and the Son gave him the principles of the doctrine of Christ that I have previously mentioned.<br><br>As I pondered the miracle of the mission to Great Britain, it seemed to me that the simple gospel truths, powerfully explained by those great apostles of yesteryear, just penetrated the hearts of the people. I was also deeply impressed--in fact, so much so that I changed what I had in mind to share with you today because of the impressions that came to me about the power and the importance of the faith and testimony of the dear women and even the children who joined the Church during that formative era. As I watched and remembered, it was overwhelming. They withstood the challenges of the journey to Zion because of their faith, their own study and knowledge of the Book of Mormon, and their unwavering acceptance of Joseph Smith as the prophet of this dispensation. The women of the British Isles who made their way here--many arriving without their companion and some of their children whom they buried along the way--were in many ways the heart of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in those early days.<br><br>The same is true now. In so many ways women are the heart of the Church. So today, with the help of the Lord, I would like to pay tribute to the faithful women and young women of the Church today. To you dear sisters, wherever you live in the world and whether you hear this address or read it, please know of the great affection and trust that the First Presidency and the Twelve have in you.<br><br>In 1948, when I arrived in England, it was after World War II, and many of the little branches that grew into wards and stakes were really held together by the faith--the simple faith--and trust in our Heavenly Father and His plan of those sisters who remained behind while their husbands and sons went off to fight in World War II. Had it not been for the sisters and their faith and their strength during those difficult days, we would have had to start our work from scratch in several of the branches where I served.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I pray that the Lord will bless me that I may follow the counsel of a small plaque in my office that reads, "Above all else, brethren, let us think straight." These were the last words spoken in mortality by my grandfather, Elder Melvin J. Ballard, who was in the hospital suffering end-stage leukemia in 1939.<br><br>My father, who was sitting at Grandfather's bedside, told me that Grandfather pushed himself up in bed, looked around his hospital room as though he were addressing a congregation or a group, and said clearly, "And above all else, brethren, let us think straight." I don't go into my office any day of the week that I don't see those words.<br><br>"Thinking straight" for all of us has always been important, but never more so than today.<br><br>From the beginning of time there have been articulate men and women who have had unusual powers of persuasion. Those with gifts of communication have always had great influence, but the influence of persuasive communicators has never been greater than it is today. Because of the Internet, and particularly the popularity and proliferation of social media--Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and heaven only knows what else has become popular that I'm not aware of yet--anyone can talk to anyone about anything. Today anyone who is clever, articulate, and glib can find an audience and develop a following. Unfortunately, not everyone who has cultivated the ability to communicate uses their powers of expression to spread or teach truth. And not everyone has the help of the Holy Ghost to think straight.<br><br>In what I say this morning please keep in mind and think straight about the basic doctrines of Christ that include the love our Father in Heaven has for His daughters who are precious and essential to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I encourage you brethren to listen carefully as well as the sisters because I believe there are some truths that both women and men need to understand about the essential role women have in strengthening and building up the kingdom of God on the earth.<br><br>You have come to Campus Education Week to learn new things and to take refresher courses on things you may have forgotten or not focused on for a while. So let me begin with a refresher course about what we are doing here--and I don't mean what we are doing here at BYU today. I'm referring to what we are doing here on earth.<br><br>We are beloved spirit sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. We lived with Him in the premortal realms. In order to fulfill the mission of bringing "to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39), Heavenly Father created a plan designed to help His children achieve their ultimate potential. Our Father's plan called for man to fall and to be separated from Him for a time by being born into mortality, gaining a body, and entering a period of testing and probation. His plan provided for a Savior to redeem mankind from the Fall. The Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ provides the way through gospel ordinances and sacred covenants to return to the presence of God. Because we would live in a mortal environment filled with danger and distractions, Heavenly Father and His Son knew we would need access to power greater than our own. They knew we would need access to Their power. The gospel and doctrine of Christ give all who will accept it power to achieve eternal life and power to find joy in the journey.<br><br>There are those who question the place of women in God's plan and in the Church. I've been interviewed enough by national and international media to tell you that most journalists with whom I have dealt have had preconceived notions about this topic. Through the years many have asked questions implying that women are second-class citizens in the Church. Brothers and sisters, nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>Let me suggest five key points for you to ponder and think straight about regarding this important topic.<br><h2><strong>Number 1</strong></h2><br>I repeat: Our Heavenly Father created both women and men, who are His spirit daughters and sons. This means that gender is eternal. He has a plan designed to help all who choose to follow Him and His Son Jesus Christ achieve their destiny as heirs of eternal life.<br><br>Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ are perfect. They are omniscient and understand all things. Further, Their hopes for us are perfect. Their work and Their glory is to see Their children exalted--to bring about the immortality and eternal life of mankind.<br><br>Surely if our eventual exaltation is Their essential goal and purpose, and if They are omniscient and perfect as we know They are, then They understand best how to prepare, teach, and lead us so that we have the greatest chance to qualify for exaltation. There was an old-time television program called<i>Father Knows Best,</i>in which the father in the family was depicted as having all the answers. Well, we all know that no father on this earth is infallible. But there is one father, our Father in Heaven, who knows all, foresees all, and understands all. His comprehension, His wisdom, and His love for us are perfect. Surely we must agree that our Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ know best which opportunities the sons and daughters of God need to best prepare the human family for eternal life.<br><br>Most everyone has family or friends who have been caught up in various troubling contemporary social issues. Arguing about the issues generally does not bring any resolution and, in fact, can create contention. There are some questions about the Church's position on sensitive issues that are hard to answer to anyone's satisfaction. However, when we seek the Lord in prayer about how to feel and what to do in these situations, the impression comes: "Do you believe in Jesus Christ and do you follow Him and the Father?" I believe most everyone in the Church at one time or another will wonder if they can do all they are asked to do. But if we really believe in the Lord, the reassurance comes: "I believe Jesus Christ, and I'm willing to do whatever He needs me to do." So we move forward. How powerful are the words "I believe Jesus Christ"!<br><br>When all is said and done, each of us has the privilege of choosing whether or not we will believe that God is our Father, that Jesus is the Christ, and that They have a plan designed to help us return home to Them. This, of course, requires faith, which is why faith is the first principle of the gospel. Our testimonies and our peace of mind and our well-being begin with the willingness to believe that our Father in Heaven does indeed know best.<br><h2><strong>Number 2</strong></h2><br>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's Church, and His Church is governed by and through priesthood authority and priesthood keys.<br><br><i>Priesthood keys are the authority God has given to priesthood leaders to direct, control, and govern the use of His priesthood on earth. The exercise of priesthood authority is governed by those who hold its keys (see D&amp;amp;C 65:2; 81:2; 124:123). Those who hold priesthood keys have the right to preside over and direct the Church within a jurisdiction.</i>["Priesthood Keys,"<i>Handbook 2: Administering the Church</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2010), 2.1.1 (p. 8)]<br><br>Those who have priesthood keys--whether that be a deacon who has keys for his quorum or a bishop who has keys for his ward or a stake president who has keys for his stake or the president of the Church who holds all priesthood keys--literally make it possible for all who serve or labor faithfully under their direction to exercise priesthood authority and have access to priesthood power.<br><br>All men and all women serve under the direction of those who have keys. This is how the Lord governs His Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "The Priesthood is an everlasting principle, and existed with God from eternity, and will to eternity, without beginning of days or end of years" (<i>HC</i>3:386; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2007], 104).<br><br>President David O. McKay further explained:<br><br><i>Priesthood is inherent in the Godhead. It is authority and power which has its source only in the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ. . . .</i><br><br><i>In seeking the source of the priesthood, . . . we can conceive of no condition beyond God himself. In him it centers. From him it must emanate. Priesthood, being thus inherent in the Father, it follows that he alone can give it to another.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1965, 103; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: David O. McKay</i>(2003), 115]<br><br>Let me repeat something I stated in the April 2013 general conference:<br><br><i>In our Heavenly Father's great priesthood-endowed plan, men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood, but they are not the priesthood. Men and women have different but equally valued roles. Just as a woman cannot conceive a child without a man, so a man cannot fully exercise the power of the priesthood to establish an eternal family without a woman. . . . In the eternal perspective, both the procreative power and the priesthood power are shared by husband and wife.</i>["This Is My Work and Glory,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2013, 19]<br><br>Why are men ordained to priesthood offices and not women? President Gordon B. Hinckley explained that it was the Lord, not man, "who designated that men in His Church should hold the priesthood" and that it was also the Lord who endowed women with "capabilities to round out this great and marvelous organization, which is the Church and kingdom of God" ("Women of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, 70). When all is said and done, the Lord has not revealed why He has organized His Church as He has.<br><br>When thinking about those things we do not fully understand, I am reminded of these words by my deceased friend and Apostle, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who said, "What we already know about God teaches us to trust him for what we do not know fully" (<i>Deposition of a Disciple</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976], 56).<br><br>And Elder Jeffrey R. Holland stated in this last April general conference, "In this Church, what we know will always trump what we do not know" ("Lord, I Believe,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2013, 94).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this matter, like many others, comes down to our faith. Do we believe that this is the Lord's Church? Do we believe that He has organized it according to His purposes and wisdom? Do we believe that His wisdom far exceeds ours? Do we believe that He has organized His Church in a manner that would be the greatest possible blessing to<i>all</i>of His children, both His sons and His daughters?<br><br>I know these things are true and testify that they are true. I testify that this is the Lord's Church. Women are integral to the governance and work of the Church through service as leaders in Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary; through their service as teachers, full-time missionaries, and temple ordinance workers; and in the home, where the most important teaching in the Church occurs.<br><br>Let us not forget that approximately one-half of all of the teaching that takes place in the Church is done by sisters. Much of the leadership provided is from our sisters. Many service opportunities and activities are planned and directed by women. The counsel and other participation of women in ward and stake councils and in general councils at Church headquarters provide needed insight, wisdom, and balance.<br><br>Elder Quentin L. Cook told about a life-changing role a stake Relief Society president had in Tonga. During a stake conference held while Elder Cook was there, the names of sixty-three prospective elders were sustained for ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood. When Elder Cook asked how this "miracle" had been accomplished, the stake president told him that in a stake council meeting, the stake Relief Society president spoke of many men in their late twenties and early thirties who had not served missions and who were in various stages of activity. She suggested that the council focus on priesthood ordinations and temple ordinances for them as well as for their wives--some of whom were less active or not members.<br><br>"As she spoke, the Spirit confirmed to the [stake] president that what she was suggesting was true," Elder Cook related.<br><br><i>It was decided that the men of the priesthood and the women of the Relief Society would reach out to rescue these men and their wives. . . . Those involved in the rescue focused primarily on preparing them for the priesthood, eternal marriage, and the saving ordinances of the temple. During the next two years, almost all of the 63 men who had been sustained to the Melchizedek Priesthood at the conference I attended were endowed in the temple and had their spouses sealed to them. This account is but one example of how critical our sisters are in the work of salvation.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/lds-women-are-incredible?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDS Women Are Incredible</a>!"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2011, 20–21]<br><br>For more than twenty years I have been teaching the importance of councils, including the vital participation of sister leaders, and the work of councils is emphasized in the current Church handbooks. As I say these things, however, I acknowledge that there are some men, including some priesthood leaders, who have not yet seen the light and who still do not include our sister leaders in full partnership in ward and stake councils. I also acknowledge that there are some men who oppress women and in some rare circumstances are guilty of abusing women. This is abhorrent in the eyes of God. I feel certain that men who in any way demean women will answer to God for their actions. And let me add that any priesthood leader who does not involve his sister leaders with full respect and inclusion is not honoring and magnifying the keys he has been given. His power and influence will be diminished until he learns the ways of the Lord.<br><br>Now, sisters, in speaking this frankly with men, may I also exercise a moment of candor with you. While your input is significant and welcomed in effective councils, you need to be careful not to assume a role that is not yours. Ward and stake councils that are the most successful are those in which priesthood leaders trust their sister leaders and encourage them to contribute to the discussions and in which sister leaders fully respect and sustain the decisions of the council made under the direction of priesthood leaders who hold keys. Families are helped and individuals are activated through council meetings in which this partnership exists and in which the focus is on people. Units in the Church are strengthened by members who love and desire to help one another as they serve the Lord.<br><br>The proclamation on the family teaches foundational truths about the separate roles of men and women, particularly as they relate to their positions as husbands and wives:<br><br><i>By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>It takes a man and a woman to create a new life. And it takes both men who respect women and the distinctive spiritual gifts they have and women who respect the priesthood keys held by men to invite the full blessings of heaven in any endeavor in the Church.<br><h2><strong>Number 3</strong></h2><br>Men and women are equal in God's eyes and in the eyes of the Church, but equal does not mean, brothers and sisters, that they are the same. The responsibilities and divine gifts of men and women differ in their nature but not in their importance or influence. Our Church doctrine places women equal to and yet different from men. God does not regard either gender as better or more important than the other. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared to you women that "our Eternal Father . . . never intended that you should be less than the crowning glory of His creations" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1995/10/stand-strong-against-the-wiles-of-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand Strong Against the Wiles of the World</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 98).<br><br>I mention this simply because there are those at times who become confused and fail to think straight when comparing the assignments of men to those of women and the assignments of women to those of men.<br><br>I have been surrounded by women my entire life. I have three sisters. I was the only boy. I have five daughters, twenty-four granddaughters, and nineteen great-granddaughters. And, of course, I have been blessed through sixty-two years of marriage to my wife, Barbara. I learned long ago to listen to her. I learned that when she said she'd been thinking about something or had strong feelings about a matter pertaining to the family, I had better pay attention, because in nearly every case she had been inspired. I know firsthand how young adult sisters and young mothers sometimes feel and sometimes question their self-worth and their ability to contribute. But I am a witness that when one's thoughts turn toward the Savior, a strength and conviction that Heavenly Father and the Lord understand will bless them.<br><br>Women come to earth with unique spiritual gifts and propensities. This is particularly true when it comes to children and families and also to the well-being and nurturing of others in the Church as well as in the family.<br><br>Men and women have different gifts, different strengths, and different points of view and inclinations. That is one of the fundamental reasons why we need each other. It takes a man and a woman to create a family, and it takes men and women to carry out the work of the Lord in the Church. A husband and wife righteously working together complete each other. Let us be careful that we do not attempt to tamper with our Heavenly Father's plan and purposes in our lives.<br><h2><strong>Number 4</strong></h2><br>When men and women go to the temple, they are both endowed with the same power, which by definition is priesthood power. While the authority of the priesthood is directed through priesthood keys, and priesthood keys are held only by worthy men, access to the power and the blessings of the priesthood is available to all of God's children.<br><br>As President Joseph Fielding Smith explained:<br><br><i>The blessings of the priesthood are not confined to men alone. These blessings are also poured out upon . . . all the faithful women of the Church. . . . The Lord offers to his daughters every spiritual gift and blessing that can be obtained by his sons.</i>["Magnifying Our Callings in the Priesthood,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>June 1970, 66]<br><br>Those who have entered the waters of baptism and subsequently received their endowment in the house of the Lord are eligible for rich and wonderful blessings. The endowment is literally a gift of power. All who enter the house of the Lord officiate in the ordinances of the priesthood. This applies to men and women alike.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven is generous with His power. All men and all women have access to this power for help in our own lives. All who have made sacred covenants with the Lord and who honor those covenants are eligible to receive personal revelation, to be blessed by the ministering of angels, to commune with God, to receive the fulness of the gospel, and, ultimately, to become heirs alongside Jesus Christ of all our Father has.<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe explained that<br><br><i>the Priesthood is for the benefit of all members of the Church. Men have no greater claim than women upon the blessings that issue from the Priesthood and accompany its possession.</i><br><br><i>Woman does not hold the Priesthood, but she is a partaker of the blessings of the Priesthood.</i>[<i>Priesthood and Church Government</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1939), 83]<br><br>And Elder James E. Talmage taught:<br><br><i>It is not given to woman to exercise the authority of the Priesthood independently; nevertheless, . . . woman shares with man the blessings of the Priesthood. . . . In the glorified state of the blessed hereafter, husband and wife will administer in their respective stations, seeing and understanding alike, and co-operating to the full in the government of their family kingdom. . . . Then shall woman reign by Divine right, a queen in the resplendent realm of her glorified state, even as exalted man shall stand, priest and king unto the Most High God. Mortal eye cannot see nor mind comprehend the beauty, glory, and majesty of a righteous woman made perfect in the celestial kingdom of God.</i>["The Eternity of Sex,"<i>Young Woman's Journal,</i>October 1914, 602–3]<br><h2><strong>Number 5</strong></h2><br>We need now for you women of the Church to know the doctrine of Christ and to bear testimony of the Restoration in every way that you can. Never has there been a more complex time in the history of the earth. Satan and his minions have been perfecting the weapons in their arsenal for millennia, and they are experienced at destroying faith and trust in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ among the human family.<br><br>All of us--men, women, young adults, youth, and boys and girls--have the Lord and His Church to defend, to protect, and to spread throughout the earth. We need more of the distinctive, influential voices and faith of women. We need you to learn the doctrine and to understand what we believe so that you can bear your testimonies about the truth of all things--whether those testimonies be given around a campfire at girls' camp, in a testimony meeting, in a blog, or on Facebook. Only you can show the world what women of God who have made covenants look like and believe.<br><br>None of us can afford to stand by and watch the purposes of God be diminished and pushed aside. I invite particularly you sisters here and throughout the Church to seek the guidance of heaven in knowing what you can do to let your voice of faith and testimony be heard. The Brethren of the General Authorities and the sisters who are general officers cannot do it alone. The full-time missionaries cannot do it alone. Priesthood leaders and auxiliary leaders cannot do it alone. We must all defend our Father in Heaven and His plan. We must all defend our Savior and testify that He is the Christ, that His Church has been restored to the earth, and that there is such a thing as right and wrong.<br><br>If we are to have the courage to speak out and defend the Church, we must first prepare ourselves through study of the truths of the gospel. We need to solidify our own testimonies through diligent, daily study of the scriptures and by invoking Moroni's promise, which is that we can "know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5) if we seek it through humble prayer and study. Do not spend time trying to overhaul or adjust God's plan. We do not have time for such. It is a pointless exercise to try and determine how to organize the Lord's Church differently. The Lord is at the head of this Church, and we all follow His direction. Both men and women need increased faith and testimony of the life and the Atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ and increased knowledge of His teachings and doctrine. We need clear minds so that the Holy Ghost can teach us what to do and what to say. We need to think straight in this world of confusion and disregard for the things of God.<br><br>Sisters, your sphere of influence is a unique sphere--one that cannot be duplicated by men. No one can defend our Savior with any more persuasion or power than you, the daughters of God, can--you who have such inner strength and conviction. The power of a converted woman's voice is immeasurable, and the Church needs your voices now more than ever.<br><br>"Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid . . . : for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Deuteronomy 31:6). Take comfort in this counsel from Moses to Joshua as you let your voices be heard, for, as President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>You cannot simply take for granted this cause, which is the cause of Christ. You cannot simply stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and evil. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . You can be a leader. You must be a leader, as a member of this Church, in those causes for which this Church stands.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_stand-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stand up for Truth</a>," BYU devotional address, 17 September 1996]<br><br>Let us never forget that we are the sons and daughters of God, equal in His sight with differing responsibilities and capabilities assigned by Him and given access to His priesthood power as we make and keep sacred covenants and counsel together. Be careful that you continually strive to live and sustain the great plan of happiness that is our Father's revealed plan of salvation for His sons and His daughters. Surely we will be able to think straight if we stay focused on God's eternal plan and doctrine and use our strength in reaching out and helping others to do the same as we share our testimonies and our knowledge of the basic and simple message of the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The restoration of the priesthood power of God is the authority to do His work in helping to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children. Brothers and sisters, let us stand together, bound by our testimonies, and do our work just as did the Saints of Kirtland, Nauvoo, Winter Quarters, and Preston, England, in the 1830s and the 1840s.<br><br>I leave you my witness and my testimony that we are in a day and a time when we must stand in unity. We must stand together--men and women, young men and young women, boys and girls. We must stand for the plan of our Heavenly Father. We must defend Him. He is being pushed aside. We cannot stand idly by as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and allow that to continue to happen without being courageous enough to let our voices be heard.<br><br>May God bless you to have the courage to study and to know the simple truths of the gospel and then to share them every chance you get.<br><br>I leave you my witness, my testimony, that Jesus is the Christ. He is the Son of God. He does live. This is His Church we have been talking about, and I have been testifying to you of His great plan of happiness that He has given to us--all of which I do very humbly in the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>M.

<h1>e Meek Will He Guide in Judgment: and the Meek Will He Teach His Way&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I began my academic career I received a lot of counsel--some helpful and some not so helpful--from more senior colleagues. Suggestions were offered relative to teaching style and practices; interacting with administrators; navigating the university system for purchasing, travel, computer facilities, space, parking, etc.; involving myself in my professional organization; networking with my national disciplinary colleagues; getting my research started; and so on. While most of the counsel was welcome and beneficial, I remember very little of it today.<br><br>However, one curious suggestion made by a colleague elsewhere, who was just a few years my senior, has never left me. Very shortly after I joined the faculty at BYU, he pulled me aside at a professional conference and recommended that I start what he called my "AIG" file. Seeing the confusion on my face, he explained wryly, "'AIG' stands for 'Ain't I Great.'" My colleague suggested I keep the file in a handy drawer in my desk and that I add to the file any evidence, no matter how trivial, that would prove my professional distinction. He explained that the file might contain a positive letter from the editor of a prestigious journal or publisher, a note from a student explaining a life-changing classroom experience, documentation of changes made after attending a teaching seminar, and clippings from a local newspaper covering a research finding. This file, my colleague explained, would be used as ammunition for tenure and promotion, fodder for nominations for university and national awards, and leverage in salary negotiations or for positioning myself for job offers elsewhere--and to just generally build my ego.<br><br>My colleague's suggestion sounds extreme--perhaps even embarrassing--to most, but the fact is, we are in a profession that encourages this kind of thinking. We all know colleagues, hopefully in faculty appointments elsewhere, who seem to excel at self-promotion. Arrogance is an occupational hazard of the academy--and unsurprisingly so. Captive student audiences hang on our every word, and this can encourage in us a "know-it-all" mentality. We seek to lead and shape our disciplines with our scholarly contributions, and we hope for the attendant admiration of our disciplinary peers. There is sometimes the inclination to view access to resources and attention as a competition. Some expect the admiration of departmental colleagues, at the same time interacting with incivility and intolerance of opposing viewpoints. Scholars profess their work through writing, presuming someone will read their work and find it as groundbreaking as they themselves do. Indeed, the very title "Professor" carries with it stature and prestige that can be intoxicating. If we are not watchful, all of this can lead to an inflated view of ourselves and can create a culture of conceit.<br><br>This brings us naturally to the theme of this university conference: "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way" (Psalm 25:9). Despite the rather unflattering image of the academy I have drawn to this point, I am persuaded that our colleagues here understand and practice the declaration given in this simple couplet by the Psalmist. It is the meek who have access to heaven's instruction and guidance. The centrality of meekness in our spiritual growth, indeed our salvation, has been taught repeatedly, perhaps most often in the form of caution to avoid its opposite--pride.<br><br>We recall President Ezra Taft Benson's landmark 1989 general conference talk "Beware of Pride" (<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 4–7). This topic was revisited in President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's 2010 general conference address ("Pride and the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2010, 55–58). Both speakers have defined and taught eloquently about the spiritually corrosive nature of pride.<br><br>Although we at BYU understand the intimate coupling between the sacred and the secular, it is not my intention today to attempt to add to what prophets have taught. Rather, I hope to show today why meekness might be critical in a university environment. I wish to explore the indispensable nature of meekness, or humility, to our optimal functioning as teacher-scholars. I acknowledge that there may be definitional and etymological differences between these two words--<i>meekness</i>and<i>humility.</i>However, many fine dictionaries list the two as synonyms, and I will use them interchangeably today.<br><br>It is helpful at the outset to define what meekness is<i>not.</i>Rather than virtues to aspire to, humility and meekness have often been seen as signs of weakness. This is reflected in the dismissive and sometimes sarcastic tone, often humorous, with which humility is sometimes treated by the successful. Media mogul Ted Turner once quipped, "If I only had a little humility, I would be perfect" (quoted in Steve Cady, "A Brash Captain Courageous: Robert Edward Turner 3d,"<i>New York Times,</i>19 September 1977, 60). And pioneering architect Frank Lloyd Wright noted, "Early in life I had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility. I chose honest arrogance and have seen no occasion to change" (quoted in Herbert Austin Jacobs,<i>Frank Lloyd Wright: America's Greatest Architect</i>[New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1965], 19).<br><br>By contrast, note the following thoughtful observation from John Ruskin, the 19th-century art critic, social thinker, and philanthropist:<br><br><i>I believe the first test of a truly great man is his humility. I do not mean, by humility, doubt of his own power, or hesitation in speaking of his opinions; but a right understanding of the relation between what<b>he</b>can do and say, and the rest of the world's sayings and doings.</i>["Of Modern Landscape,"<i>Modern Painters,</i>vol. III (1856), part IV, chapter 16; emphasis in original]<br><br>The topic of meekness and humility may seem unusual for a gathering of accomplished professionals--you whom we encourage to excel, to profoundly influence malleable students, and to rise to the top of your disciplines. I believe this underlines the common misconceptions many have about the role of humility. What I have studied has persuaded me that humility and professional accomplishment are not mutually exclusive but, rather, are mutually reinforcing. I am confident that we will not reach our potential as faculty and as a university<i>without</i>this virtue.<br><br>Principally in the last decade and a half, behavioral and organizational science scholars have explored the dimensions and impact of humility in both individuals and institutions. Those studies have sought to measure it, identify its origins, characterize its impact, and study its development. We have colleagues at BYU who have contributed to this research, and I will draw some from their work today.<br><br>As I have reviewed the related literature I have found it interesting, as is so often the case, that these scholars' observations and conclusions, "discovered" so recently, have been known and taught by prophets for millennia. While these inspired teachings are critical to the salvation of mankind, this prophetic perspective has even greater importance to us, given Brigham Young University's mission and aims. Elder Neal A. Maxwell described in 1975:<br><br><i>Moderns elsewhere may, with anguish and clarity, use art to describe the dark and anguished human condition at forty fathoms in the sea of sin, but BYU, in the dispersing of its talents, seeks to add to the light rather than further describe the darkness, and the latter is a style that, unfortunately, is becoming normative.</i>["Why a University in the Kingdom?"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1975, 8]<br><br>Our annual university conference theme declares "the meek will he teach his way," which mandates the sifting of God's children to identify and reward only those who are meek enough to receive heaven's instruction. It was the Book of Mormon prophet Moroni who taught:<br><br><i>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . For none is acceptable before God, save the meek . . . ; and if a man be meek . . . , he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing.</i>[Moroni 7:43–44]<br><br>Thus meekness is prerequisite to charity, and as described so beautifully and metaphorically by the apostle Paul, charity (and, I will add, meekness, its antecedent virtue) "suffereth long, . . . envieth not; . . . vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up . . . , seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, [and] rejoiceth in the truth" (1 Corinthians 13:4–6). This is in sharp contrast to the culture of conceit that I earlier suggested can be the norm in our profession.<br><br>The multiple published studies in the behavioral and organizational sciences literature relating to humility have described three principal dimensions. For the remainder of my remarks today I wish to discuss each of these three, hoping to illustrate just how central humility is to Brigham Young University's progress in reaching its prophetic destiny.<br><h2><strong>Accurate View of Oneself</strong></h2><br>The first of the many dimensions of humility has been described by Professor June Price Tangney--a social psychologist at George Mason University and a pioneer in the field--as the ability and the willingness to see oneself accurately, including both strengths and weaknesses, neither unduly favorably nor unduly unfavorably (see "Humility: Theoretical Perspectives, Empirical Findings and Directions for Future Research,"<i>Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology</i>19, no. 1 [spring 2000]: 70–82; and "Humility," in C. R. Snyder and Shane J. Lopez, eds.,<i>Handbook of Positive Psychology</i>[London: Oxford University Press, 2002], 411–19). Ralph W. Sockman, noted Protestant preacher and author of books on Christian life, described this dimension this way:<br><br><i>True humility is intelligent self-respect which keeps us from thinking too highly or too meanly of ourselves. . . . It makes us modest by reminding us how far we have come short of what we can be.</i><br><br>The meek are capable of inspecting themselves objectively and are willing to do so, unafraid of what they will discover. Most of us are happy to recognize and have others recognize our own strengths. It takes the truly meek to look inside, individually and institutionally, and seek to openly characterize where we are. Such a characterization can only be done if we have a template for who we want to be, a target for who we want to become, and metrics by which to measure ourselves. We at BYU have the benefit of an inspired board of trustees to provide such a template for us. Without this defined objective we are destined to drift. Alice's request for directions of the Cheshire Cat as she made her way through Wonderland is instructive:<br><br><i>"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"</i><br><br><i>"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.</i><br><br><i>"I don't much care where--" said Alice.</i><br><br><i>"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.</i><br><br>[Lewis Carroll,<i>The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition</i>(New York: Norton, 2000), 65]<br><br>Having a destination in our quest for great degree programs and a great university is vital. This is the reason for departmental strategic plans, regular academic unit reviews, the rank and status policy, documented department expectations for teaching and scholarship, annual stewardship interviews, and so on. It is easy to meet the standard one has created after the work is done. It is much more difficult to develop an ideal and then seek to reach it at the risk of falling short.<br><br><i>Self-study</i>is a term we use frequently at the university--one that sometimes brings panic because of the work required and the fear of what might surface. An effective self-study requires meekness and the humility to define where we want to go at the risk of having to admit we are not there yet, what steps are required to get there, and how to track our progress. President Thomas S. Monson has said:<br><br><i>When we deal in generalities, we will never have a success; but as we deal in specifics, we will rarely have a failure.</i>["The Aaronic Priesthood Pathway,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, 43]<br><br>President Monson also liked to quote:<br><br><i>When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.</i>[In "Thou Art a Teacher Come from God,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>December 1970, 101]<br><br>We must quickly acknowledge that not all that is important to us is measurable. But isn't such self-inspection the predecessor of improvement--a nondefensive look at oneself to identify both progress and potential? Dare I say, isn't this<i>assessment?</i><br><br>The university hosts 141 different academic programs accredited by twenty-six different specialized accreditors. The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is the accrediting body for the university as a whole. Under Northwest guidelines we define our mission and objectives and propose metrics that we will use to gauge our progress. This involves the creation of university, program, and course outcomes--what we hope to achieve in the relatively brief time we have influence on students. This process involves formulating direct and indirect measures to gauge our achievement of those outcomes. Finally, the expectation is that having defined outcomes and having measured our effectiveness in achieving them using the various metrics we have put in place, we will then analyze the results and modify our methods in areas where we have not been successful. As we approach this process with humility, we can move from viewing it as "getting in the way" to "showing us the way." Without the humble recognition that we may do well in some areas and less well in others and that we can learn to improve, this process will be an imposed burden rather than an opportunity for growth.<br><br>Our next Northwest Commission accreditation site visit is scheduled for 2015. We have developed learning outcomes for all of our programs, and it is our expectation that we will undergo two annual cycles of collecting and analyzing assessment data and making changes in response.<br><br>One of the areas on campus that has not traditionally been assessment oriented is the College of Humanities. However, in the past seven years, under the leadership of a visionary dean, the college leadership has embraced this as a chance to improve. Each year the college hosts a summer retreat for faculty that they have titled Camp Assessalot. The retreat sequesters faculty from other distractions and, under college leadership, guides them through the rationale and process of assessment. Over these last few years the college program has gained faculty converts to the benefits of assessment. This is but one of many examples from our community where campus units are using the process as a path to stronger programs. I thank you all for your willingness--and some have even been pleasantly anxious--to help the university move forward in this way. I am confident that if approached meekly, the accreditation process will serve<i>us</i>rather than the reverse.<br><br>Seeing ourselves accurately applies not only to our personal professional pursuits but also to the community formed by this great institution. Understanding who we are institutionally--our beginnings, our unique aims, our special student body, our inspired board, and our place and role in the kingdom--is a blessed part of seeing ourselves accurately. This understanding does not threaten the need for and celebration of individual faculty accomplishments. Rather, with meekness this makes those accomplishments all the sweeter as they are seen to build and strengthen the university. Our clear view of who we are accelerates our progress as an institution.<br><br>One of our deans who spent two decades at a public university before joining us at BYU--roughly half of that in administrative leadership roles--recently told me, "Difficult decisions are much easier to make at BYU because of our shared vision of our mission. Because of that shared vision, egos and selfish desires take a backseat to the collective good." Humbly seeing ourselves individually as part of a wonderful whole brings collegiality, collaboration, and cooperation rather than the bitter feuding that stereotypically characterizes higher education.<br><br>Learning to comfortably discover who we are, warts and all, has other important advantages. While we may not be content with our status--the quality and productivity of our academic service--true humility will spare us the burden of worrying about how<i>others</i>see us. Elder Maxwell taught, with his remarks directed to the BYU community, that seeking the meekness exemplified by the Lord will bring this profound blessing: "and ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matthew 11:29). He explained further:<br><br><i>This is a very special form of rest. It surely includes the rest resulting from the shedding of certain needless burdens: fatiguing insincerity, exhausting hypocrisy, and the strength-sapping quest for recognition, praise, and power. Those of us who fall short, in one way or another, often do so because we carry such unnecessary and heavy baggage.</i>["Meek and Lowly," BYU devotional address, 21 October 1986]<br><br>In another setting Elder Maxwell taught how nurturing meekness purges from us the inordinate focus we often have on ourselves:<br><br><i>Without meekness, the conversational points we insist on making often take the form of "I"--that spearlike, vertical pronoun.</i>["Speaking Today: Meekness--A Dimension of True Discipleship,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1983, 71]<br><br>In a chapter entitled "Humility and Modesty" of their seminal book<i>Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification,</i>psychologists Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan and Martin E. P. Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania note that humble individuals are less driven to impress and dominate others, and they tend to be motivated less to collect special benefits for themselves. They observe further that there is a distinct benefit to being free from preoccupation with self--that of being free from the psychological burden of the need to maintain inflated self-images. (See Peterson and Seligman [Washington, DC: American Psychological Association; New York: Oxford University Press, 2004], 461–75.)<br><br>This first dimension of humility--being willing to understand and acknowledge accurately who we are--motivates us to focus less on what others think of us and more on what we think is important. It helps us direct our efforts to compete only with ourselves and our own histories rather than to compete with others. Perhaps this is what prompted the observation "People with humility don't think less of themselves. They just think about themselves less" (Ken Blanchard and Margret McBride,<i>The One Minute Apology: A Powerful Way to Make Things Better</i>[New York: William Morrow, 2003], 77).<br><h2><strong>Appreciative View of Others</strong></h2><br>The first dimension of humility I have explored today entails the ability to see oneself accurately. The second common element of humility identified by behavioral scientists is the capacity to accurately see others and their strengths and weaknesses without experiencing feelings of inferiority or feeling threatened ourselves. The willingness and ability of the meek to recognize the skills and successes of others without self-criticism or self-pity places them in a fertile position for improvement. Our doctrine should make quite obvious the importance of this element of humility. We know who man is, his origins, his purpose here, and his potential. Surely that knowledge should engender an appreciative view of others that does not diminish our own standing. With the reminder of this perspective we can see colleagues here and elsewhere differently. While there may be a few issues on which we do not compromise, meekness allows us to approach our interactions with others on a foundation of civility and respect. This is so very important in carrying out the business of the university and in our involvement with our disciplinary colleagues elsewhere.<br><br>Acknowledging generously the good work of others requires a confident meekness that often does not come instinctively to humans but is critical to achieving excellence in an organizational setting. It requires humility to continually look for the accomplishments of others and commend and recognize them for those accomplishments. Jim Collins, a former faculty member of the Stanford Business School and author of the 2001 management best seller<i>Good to Great,</i>noted the importance of this trait in building successful business organizations:<br><br>[Top level]<i>leaders are differentiated from other levels of leaders in that they have a wonderful blend of personal humility combined with extraordinary professional will. Understand that they are very ambitious; but their ambition, first and foremost, is for the company's success. They realize that the most important step they must make . . . is to subjugate their ego to the company's performance.</i>[Quoted in Simon Tankard, "The Challenge of Change,"<i>Business Brief,</i>August 2009]<br><br>It is in this vein that I wish to acknowledge the selfless service of our academic administrators and others who contribute through university service to the advancement of our work here. The work of deans and department chairs, as well as of committee chairs and members, is difficult and often thankless. Decisions must be made by these valued folks that affect their colleagues in significant ways--sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. With BYU's model of rotating academic leadership, these faculty administrators make difficult decisions, knowing that they will live subject to those decisions when they are replaced. I have heard one wise dean say repeatedly that administrators unselfishly do work that builds<i>other</i>faculty members' résumés.<br><br>I express my gratitude for what these chairs and deans do to build and enable their colleagues and the university. I also acknowledge with deep thanks the hard work of faculty curriculum committees, hiring committees, rank and status committees, assessment committees, faculty development committees, and so on. This labor reflects the unselfish mind-set of BYU faculty and comes because of the shared vision we enjoy there. Thank you.<br><br>In the context of accurately viewing others in nonthreatening ways, I might offer a word about students. Strong teaching is preeminent in who we are and what we value at BYU, and I commend you for your commitment to engaging, inspiring instruction. I see this clearly in student comments. Occasionally we hear about a faculty member who is belittling, demeaning, or rude. Knowing who our students are and who we are, this has no place here. I stress the importance of reciprocal meekness as we interact with students. We demand such meekness of them, and they can rightfully expect the same of us. Perhaps a verse from Doctrine and Covenants 84 can serve to guide us in our interactions with students.<br><br><i>And if any man among you be strong . . . , let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:106]<br><br>As we seek to elevate and inspire students "that [they] may become strong also," may there be rigor and lofty expectations and candid feedback. But in our rigor may meekness guide our responses to students, our classroom discussions, our office consultations, and our grading. Aside from the common decency, kindness, and courtesy that students should expect of teacher-scholars who are also disciples, if meekness is so important to learning, our students should see it modeled appropriately here.<br><br>One important facet of humility-inspired clarity in seeing others is gratitude. Humility within us at BYU spawns gratitude for strong mentors, responsive and helpful staff, ample and stable resources for teaching and research, a collegial environment, time to pursue the excitement of learning, extraordinary students--the list could go on and on. President Gordon B. Hinckley taught:<br><br><i>Our society is afflicted by a spirit of thoughtless arrogance unbecoming those who have been so magnificently blessed. How grateful we should be for the bounties we enjoy. Absence of gratitude is the mark of the narrow, uneducated mind. It bespeaks a lack of knowledge and the ignorance of self-sufficiency. . . .</i><br><br><i>Where there is appreciation, there is courtesy, there is concern for the rights and property of others. Without appreciation, there is arrogance and evil.</i><br><br><i>Where there is gratitude, there is humility, as opposed to pride.</i>["First Presidency Message: 'With All Thy Getting Get Understanding,'"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1988, 2–3]<br><br>In a higher education era of budget cuts, faculty furloughs, salary cuts, and discontinued programs, we at BYU have much to be grateful for. We have the support and trust of the board of trustees, whose generous appropriation of resources to the university is extraordinary at a time when so many other Church priorities are clear. I again express gratitude to our colleagues on the administrative side of the university who, despite several years of a challenging economy and their mandate to be fiscally self-sustaining, have economized and made available multiple positions from within their own ranks to augment the faculty ranks. While it may seem somehow counterintuitive, I believe meekly cultivating gratitude for any finite resource somehow extends that resource to our benefit.<br><h2><strong>An Openness to New Information</strong></h2><br>A third and final dimension to humility identified by social scientists that I would like to address today may be the most important and most relevant of the three for this community. Scholars have noted that true humility brings an openness to new information and a willingness to be taught. This would certainly be central in this business of education. Indeed, it would seem that humility is absolutely prerequisite to any learning. To acknowledge that there is something we don't know, that there is something new to discover or to study or to create, requires true meekness. Meekness, it would seem, does not just promote or catalyze learning; it activates learning. Elder Maxwell described the intimate coupling between meekness and learning this way:<br><br><i>Meekness is a friend, not a foe, of true education. Stephen spoke of Moses: "And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds" (Acts 7:22). Though Moses was a learned man, he was the most meek man "upon the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3). So it was that he could and did learn things he "never had supposed" (Moses 1:10).</i>["Meek and Lowly"]<br><br>The meek humbly accept correction, recognizing that it puts them on the path to improvement. Catholic theologian and author Father Thomas Dubay observed:<br><br><i>The humble person is open to being corrected, whereas the arrogant is clearly closed to it. Proud people are supremely confident in their own opinions and insights. No one can admonish them successfully. . . .<b>They</b>know--and that is the end of the matter. Filled as they are with their own views, the arrogant lack the capacity to see another view.</i>[Thomas Dubay,<i>Authenticity: A Biblical Theology of Discernment</i>(San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1997), 132; emphasis in original]<br><br>Bishop Richard C. Edgley related the following account of an encounter between the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, illustrating true humility in accepting correction:<br><br><i>In the presence of a rather large group of brethren, the Prophet severely chastised Brother Brigham for some failing in his duty. Everyone, I suppose somewhat stunned, waited to see what Brigham's response would be. After all, Brigham, who later became known as the Lion of the Lord, was no shrinking violet by any means. Brigham slowly rose to his feet, and in words that truly reflected his character and his humility, he simply bowed his head and said, "Joseph, what do you want me to do?" The story goes that sobbing, Joseph ran from the podium, threw his arms around Brigham, and said in effect, "You passed, Brother Brigham, you passed" (see Truman G. Madsen, "Hugh B. Brown--Youthful Veteran,"</i>New Era,<i>Apr. 1976, 16).</i>["The Empowerment of Humility,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2003, 98]<br><br>The meek not only<i>accept</i>correction, as shown by President Brigham Young, but they<i>seek</i>it. Dr. Atul Gawande is a Stanford-educated, Harvard-trained general and endocrine surgeon and now a faculty member at the Harvard Medical School. In a 2011 article in the<i>New Yorker,</i>Dr. Gawande wrote of how--having practiced surgery for nearly a decade and having performed more than 2,000 operations, most involving his specialty of endocrine surgery--he felt his skills had plateaued. His rates of surgical complications, a primary measure of surgical competence, moved lower and lower through the first few years of practice and then stopped moving.<br><br>Wanting to continue to improve, Dr. Gawande invited the retired surgeon from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston under whom Dr. Gawande had trained during his residency to evaluate his work. Arrangements were made, and his mentor came into the operating room to observe. The mentor stood on a stool looking over Dr. Gawande's shoulder; critically observed the entire operation, shifting his position periodically to change his field of view; and scribbled copious notes. Following the surgery this senior mentor provided feedback to Dr. Gawande--direct and specific and objectively critical--regarding his surgical technique, his management of the operating room and surgical process, and his interaction with the surgical staff.<br><br>In the months that followed, at Dr. Gawande's request the senior mentor observed other operations in Dr. Gawande's practice and reviewed videotapes of surgical procedures with him. Responding to the correction of his senior mentor, Dr. Gawande noted that his technique improved, he grew more confident in managing unexpected scenarios, and he was more comfortable in managing the operating room and assisting staff. Most significantly, at least to his patients, was that his rate of complications began again to fall. (See Atul Gawande, "Personal Best," Annals of Medicine,<i>New Yorker,</i>3 October 2011, 44–53.) This is the account of a surgeon of superb medical training with experience and elite professional stature who was nevertheless meek enough to<i>invite</i>correction.<br><br>The scriptural promise and caution offered by Jacob in the Book of Mormon is pointedly relevant here, teaching us that regardless of station or training, we must seek and welcome correction:<br><br><i>And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned . . . , who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, . . . yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall . . . consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.</i><br><br><i>But the things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid from them forever.</i>[2 Nephi 9:42–43]<br><br>Students resonate when faculty members they admire recognize they are at the limit of their own understanding and model the humility to acknowledge their limits and determine to keep learning. It is a powerful faculty member who will admit to being wrong to a student. Imagine the impact when students see faculty who are willing to make a mistake and willing to admit and correct it.<br><br>My best teacher as an undergraduate student at BYU regularly discarded his carefully prepared lecture notes and started over in his lecture preparation. By contrast, my worst teacher in graduate school lectured from the yellowed notes of his graduate school experience decades previous. Those meek enough to learn are better equipped to teach that process to students and to hold students to that standard in their own scholarship. I stress that modeling this trait to students should promote humility, not humiliation.<br><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><br>Given the necessity of humility in learning and teaching--that it is not only nice but necessary--one will logically ask, "Can humility be acquired?" The answer seems to be yes.<br><br>A recent study by Marriott School faculty Brad Owens reported in-depth interviews with business leaders at several hierarchical levels from a particular business sector. The study concluded that successful leaders are those whose management styles exemplify humility, enabling them to effectively model to followers how to grow (see Bradley P. Owens and David R. Hekman, "Modeling How to Grow: An Inductive Examination of Humble Leader Behaviors, Contingencies, and Outcomes,"<i>Academy of Management Journal</i>55, no. 4 [August 2012]: 787–818). The implication is that in the kind of environment created by strong and meek leaders, subordinates can and do change, with an attendant change in the culture of the organization. The implications for this environment are obvious.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin, who was something of a Renaissance man known for his diverse contributions to humanity, wrote in his autobiography of a deliberate decision to seek greater humility:<br><br><i>A Quaker friend . . . kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content with being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly.</i><br><br>Mr. Franklin related that he focused on acquiring this trait for the better part of fifty years:<br><br><i>I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself . . . the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so. . . . When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition. . . . I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.</i><br><br>He concluded with this pointed observation about the process of cultivating humility:<br><br><i>In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; . . . even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.</i>[Benjamin Franklin,<i>Autobiography</i>(1731–1759), http://www4.uwsp.edu/philosophy/dwarren/LOBenFranklin/AutobiographyBenjaminFranklin.pdf]<br><br>Section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants is entitled "the Lord's Preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation" (header to D&amp;amp;C 1). It would seem logical then that the revelatory counsel in this section would position the Latter-day Saints for the learning the Lord intended them to receive. The elements of humility explored today are clearly manifest in these verses:<br><br><i>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</i><br><br><i>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:25–28]<br><br>I conclude with a hope and a prayer that we will seek earnestly this most important of virtues: meekness. May we be meekly determined to understand who we are--our strengths and weaknesses--in an objective way that will provide a reference point for improvement. May we meekly see and appreciate others and their skills and accomplishments without being threatened, and may we be open in expressing those affirming observations to others. May we meekly welcome new ideas and new information from a variety of sources and be willing to accept and to invite correction. Social scientists are now confirming what heaven has known all along about the critical role of meekness in personal and professional progress.<br><br>The prophet Helaman, one of the fathers of the generation that would be privileged to welcome and host the visit of the Savior to this continent after His Resurrection, described the preparation of the people for that visit decades before the Lord's arrival. Helaman's description has been somewhat perplexing to me in the past, but it now comes into focus with improved understanding of the virtue that has been our topic today. Helaman wrote that his people "did wax stronger and stronger in their humility" (Helaman 3:35). As we embark on a new year of opportunity and promise, it is my hope that as faculty and as an institution we will wax stronger and stronger in humility and that, as our conference theme states, we will become the meek whom He will teach His way.<br><br><i><i>Brent W.

<h1> and Greatness - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Dear brothers and sisters, as we meet at this intersection of a too hot but too short summer and the beginning of a new fall semester, it is my privilege to welcome you again to our annual university conference. Today, as you know, we honor some of the many who have contributed much and brought increased distinction to Brigham Young University. It is also my privilege to make an annual report on some of the happenings, progress, and challenges we have and will face at this university we love.<br><br>Our thanks go to all of you who are attending. Among the happy faces I see are those who support every activity and assembly whenever they can. Likewise, we express especial welcome to our retirees and guests who have moved on in some respects but have never forgotten or lessened their loyalty and support for BYU. To those of you who are with us for the first time, let me again tell you how pleased we are that you have joined us. We look forward to getting to know you better and to seeing the contributions you will make.<br><br>For those who have been on campus over the summer, you have endured noise, dust, and detours as we have moved along with several of the construction projects currently under way. For those who have been away for a time, I suspect you have noticed a number of things that are different from when you were last here. The new Heritage housing buildings continue to be constructed, completed, and occupied. On the south side of campus the very large and impressive Life Sciences Building under construction continues to take shape, and we anticipate its completion in coming months. The addition to the Bean Museum is also on schedule and nearing completion. The utility tunnel project under way for several years with more to come is likewise on schedule.<br><br>Perhaps the most dramatic change for many is the first phase of a multiyear project to make our campus safer, more unified, more beautiful, and more pedestrian and bicycle friendly. While we already enjoy pleasing and delightful surroundings, we believe these modifications will help us be better positioned to serve our campus community even more in the future. Meanwhile, our construction has been occurring at the same time as the major construction of the water pipeline for the Central Utah Project on 900 East. It has been difficult and occasionally frustrating to get to where you would like to be on campus. Since these are largely summer projects, we anticipate a little more quiet and order as the fall progresses.<br><br>Because so much of what is done with respect to physical facilities on this campus is funded by Church appropriations, we might forget that we also have the privilege of helping advance the work even faster by raising the money to improve or add new buildings or for other initiatives. Currently we are in the process of raising money to build a new engineering building to complement the facilities we already have in the Clyde and other buildings. We believe engineering is not only a discipline in which the general need is greater than ever before, but it is also an area in which BYU can excel and contribute at an even higher level in the future than is possible currently. Our board of trustees has enthusiasm for this project, and we are grateful to loyal and generous donors as well as for the important work being done by LDS Philanthropies to bring this vital dream to reality in the not-too-distant future.<br><br>In some ways unsettling but also exciting have been the dramatic changes occasioned by the announcement of President Thomas S. Monson last October about the lowering of missionary ages for both women and men. Understandably and wonderfully this has changed the planning and circumstances of literally thousands of our students and prospective students. As a result, the same is true for the university. For this reason I will comment on a number of these issues in more detail than I would otherwise. The immediate impact on BYU is considerable, and the effects--largely positive--will persist for years to come.<br><br>Thousands of young women, now eligible to serve at nineteen, have chosen to submit their applications and serve as soon as possible. Thus we will have fewer second-year female students this fall semester than is typically the case for us. And with the eligible age for young men now at eighteen, we will also have fewer first-year men because a large number have chosen to serve directly after completing high school. For these reasons we have had a very small decrease in our student body size so far during 2013. We now anticipate that our student body will be lower by about 10 percent to 15 percent than is typical for fall semester.<br><br>A question frequently asked is why this slightly smaller student body needs to be? It is generally well known that with our very competitive admission standards, large numbers of students at other institutions would enroll in or transfer to BYU if given the opportunity. There are three basic reasons why we have not pursued this approach, even though we are aware that there are many who would like to come and could likely succeed at BYU if given the opportunity. Let me mention our considerations. Each reason could well justify our approach on its individual merits, and I present them without any particular priority or weighting. All are important.<br><br>First, our board of trustees has not increased our enrollment ceiling and seems unlikely to do so in the immediate future because of how very expensive an institution BYU is. While our numbers are down a little, we fully anticipate that those who have been studying here or those who have been admitted but have deferred enrolling until after missionary service will return to campus in large numbers starting in fall 2015. We will need to accommodate them and are preparing to do so.<br><br>Second, as I just mentioned, other colleges and universities with large numbers of Latter-day Saint students are also experiencing roughly the same phenomenon as we are, with large numbers of missionaries leaving soon. Since a significant number of remaining students might have come to BYU if given the choice, it is the concern not only of our leaders but also of ourselves that we do not exacerbate the already severe challenges being experienced at other institutions by bringing more of their students here and away from them. The budgets of state and other schools are generally tuition driven at a much higher level than occurs at BYU because of the tremendous generosity of our sponsoring Church. In all that we do, we wish to be good colleagues and neighbors.<br><br>Third, the Missionary Training Center is, as you know, located immediately to the north of our campus on ground that is jointly owned by the Church and BYU. With the dramatic increase in the number of missionaries to be trained and prepared, the MTC has looked to us to assist where we can, and our excellent BYU people have done a great job in working well with our MTC colleagues. Thus we have loaned, on a temporary basis, some student housing for the missionaries, and we also participate in all of the service functions necessary for that large, complicated, and wonderful facility. Just one example is that their weekly devotional service has been held here in the Marriott Center during the summer.<br><br>Over the long term, further developments and adjustments will be announced when appropriate by the Missionary Department and the Church spokespersons. It is a very exciting time for everyone, and we are grateful to be part of it in the context of our university responsibilities and this opportunity to support the Church in such a grand undertaking.<br><br>Some have wondered--exclusive of these and other physical changes and developments--what the eventual impact on the university might be. Obviously, we don't have all the answers, but we have every reason to be positive and optimistic. Let me share just one observation that I am confident will increase the effectiveness and quality of what transpires here.<br><br>Historically, after a fairly relaxed senior year in high school, many of our first-year young men have come to BYU planning to serve missions and looking for things to do until receiving the call to serve. It has been easy for them to defer important decisions about what major to pursue and also to delay being serious in their studies until returning from their missionary service. I believe most will agree with me that a mission contributes not only to the growth and vitality of the Church but also to the maturation and development of the missionary. Thus, in a couple of years, many of our entering students and those who will be returning will come with more highly developed study skills, increased self-discipline, and increased clarity about their life and academic goals. Our already impressive student body will become even more so with an earlier mission experience. And again, we must never overlook the great privilege accorded to us in helping advance the primary mission of the Church with respect to proclaiming the gospel to the world.<br><br>Like death and taxes, university accreditation continues to be on the front burner in many respects. Never has there been a time when accreditation, regulation, and reporting have been so pervasive and therefore so important to the well-being of the university. Given the unique aspects of our mission and values, it is extremely important that we do things of the highest quality generally and also make sure that they are well documented and understood. In all of this we are extremely fortunate to have Professor James D. Gordon III as our leader in Planning and Assessment. Let me share some of what we have posted on our website and also share with the Northwest Commission, our accrediting agency. This is what we have said about our assessment conclusions for the most recent reporting cycle:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University engages in assessment to make determinations regarding quality, effectiveness, and the fulfillment of its mission.</i><br><br><i>Four core themes, The Aims of a BYU Education, reflect essential elements of The Mission of Brigham Young University. "A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service." Each core theme has specific objectives which come from the university mission statement or The Aims of a BYU Education. Each objective is measured by indicators.</i><br><br><i>Annually the President's Council determines whether the indicators collectively demonstrate the achievement of the core theme objectives. If all the core theme objectives are achieved, then the core theme is achieved. If all the core themes are achieved, then the university meets an acceptable threshold of mission fulfillment.</i>["University Conclusions Based on Assessment for 2011–12," PDF at assess.byu.edu]<br><br>Our assessment results show that the university is fulfilling its mission. We are making progress regarding the assessment of learning outcomes across campus. All academic departments need to close the loop annually. They need to assess the achievement of their learning outcomes and report their conclusions on the learning outcomes website. They also need to report their actions or plans regarding improvement.<br><br>When the Northwest Commission evaluation team visits campus in 2015, it will look at entries written by the departments on the learning outcomes website. It will also visit some departments and ask them about their assessment processes. It may ask them what improvements they have made to their programs based on assessment. Each department needs to be prepared to answer these questions.<br><br>A primary purpose of assessment is improvement. As we evaluate our students' performance and thoughtfully take steps to improve, we will serve our students better and we will strengthen the university.<br><br>Please visit the website. While we have much work to do, we also have very much to celebrate. My sincere thanks go to all who work so hard in this important and necessary work.<br><br>In our large and diverse university community, change is rather constant. This is true not only with buildings, physical facilities, and programs but also with people. Recently we have welcomed Jennifer Paustenbaugh as our new university librarian. She replaced Scott Duvall, who has been interim university librarian for the last several months and now returns to his post as associate university librarian. Over the summer Brent L. Top has replaced Terry B. Ball as dean of Religious Education, Mary Ann Prater has succeeded K. Richard Young as dean of the McKay School of Education, and Lee Perry follows Gary C. Cornia as dean of the Marriott School of Management. To those retiring, I express our profound thanks for splendid service and loyal leadership. To those new in important assignments, we express our confidence, congratulations, and appreciation for your willingness to serve. As is always the case at BYU, these jobs are bigger than any of us who occupy them for a season. We are grateful that so many come so well prepared to serve and to lead.<br><br>Increasingly, much is being said and done on the national and international scenes with respect to innovative and new approaches to education. I believe Academic Vice President Brent W. Webb and his associates will go into more detail with the faculty this afternoon, but I wish to thank so many in our community who are working hard to make BYU even stronger, better, and more relevant with respect to delivering education in the best ways possible.<br><br>We have completed one year of a pilot program that has been designed to make available for on-campus students some general education courses that can be completed entirely online without a traditional classroom experience for that specific course. These have been coordinated with the campus calendar and have been generally well received by students and faculty alike. We will continue with their development and improvement during this coming academic year. A major advantage of this approach is that it helps alleviate the traditional bottlenecks and scheduling problems that our students often encounter, which in turn lead to delays in completion and graduation. I want to thank the faculty and administrators who are working so vigorously on this initiative. While some of the delivery is different, we cannot and will not compromise on the quality of our offerings or the sanctity of our values, so this has not been a small undertaking.<br><br>In a similar vein, we continue to see impressive progress in blended classrooms that use a variety of pedagogies, including online experiences as well as "flipped" classrooms that focus on implementing and applying new knowledge gained largely outside of the classroom. Questions are then answered when students gather with the faculty, rather than having classroom time used to dispense information. Some of our excellent course materials are being used elsewhere, and we continue to think about and carefully explore ways that MOOCs, or massive open online courses, might become a more significant part of what we do. Our efforts, just to be clear, are not so much in wanting to be fashionable or to be in the midst of current fads but in doing all we can to make sure that a BYU education is the best model it can be for fulfilling our long-stated and approved Mission and Aims for as many students as possible.<br><br>In athletics we have had an impressive and very successful past year. The women's soccer team capped a remarkable twenty-win season, with four victories in the NCAA tournament and an appearance in the Elite Eight, where they lost in double overtime to eventual national champion North Carolina. The team enjoyed tremendous support from the student body and community, posting the highest total attendance in the nation for the second year in a row.<br><br>The women's volleyball team also enjoyed outstanding success, winning the West Coast Conference championship and making it to the Round of Sixteen in the NCAA Tournament. Their twenty-eight wins were the team's most since 1999. Meanwhile, the men's volleyball team was ranked number one in the nation for most of the season and made their fifth appearance in the Final Four and National Championship games.<br><br>The football team won a school-record, fourth-consecutive bowl game, topping San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl. Ziggy Ansah was selected as the fifth player in the NFL draft, the highest pick for any defensive player in BYU history. That same day Ziggy celebrated the completion of his bachelor's degree in actuarial science.<br><br>The men's and women's basketball teams both excelled in postseason play. The women reached the quarterfinals and the men reached the semifinals of the NIT tournaments.<br><br>Other teams and individual athletes had outstanding seasons--so much so that the Cougars won the West Coast Conference Commissioner's Cup for overall team success. BYU also won both the Men's All-Sports Trophy and the Women's All-Sports Trophy, becoming the first WCC institution since 2008 to win all three awards in the same year.<br><br>BYU Broadcasting continues in its growth, prominence, and sharing of its message "See the Good in the World." BYU Broadcasting won eleven Emmy awards this past year, exceeding the combined total number of Emmys it has won in all prior years. The awards were for programming on both BYUtv and BYUtv International. The Catholic Academy of Communication Professionals awarded BYUtv's feature film<i>Silent Night</i>its prestigious Gabriel Award for Best Television Entertainment Program of the Year.<br><br>BYUtv launched a number of successful shows, including<i>Studio C,</i>the sketch comedy show starring BYU graduates, and<i>Granite Flats,</i>the channel's first scripted series, which was watched by 1.75 million television viewers and more than 60,000 online viewers in its first week.<br><br>In addition, BYUtv aired more than 100 live BYU sporting events nationwide and, to the delight of our WCC companion universities, seven non-BYU games from the WCC men's and women's basketball tournaments. They accomplished all of this with a small but exceptional professional staff and with the help of over three hundred student employees who play a role in almost every aspect of the operation.<br><br>As I believe everyone is aware, the work, accomplishments, and activities of Brigham Young University are becoming more widely recognized and appreciated than ever before. In the past year national media outlets have carried a variety of our stories and reports about faculty research and innovative student projects. Let me just mention a few examples by way of headlines without all the supportive information you can access later if you wish.<br><br>"BYU Study Says Exercise May Reduce Motivation for Food": This research was referenced in the<i>Wall Street Journal, U.S. News and World Report, Glamour Magazine,</i>and<i>Health Magazine.</i><br><br>"Tiny Cupid Proof That BYU Students Love Nanotechnology":<i>Wired, Yahoo, Discovery, Gizmodo, CNET,</i>and others highlighted the winning entry in a technology competition that showed how to build carbon nanostructures to make filtration systems.<br><br>"Research Shows Stepdads How to Avoid Missteps": The parenting writer at the<i>New York Times</i>reported this study performed by a faculty professor and a student coauthor who is now going on to study for a PhD in social work at the University of North Carolina.<br><br>"BYU Animators Take Home First-Place 'Student Emmy' for<i>Estefan"</i>: The Center for Animation won its twelfth College Television Award in ten years. The<i>New York Times</i>ran an in-depth article focused on the motivation and professional success of our student animators under the headline "When Hollywood Wants Good, Clean Fun, It Goes to Mormon Country."<br><br>Not to be outdone, our BYU engineering students built a car that registered a top mark of 1,331 miles per gallon in a national competition. The video made of this great success had more than 56,000 views in less than two weeks. Unfortunately this vehicle is slightly too small to accommodate a person of my size.<br><br>Well, we could go on and on. I have mentioned only a sample of the great work and contributions that are increasingly recognized and that are also bringing questions from good people who are interested in why BYU does some of the things it does.<br><br>Although not as well publicized or perhaps recognized, a great deal is also accomplished and contributed by a host of campus organizations and groups. In our Center for Service and Learning, for example, almost 25,000 student volunteers gave over 125,000 hours of service to more than thirty different service programs and initiatives as well as to countless individuals. We are very grateful for and proud of our students and our community for the service they render in ways that stretch far beyond our campus.<br><br>Now, if I might, I would like to spend my few concluding moments with you reflecting on the scriptural theme of our annual university conference from Psalm 25:9: "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way."<br><br>At first blush a university might not be the first place one looks to find examples of meekness, and it is not likely that a focus on finding models of meekness would be on university presidents. Neither I nor Vice President Webb, who will also speak to this theme this afternoon, wish to suggest that we personally deserve better or different expectations. It is because we believe meekness is not only good in the general sense but is very important in our own context, both individually and institutionally, that we address it.<br><br>As I have tried to honestly and somewhat dispassionately analyze some of my own mistakes and ways that I have handled matters less optimally than I should have, I conclude that a deficiency of meekness and associated virtues were chief contributors. Stated another way, if I had been more meek, more patient, more understanding of the challenges or problems facing others, and more willing to attribute positive motives rather than worrying about negatives, it is quite possible that my judgment would have been improved and I might have been more open to being taught by the Spirit in my actions.<br><br>As I try to make the case for the need for more meekness, I emphasize that those who believe this virtue to be synonymous with weakness or vacillation do not understand the scriptural connotation that I believe we should embrace. Sensitivity is not weakness, and the willingness to learn and then change an approach or a position is a very positive dimension of meekness. Likewise, patience is not vacillation but rather the recognition that many appropriate solutions and resolutions occur only in the process of time.<br><br>The Topical Guide in our LDS scriptures suggests that words similar to<i>meek</i>or<i>meekness</i>include having a contrite heart, being humble or having humility, and being poor in spirit or being teachable. I think all have application for us and for BYU.<br><br>Many years ago I read with some interest the description of Moses in the book of Numbers. I suppose that I was not unique in thinking of him as a very strong, forceful, courageous leader and prophet who was called and trusted by the Lord. Candidly, meekness never occurred to me as one of his characteristics, but these are the words of description from Numbers 12:3: "Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth."<br><br>Moses was a lot of things, but he was not wishy-washy or insecure in what he felt the Lord wanted him to do. He was courageous but careful. While perhaps initially resistant, he did accept counsel. He also gained understanding of his effectiveness when he acknowledged that he was much better in accomplishing his objectives with the help of others. This was evidence of his deep and genuine meekness.<br><br>I think we are all familiar with the experience Moses had with his father-in-law, Jethro. The practical advice about administrative delegation given to Moses is applicable and useful to all who have any leadership or administrative responsibilities. Let me share these verses from Exodus 18:13–24:<br><br><i>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</i><br><br><i>And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</i><br><br><i>And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</i><br><br><i>When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</i><br><br><i>And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</i><br><br><i>Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</i><br><br><i>Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</i><br><br><i>And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</i><br><br><i>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men</i>[and women],<i>such as fear God, men</i>[and women]<i>of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</i><br><br><i>And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</i><br><br><i>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</i><br><br><i>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</i><br><br>Moses then understood the wisdom that Jethro already had. That is, that counseling with colleagues and delegating responsibility are not signs of weakness but rather evidence of effectiveness in moving the cause forward. I am grateful that BYU has had a tradition consistent with this approach from the very beginning.<br><br>My gratitude continues to expand with my several years of experience here concerning the dedication, devotion, and competence of those who occupy the various levels and varieties of management and leadership responsibility here at BYU. Unlike the world generally and what typically occurs in many universities, department chairs, deans, managing directors, and other responsible senior leaders at BYU do not seek these positions. On the contrary, most who accept these invitations to serve do so with some reluctance but finally agree because of the love they have for our students, our colleagues, the university, and the faith that we represent.<br><br>Likewise, today--and I hope always--I express my profound gratitude to a board of trustees who make virtually all that happens here possible. Unlike any other institution of our size and complexity, we are supported in uncommonly generous ways. In addition, we have the great privilege of tremendous financial support, prayers, and encouragement from literally thousands who sustain us and cause the work to progress even faster than would otherwise be possible.<br><br>This is really a wonderful time to be at BYU. Yes, there are many problems and challenges in the world, and we are not completely immune from most of them. On the other hand, the university has never been better positioned to continue to move ahead in its quest to become the best that it can be. We have the sure understanding that what has and will transpire here is part of heaven's plan for the educating and uplifting of the children of God. This applies directly, of course, to those privileged to be here but also includes many who are influenced and educated for good by those who enter BYU to learn and then go forth to serve in ways members of our community demonstrate throughout the world.<br><br>As I conclude, let me again thank all of you and those who support us in various levels and varieties of ways for what is done to make this great enterprise of BYU possible. Let me also bear my solemn witness of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and the absolute reality and interest of our Father in Heaven and His Son in what transpires here. Our prophet leaders are in touch with heaven, and their support, together with the efforts of so many others, makes this university one of the crown jewels of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cecil O.

<h1>and Success - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always an exciting and satisfying opportunity to greet you at the beginning of a new semester. In my long experience of school beginnings, I have concluded that while all are positive in the sense that there has been yet little time for anything serious to go wrong, each new term is different in some ways from any other. This fall at BYU, for example, we have fewer first-year young men and fewer second-year young women as a result of the change in missionary ages announced by President Thomas S. Monson last October. I don't know what next year will bring, but in two years we will have more returned missionaries than ever before just starting their BYU careers.<br><br>To all of you I add my welcome and express my appreciation that you are here, whether for the first time or continuing your educational quests. And for those of you back from missionary or military service, a special greeting is in order. Likewise, we appreciate our nontraditional and bachelor of general studies students being with us.<br><br>This past July, on the way to a family excursion with my siblings and their spouses, Sharon and I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London, England, the morning after Andy Murray, a native Scotsman and British hero, won the Wimbledon tennis tournament. This major event in international professional tennis had not been won by a Brit in seventy-seven years before Murray's exciting victory. The UK media were filled with accounts of his dramatic win, and there seemed to be a national celebration over the outcome of this tennis match. Prime Minister David Cameron said he thought Andy should be knighted, although Murray himself reported he didn't think that was necessarily merited. His picture was on the front page of every newspaper, and, I am told, his success was the lead story on television for a few days.<br><br>This national pride is perhaps understandable and maybe even laudatory. What I found interesting was that there was little, if any, mention made of his serving faults, unforced errors, or games lost or any of the particularly excellent points scored by his opponent. The entire story would seem, if you didn't look at the match statistics closely, like a perfectly executed victory that was never in doubt.<br><br>The thought occurred to me that perhaps winning Wimbledon or another sporting contest is more like successfully completing the game of life or our BYU education than any of us might really expect. What I mean by this is that I believe the plan of salvation makes it possible for all of us--when we have tried to live our lives the best we can and have worked to overcome our mistakes and repent of our sins--to come to the Final Judgment or graduation and have the wonderful pronouncement made to us of "well done, thou good and faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21).<br><br>You might be thinking, "What has this to do with my work and study here at BYU?" That is a very good question. Because of my own experience and also because of my knowledge of your remarkable skills and abilities, I know that many, if not all, of you will meet with some things in the semesters and years ahead that you have not yet encountered in your academic lives. That is, you are now at a very serious university, surrounded by extremely capable classmates and a faculty that has unquestionably high expectations for your performance. What has served you well previously will not likely be sufficient to allow you to breeze through your course work without lots of hard work and also some possible disappointment and difficulty.<br><br>For some this leads to anxiety, depression, and questions about self-worth or worthiness to be here and a host of other negative or unproductive thought patterns. This is understandable but not helpful or true. We want you to do your best, be the best you can be, and aspire to perfection, but we also want you to be realistic about the circumstances in which you find yourselves. Personal growth comes from being stretched, and you will likely find yourselves challenged in ways you have never previously experienced or expected.<br><br>We are not in favor of slothfulness or laziness, but we also hope to help you guard against the all-too-common problem of perfectionism or being unrealistically hard on yourselves. To return to sports analogies, it is important to remember that even Jimmer Fredette and Tyler Haws occasionally miss a shot in otherwise wonderful basketball game performances. Before long it will be World Series time in baseball, and those of you who follow that sport understand that any player who can get a base hit three times in every ten at-bat opportunities is likely to be a hero even though he has made seven outs along the way. Even in a perfect baseball game the pitcher will throw a few balls in addition to lots of strikes. You can think of other examples that hopefully will enlighten and encourage you.<br><br>As I was kindly introduced this morning, mention was made of my career in medicine. My study of medicine in medical school and then in my internship, residency, and postdoctoral fellowship was very long and demanding, but it wasn't nearly as traumatic for me as was the process of trying to qualify for admission to medical school. In medical schools there is an honor society named Alpha Omega Alpha or AOA. For many of us--and this began early as undergraduates--AOA really stood for Always Overly Anxious.<br><br>Those of you who are contemplating entering competitive graduate programs will perhaps understand the thinking--often negative and distracting--that can occur when a student aspires to such a goal. One of the things that contributed for me and perhaps for others was unofficial communication that existed, apart from the assurances of advisors and faculty, among students, even at BYU, about what was really required to be admitted to the program or institution you hoped to enter.<br><br>In my undergraduate days and among the cohort of premedical students with whom I was studying was the sure conviction that one particular course in the array of required premedical classes was the key to being admitted or rejected. Put simply, if you got an A you got in. If you didn't, then too bad.<br><br>My time to take this class came, and I did what I thought was my very best work. I wasn't failing by any means, but on every examination, which occurred every couple of weeks, there were two or three questions or problems that I had neither anticipated nor studied for. The specifics were not found in my notes nor in the assigned reading, and, as a result, my scores were not what I felt I needed. Several of my classmates earned higher scores on these tests, and therefore I began to seriously doubt my own abilities. I determined to work harder, but all that increased was my AOA (always overly anxious) quotient and not my test performance. Needless to say, I did not get an A in the class. I was crestfallen and quite sure I would need to change my career plans, even though my performance in all my other courses was acceptable.<br><br>It was only sometime later that I learned that some of the people who performed better than I did in this particular class had copies of old examinations (I don't know how they obtained them, and I still don't) and that the professor tended to recycle his exams rather than create new ones. I discussed the matter with a trusted advisor who told me not to worry because I would be judged on my "body of work" and not just on one class. Only several years later when I became the dean of admissions at the medical school did I learn that what was rumored about the essentiality of this class--and we as students were sure it was absolutely true--was in fact false. The admissions committee knew about the course, the professor, and even the old examinations, and so rather than giving this course extra weight, performance in it tended to be discounted, particularly if achievement in other key courses was not also excellent.<br><br>While I may not have ever gotten completely over being AOA, I feel that the needlessly wasted, sleepless nights hindered rather than helped my academic performance. I am grateful that we have wonderful advisors and the counseling center here at BYU to help students who may have similar concerns or worries. Don't be afraid to ask for help, advice, and counsel. Remember that learning to deal with these issues is an important part of the educational maturation process. This is true for you and for me and has always been true for others.<br><br>Some of my favorite heroes, likely to be shared with many of you, have had major failures and disappointments in their lives to go with the great successes for which they are most likely to be remembered. Winston Churchill lost about as many elections as he won. We know, and give him credit for, his absolute determination during World War II. Among the things I have found most helpful is this statement attributed to him: "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."<br><br>Successful students are those who have realistic but dogged determination to work through whatever challenges or difficulties face them.<br><br>Abraham Lincoln was visionary and courageous. We don't dwell much on his far-from-perfect course to the White House, but he was the man for his time to preserve the nation and help us begin to overcome our troubled past. Although he was elected president, earlier he had lost elections to the state general assembly (or legislature) and also a campaign for the U.S. Senate.<br><br>George Washington, in my view, deserves all the credit he has received as the father of this country, but he also had his flaws and disappointments. As a general, he lost several key battles. He also owned slaves throughout his life, and although torn by his mixed feelings about that unfortunate and barbaric tradition, he never fully renounced it.<br><br>Some, including perhaps those who recognize their own failings and imperfections, have found it easy to find fault with Church leaders both current and in the past. Happily, we do not have a doctrine that anyone, including prophets and high Church leaders, is perfect. In fact, we understand that there has been only One, the Lord Jesus Christ, who made it through mortality without mistake, sin, or blemish. I will say more about that as I conclude in a few minutes.<br><br>We occasionally find among us those who feel their faith has been threatened by the alleged mistake or misstatement of a priesthood leader. The Prophet Joseph Smith was very clear in acknowledging his foibles or imperfections. He shared this account of his own teenage years:<br><br><i>I was left to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God. In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been. But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth, and is acquainted with my native cheery temperament.</i><br><br><i>In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections.</i>[JS--H 1:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>For me, I find encouragement that Joseph felt terrible about his weaknesses and imperfections. If he had been a medical student, perhaps he would have been an ideal candidate for AOA!<br><br>Another mistake young Joseph Smith made is not only well known but documented in the Doctrine and Covenants. I speak of his sharing with Martin Harris the 116 pages of the translation of the Book of Mormon that were subsequently lost. Joseph lost his power to translate for a season, but, after proper repentance, his gift to translate was restored. Think of this counsel a loving Lord gave to Joseph after this unfortunate event. This principle also applies to every one of us in our own individual struggles and efforts: "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided . . . ; but be diligent unto the end" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4).<br><br>And the companion scripture is found in the advice King Benjamin gave his people in his benedictory address after directly calling them to repentance and to live more faithful lives:<br><br><i>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</i>[Mosiah 4:27]<br><br>This was good advice those many years ago, and it is excellent advice for all at BYU today. We need to do our best, but we also need to recognize that we have some natural limits placed on our abilities so that we might grow by stretching but not breaking our capacities.<br><br>We would have none of this great counsel without the Prophet Joseph Smith. Nevertheless, we must remember that this great man and prophet was not completely immune from error in a few matters of lesser importance. He put it this way himself: "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught" (HC 6:366).<br><br>In 1842 Joseph recorded an experience he had with a group of Saints:<br><br><i>I told them I was but a man, and they must not expect me to be perfect; if they expected perfection from me, I should expect it from them; but if they would bear with my infirmities and the infirmities of the brethren, I would likewise bear with their infirmities.</i>[HC 5:181]<br><br>We all have infirmities or weaknesses, inconsistencies, and failings. We need to learn to bear with our own and also with those of others. We should not, as some people seem to do, have higher standards for others than we do for ourselves, but we also should not have unrealistically high expectations for ourselves. If we do, we are in effect failing to recognize not only the blessing but also the essentiality of the Savior's Atonement in the Father's plan for each of us.<br><br>Remember these words of Alma to the people of Gideon as he described the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i>[Alma 7:11–12]<br><br>Our pains and infirmities include much more than our sins and illnesses. They include our mistakes, our failures, and our disappointments. These we must have to gain essential experiences, but we also need to understand that we can find in the Savior's sacrifice for us every compensation and help we require to overcome all that vexes or frustrates us when we have done our part, which includes our best efforts.<br><br>May God bless us in our struggles with the knowledge that the Father and the Son are there for us and will bless us in our studies, in our personal lives, and in our efforts to become more like Them, because They do live and Their promises are real for each of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Cecil O.

<h1>Laugh Or Shall I Cry? The Power of Humor - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to stand before you this morning and welcome each of you to fall semester at Brigham Young University. This summer has passed very quickly for me, and I would imagine that it has for you also. I would surmise that there were fun times, work times, family times, and possibly even challenging times.<br><br>I hope that all of you will now have a very successful school year. For some this is a new adventure: you are freshmen. Others are experienced at the rigors and excitement of university life, whether you were here previously or have transferred from elsewhere. The days ahead await you. There are going to be days when you are calm and serene. There are going to be days when you are stressed. There will be times of success and times of failure. There will be joys and sorrows that affect you periodically. However, I do wish for each of you that there will be many occasions of laughter.<br><br>I remember a saying that I heard once: "A good laugh a day keeps the blues away." I believe that humor in life can enable you to cope with the challenges and trials that come your way. You can be buoyed up through laughter and mirthful experiences and stories. There is strength in laughter that can give you the means to overcome difficulties and enable you to keep life's ups and downs in perspective and balance.<br><br>Last summer my husband and I went on a cruise with his siblings and their spouses. There were ten of us, and we had a wonderful time. On our last evening together, eight of us were sitting at a round table chatting, and a soft drink was requested by a sister-in-law. The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the brim. As he reached out to give it to her, he dropped it in the middle of the table. Its contents went everywhere, and we all went into panic mode and started trying to clean it up. I had it all over my face and started wiping it away. The distraught waiter grabbed towels and tried to soak up the liquid in them. Then we all heard a voice from one of our group, speaking loudly: "Hey, anybody got a straw?" Laughter took over. Any tension was dissipated. This witty remark had given ease to an uncomfortable situation--especially for the young man who had accidentally created it. Laughter has a way of doing that. Finding jocularity and amusement in an embarrassing or uneasy circumstance can be a great means of communicating that it's all right, we understand, or we're here to help.<br><br>In Proverbs 17:22 we learn that "a merry heart doeth good like a medicine." If you are merry and joyful and demonstrate these attributes in daily actions, you will be happy and create an atmosphere of cheerfulness that can bless the lives of your associates, friends, and especially family. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, counseled that whatever comes your way, "be of good cheer" (John 16:33). What enables you to be of good cheer? It is your knowledge of His Atonement and all the blessings that are available for you as a result of it.<br><br>Each of you is given the choice to be an optimist and smile or be a pessimist and frown. Striving to develop a sense of humor in facing daily tasks is a work in progress. It isn't always an easy or simple trait to acquire. Sometimes it may appear to be impossible. You will face some obstacles in your studies, employment, church callings, interpersonal relationships, and many other undertakings. These are times when you will have the choice of whether to laugh or cry, smile or frown. Sometimes life's circumstances may seem to be in turmoil, and you may have so much on your so-called "plate" that you don't know where to begin or what to do. This is when I believe humor and the ability to be optimistic can enhance the quality of your life. Elder Hugh B. Brown said, "One must have a sense of humor to be an optimist in times like these" (<i>The Abundant Life</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965], 50).<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley and his wife, Marjorie, were wonderful examples during their lives of optimism and humor. Sheri L. Dew's description of them mentions that "Gordon and Marjorie were attracted to each other's sense of humor, love for the gospel, innate optimism, and love of life" (<i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 106). Sister Dew also described their marriage as one in which "Gordon's dry wit delighted Marjorie, who loved the fact that although her beau was practical, self-disciplined, and serious about the things that mattered to him, he didn't take himself very seriously and was often the first to poke fun at his own quirks" (<i>Go Forward,</i>106).<br><br>Listen to the words of Sister Hinckley as she gave advice on the way to get through life:<br><br><i>Another thing that we tried to do is not take ourselves too seriously. You get into a lot of trouble when you do that. I tried to laugh instead of cry when you felt like crying. It was always better to laugh,</i>[like]<i>the day I took a beautiful casserole from the oven and my six-year-old boy said, "Mom, how come you baked the garbage?" Children are like that. There are days when it is hard to laugh.</i>[Marjorie Pay Hinckley, BYU Women's Conference, 2 May 1996; see also Marjorie Hinckley in<i>Glimpses into the Life and Heart of Marjorie Pay Hinckley,</i>ed. Virginia H. Pearce (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1999), 61]<br><br>This is insightful advice from a witty, cheerful, and gentle woman that we would be wise to follow.<br><br>In another instance of speaking concerning laughter, Sister Hinckley added, "The only way to get through life is to laugh your way through it. You either have to laugh or cry. I prefer to laugh. Crying gives me a headache" (Marjorie Pay Hinckley,<i>Small and Simple Things</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2003], 126; also<i>Glimpses,</i>107).<br><br>Laughing instead of crying helps you to move forward and face your challenges as you fill your lives with the virtuous, lovely, and praiseworthy things of life. Good effects can come from communicating with humor and laughing with friends and family.<br><br>Hopefully you are all aware that humor and laughter can also be abused. It must never be used to degrade or embarrass others. It never should involve profanity or the denigration of the sacred and spiritual aspects of your lives. Always be sensitive to the feelings of others. Don't be malicious or thoughtless in words or actions to any of your associates--especially loved ones.<br><br>Sometimes, laughing at yourself and with others can create friendships and memories that last forever. Can you find humor in something that happens to you when your choices are to laugh, cry, or possibly become angry? Can you, as was described of President Hinckley, not take yourself too seriously? Each of you has had and will continue to experience these types of incidents. How do you respond?<br><br>I enjoy the story of J. Golden Kimball--a General Authority for over fifty years beginning in the 1890s--when he could have responded with anger to an action by another individual. The following was reported by his grandnephew, Jim Kimball:<br><br><i>On a snowy day two weeks before Christmas, he was crossing South Temple to the north door of ZCMI</i>[a department store in downtown Salt Lake City].<i>He walked slowly to the middle of the ice-slick street.</i><br><br><i>A woman burst out of the north door of ZCMI with a pile of packages in her hands and no clear line of sight.</i><br><br><i>She plowed right into Golden.</i><br><br><i>Packages flew everywhere. Golden was knocked down and the woman fell on top of him. Together they began to slide south towards the curb.</i><br><br><i>All traffic stopped. Everyone stood entranced by this most unlikely sight.</i><br><br><i>They slid until they hit the curb. It was then that the woman realized someone was beneath her. She brushed the snow away and exclaimed, "Oh, Brother Kimball, it's you! Speak to me. Are you all right?"</i><br><br><i>"It's all right, Sister, but you'll have to get off here," he painfully croaked. "This is as far as I go."</i>[James Kimball,<i>J. Golden Kimball Stories: Mormonism's Colorful Cowboy</i>(Salt Lake City: White Horse Books, 1999), 90]<br><br>The ability to not take oneself too seriously and to use humor in times of mistakes, small and accidental incidents, and stressful situations can help alleviate embarrassment, fear, and even discouragement in circumstances such as these. Elder J. Golden Kimball demonstrated this perfectly.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, there are times in our lives when it is very difficult to smile and especially to laugh. There are periods of anguish and suffering when only the gospel perspective brings us comfort as it reminds us of those eternal things that really matter. All of us have had such times in one way or another and will continue to have them in the future. It is part of God's plan for us. Smiles can come to us, however, as we recall many fond memories of good times, love shared, blessings received, and the knowledge of the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>There is an expression I use at times when life seems to throw an unexpected and unwelcome curveball. It is one I heard years ago, and I have used it many times to put some incidents in perspective. It states: Crisis plus time equals humor. Many times throughout life this can be true. I am sure that each of you can recall some incident in your life when something occurred that caused unhappiness, inconvenience, stress, loss, and so forth that you can laugh and smile about now after the passage of time.<br><br>Let me tell you a personal experience as an example of what I mean. Almost twenty years ago my husband and I arrived in Rome, Italy. After disembarking from our flight, we walked to the train station with our son, who spoke Italian, in order to purchase some train tickets to travel in other areas of the country. We set our luggage down by a wall, and I was given the assignment of watching and guarding all of it as my husband and son went to a ticket booth. As I was standing there, silently looking around, a man approached me and spoke in broken English asking about the metro train located right outside the door. At the time the thought came to my mind, "Why is he asking me about the train? He knows I am a tourist and don't know anything." I explained that I was sorry but really couldn't help him, and he went on his way. I continued waiting for my husband and son to return.<br><br>When the two returned with the purchased tickets, my husband looked around and with a concerned and puzzled expression on his face asked me, "Where is my briefcase?" It took me only a second to realize why that man had asked me a question he knew I could not answer! There were two doors behind me--one on each side of the luggage. He was distracting me while another equally despicable individual reached around in back of me and stole the briefcase. I ran out of the door to see if I could see him, but, as you would guess, he was nowhere to be seen. I had let myself become distracted from my assignment, and our trip began on a very low note.<br><br>Among many assorted items that included my husband's scriptures, we also lost our plane tickets, passports, and some money. To make a long story short, instead of spending our first day seeing the wonderful sites of the Eternal City, we spent it at Delta Airlines and the United States Embassy. You can imagine what my picture looked like on my new passport acquired that day. It will not be shown as a visual aid.<br><br>I tried to look for anything positive. For example, maybe he or a family member would read the Book of Mormon and become converted. Then we would receive a note of apology and our stolen items would also be returned. Of course, as of today, it has never happened.<br><br>Now you can be assured that there were tears shed--mine. It was not a jovial and comical matter. At the time my husband, son, and I could find no humor in this situation. I felt responsible for creating a circumstance that caused our vacation to be miserable at the outset. However, remember the previous statement: Crisis plus time equals humor. My family and I can now laugh about what happened in Rome, even though at the time it was no laughing matter. We joked the following December that we wouldn't be able to purchase any Christmas presents because Mom let the briefcase get stolen. Now it is truly a memorable part of our family history. We can recall what we felt like then and compare that with what we feel now. This experience created a bond in our family that enables us to know that when mistakes are made, difficult situations arise, and tears are shed, it is our relationship that really matters and the love we have for each other.<br><br>In conclusion, my dear friends, I know of no other people in the world who are happier and more cheerful than you, the students of Brigham Young University. When dignitaries and visitors from places throughout the world enter this campus for various reasons--especially those unfamiliar with it--they notice and feel something very different from what they have encountered elsewhere. They comment that you seem so happy. You smile and respond to them in a friendly manner. You like to laugh. You seem to enjoy associating with each other. You impart strength and confidence. They want to know why.<br><br>We know why. You are filled with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are representatives of Him. He told you to be of good cheer, and you are. You are happy because you are striving to achieve worthwhile goals. Amid your daily challenges and struggles you smile, laugh, and encourage others. I so encourage you to continue to do so during your sojourn here and as you "go forth to serve."<br><br>I have a testimony that our Heavenly Father lives and that He loves each one of us. We have a prophet, Thomas S. Monson, who is a perfect example of an optimistic and cheerful man. He smiles, he laughs, and he teaches us. May we always listen and follow him is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Sharon G. Samuelson, wife of BYU President Cecil O.

<br>
<h2><strong>Introduction--It Is Easier to Avoid Temptation Than It Is to Resist Temptation</strong></h2><br>The focus of my message today is based on a proverb from Solomon, who was given a gift from God of "exceeding" wisdom, "and his fame was in all nations round about. . . . And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon."<sup>1</sup>Even 3,000 years later, when we read Solomon's proverbs we often nod in agreement with his profound wisdom because life has also taught us the same lesson--often through a trying or difficult experience.<br><br>If life hasn't yet taught you the wisdom of the proverb I am about to share, it would be my prayer that by the end of my remarks it will have enlightened your understanding and touched your hearts sufficiently to motivate you to make some helpful and wise changes in your life. Here is the proverb: "Enter not into the path of the wicked. . . . Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away."<sup>2</sup>The wisdom of Solomon in this passage is to be discovered in the word<i>avoid.</i>Solomon had discovered, as all wise people do, one of life's most helpful guiding principles:<i>It is easier to avoid temptation than it is to resist temptation.</i><br><h2><strong>Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong></h2><br>To illustrate the wisdom of this principle, let's suppose my great temptation in life is chocolate chip cookies and I'm trying to conquer the temptation. It is easier for me not to have the cookies in the house than it is to walk through the front door and smell two dozen of them fresh out of the oven--warm, moist, and smelling good. At that moment I am no longer simply fighting temptation; I am also fighting chemistry. The aroma triggers the pleasure center of my brain. My mouth begins to water in preparation for the cookies. With each tempting breath my resistance grows weaker as my craving grows stronger and my appetite begins to overpower my reason and resolve.<br><br>My other self--the one that is carnal<sup>3</sup>--argues in favor of the cookies: "You know, dieting doesn't have to mean deprivation. It's your overall effort that counts, and one cookie certainly isn't going to blow your diet." With my pleasure center activated, I don't need much convincing, and I yield to the cookie's enticing aroma.<br><br>How easy is it to stop when that first cookie only intensified your appetite rather than satisfied it? That same voice says, "Well, you've blown it now! You may as well enjoy yourself and recommit to your diet tomorrow." So after I've eaten about six cookies, maybe with a glass of milk, I begin to feel remorseful about breaking my resolution and diet.<br><h2><strong>Hormones, Intimacy, and Families</strong></h2><br>I hope you will understand the metaphor as I now apply it to a far stronger desire. The Lord has blessed each of us with powerful hormones that also link to the brain's pleasure center. It is a very desirable attraction that begins to occur in adolescence toward the opposite sex.<br><br>Along with the many spiritual reasons that inspire a person to get married, the Lord has also blessed us with this powerful physical drive, with this intense chemistry, to motivate us to get married--to be fathers and mothers, to have children and a family of our own, and to strengthen the loving bonds between husband and wife. Why? According to "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," it is because "the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children."<sup>4</sup>The proclamation also states "that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife."<sup>5</sup><br><br>The booklet<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>(which could also be called<i>For the Strength of Young Single Adults</i>) states:<br><br><i>Physical intimacy between husband and wife is beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Youth often grow up with an incorrect understanding of intimacy and an unhealthy attitude toward it because it is often treated as a taboo topic rather than as a sacred one. Because intimacy in marriage is beautiful, sacred, and ordained of God, it is important to understand that sexual sin isn't the use of something inherently bad but the misuse of something inherently good and beautiful.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Alma taught his son Corianton that the misuse of the sacred procreative powers outside the bonds of marriage was "most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost."<sup>7</sup>Alma cautioned his son to "go no more after the lusts of [his] eyes"<sup>8</sup>--a phrase that could easily apply to pornography in these latter days.<br><h2><strong>David and Joseph</strong></h2><br>In the Old Testament we read the story of David, who did go after the lusts of his eyes. Arising from his bed at "an eveningtide," he "walked upon the roof of the king's house." And from the roof he looked down and saw a lovely chocolate chip cookie--out of its wrapping. The cookie "was very beautiful to look upon" and smelled really good.<sup>9</sup>David was not simply dealing with temptation but also with powerful chemistry, and he succumbed to the enticing power and aroma of the cookie.<br><br>Conversely, we have the story of Joseph, who was in Potiphar's house when his master's wife began to seduce him. He was in the kitchen with the cookies. What did Joseph do? Well, he didn't stick around to smell the cookies. "He left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."<sup>10</sup>He got out of the kitchen. It is easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.<br><h2><strong>The Lord's Prayer</strong></h2><br>A humorous bumper sticker states, "Lead me not into temptation. I can find it myself!" What the Lord's Prayer actually states, according to the Joseph Smith Translation, is, "Suffer us not to be led into temptation."<sup>11</sup>The Savior's counsel in this phrase is to pray for help in<i>avoiding</i>temptation. Ponder on these several additional avoid scriptures:<br><br><i>Come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br><i>Keep . . . uncleanness<b>far</b>from you.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br><i>Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>In teaching prayer, one of the foremost principles taught by the Savior was avoiding temptation, such as in this counsel that is repeated in many scriptures:<br><br><i>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>This entreaty of the Savior to avoid temptation consists of two acts of faith: to watch and to pray. The Guide to the Scriptures teaches us that to<i>watch</i>means "to be vigilant, to [be on] guard," which is wise advice in defending ourselves against a very real and ever-lurking enemy. And the corollary to the Savior's wise advice to pray to avoid temptation is that without prayer, we will not have the spiritual strength or stamina to win this battle on our own.<br><h2><strong>"Sin Lieth at the Door"</strong></h2><br>How can we pray that we enter not into temptation if we don't pray in faith or, in other words, do all in our power to make the prayer come true? The first step we should take, if we have prayed in faith to avoid temptation, is to close the door on it and avoid it completely.<br><br>It has been said that "temptation usually comes in through a door that has deliberately been left open."<sup>16</sup>Many pray to be delivered from temptation, but they leave the doorway to temptation cracked just a bit, convincing themselves that nibbling isn't partaking and that the Lord "will justify in committing a little sin."<sup>17</sup><br><br>An age-old proverb states, "An open door may tempt a saint." Moses warned of the danger of leaving the door ajar: "Sin lieth at the door, and Satan desireth to have thee."<sup>18</sup>All Satan needs to gain access to your pleasure center is a cracked door and a sweet aroma. From there, President Spencer W. Kimball said, "Lucifer . . . will use his logic to confuse and his rationalizations to destroy. He will shade meanings, open doors an inch at a time, and lead from purest white through all the shades of gray to the darkest black."<sup>19</sup>The key is to not leave the door cracked open. Satan cannot open the door from the outside.<br><br>"Of a truth," said Elder Neal A. Maxwell, "temptation is not a gate that can be opened by force of arms; it opens only inward, as moved by the arm within, for each man is the gatekeeper of his soul."<sup>20</sup><br><h2><strong>The People of Ammon</strong></h2><br>When the people of Ammon were converted to the Lord, they didn't hang their swords above the mantel. They buried them. They were not only avoiding temptation but completely closing the door on temptation. They were also putting reminders of their past behind them in a spirit of true repentance:<br><br><i>We will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day. . . .</i><br><br>And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again.<sup>21</sup><br><br>We are taught to not touch the "unclean things"<sup>22</sup>and to avoid even the very "appearance of evil."<sup>23</sup>Our prayer should be as Nephi's: "Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?"<sup>24</sup><br><br>The following are examples of things we might do to close the door on temptation and act in faith to fulfill our prayer to avoid temptation:<br><br>• For dieters, it would be wise to get rid of the junk food in the cupboard and to not go grocery shopping when you are hungry.<br><br>• For Internet junkies, it may mean deleting the game on your smartphone that you are addicted to.<br><br>• Many married people unwisely crack the door to temptation by "friending" old boyfriends or girlfriends on their social media site. Avoiding temptation would mean to unfriend them before Satan cunningly destroys a marriage.<br><br>• Avoiding temptation may mean putting a filter on your computer that blocks the material that is offensive to the Spirit.<br><br>• It may mean programming your television to block certain channels or even unsubscribing to a cable or streaming service that is enticing you with inappropriate offerings.<br><br>• And it may mean breaking up with that boyfriend or girlfriend who has not demonstrated virtuous thoughts or behavior.<br><br>I invite you to think about your greatest temptations and then to ponder and pray about what you can do to avoid them in the future. I then invite you to wisely follow through on the avoidance revelation that comes to you.<br><h2><strong>"Never Make the Same Mistake Once"</strong></h2><br>Another nugget of wisdom and counsel on avoiding temptation comes from President Boyd K. Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. You'll have to pay close attention to capture the deeper meaning of this one-sentence sermon: "Never make the same mistake once."<sup>25</sup><br><br>The wisdom of this intriguing principle alerts us to the danger of traps that are so effective that they don't need a second chance to ensnare their victims--think of a spider web. Satan would have you believe that there is little or no lasting harm in trying something just once. But yielding to Satan--even once--has trapped many curious victims in a lifelong battle against that vice.<br><br>President George Albert Smith cautioned:<br><br>If you cross to the devil's side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter's power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the Lord.<sup>26</sup><br><br>When we yield to temptation just once, we give Satan ammunition in the form of a memory. What makes Satan the tempter is his ability to plant thoughts in our mind. In a moment of weakness he can tempt us with the memory of our experience, which multiplies the potency of the temptation--like the mouthwatering memory of enjoying a delicious chocolate chip cookie.<br><br>For the curious, you don't have to yield to temptation to acquire a knowledge of the vice. Benjamin Franklin wisely counseled, "'Wise men,' as Poor Richard says, 'learn by others' harms; fools scarcely by their own.'"<sup>27</sup>Observing the life-shattering effects that sin and addictions have had on the lives of others should terrify you of ever getting near that vice--even once. "'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them," Franklin said.<sup>28</sup><br><br>For an alcoholic, which of the thousands of glasses drunk over years and decades was the most dangerous? Número uno. It is easier to avoid the first glass than to resist the thousands that will likely follow. Not doing something the first time is avoiding; the second time and beyond is resisting. President Packer's counsel is profound: "Never make the same mistake once."<br><h2><strong>He Will Lull Them</strong></h2><br>Another cunning strategy used by Satan to trick good people into temptation was foreseen by Nephi: "At that day [meaning our day] will he<i>pacify,</i>and<i>lull</i>them away into carnal security, . . . and [lead] them away carefully down to hell."<sup>29</sup>The words<i>pacify</i>and<i>lull</i>in this verse are synonymous with the word<i>desensitize.</i><br><br>Let me show you a picture from a Mormonad of a frog jumping from a pan of hot water.<sup>30</sup>If Satan wanted to boil a frog, he wouldn't put it in a pan of hot water--it would instinctively jump. His strategy would be to put it in cold water, because that is what the frog is used to. He would then turn on the heat, unbeknownst to the frog. Satan would make sure that the temperature rose so gradually that the frog would never notice it change from cold to cool, from cool to tepid, from tepid to warm, from warm to hot, from hot to energy-sapping hot, and from there to boiling.<br><br>How many of you women have gone into a department store to purchase a bottle of perfume? What happens to your nose after you smell about five or six bottles of perfume? Your nose becomes desensitized from overexposure to too much stimuli. Wikipedia defines<i>desensitization</i>as "diminished emotional responsiveness to . . . stimulus after repeated exposure to it."<sup>31</sup><br><br>Avoiding temptation protects us from becoming desensitized to it. But if we tolerate it while striving to resist it, we can gradually become desensitized without even knowing it.<br><h2><strong>Movies</strong></h2><br>Let's take movies as an example. We know that "the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance,"<sup>32</sup>but Hollywood can and does! And many good members of the Church allow themselves to "look upon sin" in movie theaters with a great degree of allowance or tolerance, justifying it in the name of "good entertainment with just a few bad parts."<br><br>Let's assume that the two ends of the basketball court here at the Marriott Center represent the two extremes of movies that Hollywood produces. We will have this end area at my extreme right represent G-rated movies. At the other extreme to my left is what Hollywood calls "adult entertainment." In between the two extremes the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) gives movies ratings of PG and PG-13. We will have this pulpit represent R rated, then NC-17, and adults only. In between the two extremes, where do we draw the line over which it would be dangerous to cross?<br><br>It is risky for the Church to draw a line. If the speed on the freeway is sixty-five miles per hour, how fast will people drive? Well, they will feel free to drive as fast as the limit. If the Church were to draw a line with movies, that would be like giving permission to watch everything up to the line. President Gordon B. Hinckley never drew a line. Neither has President Thomas S. Monson. But the prophets have taught us principles found in<i>For the Strength of the Youth,</i>such as the following:<br><br><i>Do not attend, view, or participate in anything that is vulgar, immoral, violent, or pornographic in any way. Do not participate in anything that presents immorality or violence as acceptable.</i>33<br><br>President Hinckley taught, "Avoid pornography as you would a plague."<sup>34</sup>Did you notice his use of the word<i>avoid?</i>President Monson has said, "<i>Avoid</i>any semblance of pornography. It will desensitize the spirit and erode the conscience."<sup>35</sup><i>For the Strength of Youth</i>states:<br><br><i><b>Avoid</b>pornography at all costs. It is a poison that weakens your self-control, destroys your feelings of self-worth, and changes the way you see others. It causes you to lose the guidance of the Spirit and can damage your ability to have a normal relationship with others, especially your future spouse.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>Did you catch that? It can damage your ability to have a normal relationship with your future spouse. That isn't merely conjecture. Thousands of cases bear witness of its destructive impact on the marriage relationship.<br><br>In 1986 President Ezra Taft Benson warned members of the danger of anything "R rated" or beyond.<sup>37</sup>The members thought he had drawn a line. I know that because I have heard many members of the Church say, "Oh, we can watch that movie. It's only a PG-13. The prophet gave us permission." They don't say that last part, but that is what they are thinking, because they thought he posted a speed limit, so to speak.<br><br>But what would a movie given an R rating in 1986 be rated today? Would you agree that Hollywood has relaxed its standards? It is referred to as "ratings creep." Hollywood has gradually allowed more vulgarity, profanity, nudity, violence, sex, etc., over the decades while maintaining the same ratings. Does the word<i>creep</i>remind you of "the serpent [that] was more subtle than any beast of the field," as we read in both the book of Moses and Genesis?<sup>38</sup>Well, you don't need a study to verify the reality of ratings creep. If you are unaware of this creeping phenomenon, it is likely good evidence that you have become desensitized yourself to this dangerous trend and are in a pot of water with the temperature on the rise.<br><br>The cunning result of this creeping trend is that the 1986 R-rated movie has deceptively become a PG-13 or PG movie in 2013. The shifting or creeping of the line could be compared to the mists in Lehi's dream that "blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost."<sup>39</sup>As members justify the viewing of such movies based upon a deceptive rating, they become more and more desensitized to inappropriate material that a prophet identified as dangerous back in 1986. Those so deceived are pacified and lulled into Satan's territory; hence this warning in<i>For the Strength of Youth:</i>"Take care that your use of media does not dull your sensitivity to the Spirit."<sup>40</sup><br><br>If "virtue [is to] garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly,"<sup>41</sup>then as we pray in faith to avoid temptation, we especially need to be watchful and on guard with today's media, whether on TV or online, as it is perhaps the greatest spoiler of virtuous thinking. The movie rating or principle we should use is from the thirteenth article of faith: "We seek after"--or in this case "watch or view"--that which is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy." The Holy Ghost should be our Internet, movie, and TV guide.<br><h2><strong>Dating</strong></h2><br>Let's shift the spectrum we are considering from movies to dating. This time we will let my far right represent holding hands and my far left represent fornication. Between these two extremes, where do we draw the line over which we should not cross? For example, can a young man and a young woman kiss? I'm sure there are many in the audience who are thinking, "I sure hope so!" I'm not going to answer this question with a line but rather with a principle from<i>For the Strength of Youth:</i>"Do not do anything . . . that arouses sexual feelings."<sup>42</sup><br><br>When my oldest daughter was dating, I taught her this same principle in this way: "When a person does anything on purpose, outside the bonds of marriage, to sexually arouse another person, he or she is crossing over a line into sacred territory."<br><br>She said, "Dad, that can't be entirely true, because a man may see a beautiful woman walking down the street and become aroused."<br><br>I responded, "But did she do anything on purpose to arouse him? If she was dressed modestly, she didn't do anything wrong. But if she was dressed immodestly, then she crossed over the line in the way she dressed."<br><br>When you ponder on this principle, you will realize that a person can cross over that sacred line in the way they dress, in their conversation, in the way they dance, and clearly in the way they act and touch each other.<br><br>With this principle in mind, let me return to the question of kissing. Can a young man and a young woman kiss? Well, the correct answer to that question is "It depends."<br><br><i>For the Strength of Youth</i>cautions young people to "not participate in passionate kissing."<sup>43</sup>Why? Because passionate kissing puts the chocolate chip cookie in your hand--warm and moist and smelling good, and your body begins to prepare itself for the cookie. You are no longer simply fighting temptation but also fighting some powerful body chemistry and inviting temptation, not avoiding it. That kind of kissing should be reserved for marriage.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said, "Even if timely courtship justifies the kiss, it should be a clean, decent, sexless one."<sup>44</sup>Did you notice that President Kimball used the singular form of the word<i>kiss?</i>Kiss-<i>es,</i>the plural form, will likely violate the principle we just learned of beginning to "arouse" each other.<br><br>To help you keep the spirit of President Kimball's counsel, let me also add that it should be a brief kiss when courting, as a prolonged kiss will also shift your body's chemistry into high gear.<br><h2><strong>Trust--The Best Wedding Gift</strong></h2><br>Many years ago, while I was serving as a bishop, I had one of my beautiful Laurels come into the bishop's office to let me know that she and her boyfriend had been nibbling on the cookies--meaning passionate kissing--which had escalated to eating the entire cookie. During the conversation she said, "But Bishop, we are going to get married."<br><br>I said, "If it is true that you are going to get married, you have demonstrated to each other that you aren't wise enough to avoid nor strong enough to resist the cookies. You have demonstrated to each other that you can't fully trust each other."<br><br>After marriage, when life has become routine and less glamorous than during courtship, will you be able to fully trust your husband when an attractive woman at work or elsewhere--not a chocolate chip cookie this time but a cute little snickerdoodle--starts flirting with him? What will your level of trust be in him when he has demonstrated to you his weakness with cookies?<br><br>And will he be able to fully trust you when life becomes a little humdrum, you are feeling neglected by your husband, and some other man begins to make you feel important and shows interest in you? Not a chocolate chip cookie this time, but a white-chocolate-chunk macadamia cookie?<br><br>The best wedding gift you can give your future spouse is the gift of trust, a gift given by covenant at the altar in the temple but created as you mutually demonstrate respect, loyalty, and strength of character with each other during courtship. For a marriage that did not begin with this priceless gift, the trust can be earned, but only through sincere repentance. It will also take some time, as trust is built on demonstrated behavior as evidence of the truly penitent.<br><br>To help you develop the gift of trust during courtship,<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>shares the following<i>avoid</i>principles:<br><br><i>Choose to date only those who have high moral standards and in whose company you can maintain your standards. Remember that a young man and a young woman on a date are responsible to protect each other's honor and virtue.</i><sup>45</sup><br><br><i>Go only to places where you can maintain your standards and remain close to the Spirit.</i><sup>46</sup><br><br><i>When you begin dating, go with one or more additional couples.</i><sup>47</sup><br><br>All of these wise principles will help you<i>avoid</i>tempting situations.<br><h2><strong>Resisting</strong></h2><br>Avoiding temptation should be our first line of defense. However, we live in a world in which the wheat is growing together with the tares and in which it is impossible to completely avoid temptation. But it would be wise to minimize it to the extent possible.<br><br>When we are faced with temptation, we should resist it with an avoidance mentality. "Get thee behind me"<sup>48</sup>was the Savior's example of resisting with an avoidance mentality. "He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them."<sup>49</sup>When we are faced with temptation, it would be wise to follow the Savior's example by dismissing Satan without any further argument or discussion--immediately and swiftly. Joseph fleeing from the rapacious arms of Potiphar's wife is another good example of this principle.<br><h2><strong>The Savior's Grace and Repentance</strong></h2><br>There may be some here who have nibbled on or yielded completely to the "cookies," speaking metaphorically. If that includes you, please see your bishop. He loves you and will help you through the repentance process. It would be my hope that you would leave his office feeling the love of the Savior through him and the hope, happiness, and forgiveness that come from the Savior's grace to those who truly repent.<br><br>Whatever your weakness or temptation is--and we all have them--if your desire is to avoid that temptation in the future, remember that the Savior wants to help you. As noted under<i>grace</i>in the Guide to the Scriptures, His grace is a divine source of "help or strength [that] is given through the mercy and love of God. Every mortal person needs divine grace because of Adam's fall and also because of man's weaknesses." He understands what we are dealing with, as this scripture teaches: "Jesus Christ . . . knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted."<sup>50</sup>And how does He know how to succor those who are tempted? Because "he himself hath suffered being tempted, [therefore] he is able to succour them that are tempted."<sup>51</sup><br><br>Alma the Younger is one who was referred to as "very wicked"<sup>52</sup>and, along with the sons of Mosiah, as the "vilest of sinners."<sup>53</sup>Unlike the Savior, who never paid heed to temptation, Alma had. After repenting of his sins, Alma described the incredible clean feeling that came to him through the Savior's love and grace: "There can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy."<sup>54</sup><br><br>Because he knew what it was like to face temptation and succumb, Alma gave his own "avoid-it" or "watch-and-pray" advice to those who are in a similar situation:<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</i><br><br><i>But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and<b>watch and pray continually,</b>that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear.</i><sup>55</sup><br><br>My parting prayer is similar: that the Lord will bless each of you with the same wisdom with which he blessed Solomon; help you avoid temptation rather than trying to resist it; and give you the strength to quickly dismiss temptation in those situations in which it is impossible to completely avoid it, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i><i>Lynn G.

<h1>y Did Fellowship One with Another” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a preface to my remarks today, I wish to declare my faith and testimony. I know that there is a God in heaven. He is our Heavenly Father, and He loves all of His children. He has revealed Himself to the world in these the latter days, and prophets walk the earth today as they did anciently.<br><br><i>God loved us, so he sent his Son,<br>Christ Jesus, the atoning One,<br>To show us by the path he trod<br>The one and only way to God.</i><br>["God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 187]<br><br>I rejoice with you today in this good news and in this truth.<br><h2><strong>"Lonely in the Midst of a Million"</strong></h2><br>During the past several years my wife, Carol, and I have been fortunate to live with you here in "Happy Valley." I consider this a great blessing for us and our family. But I have discovered that even in Happy Valley there are some among us who are not happy and who yearn for recognition and friendship. I find this odd because we live in an environment of relative tranquility and abundance. During an earlier era of peace and plenty described in the Book of Mormon, it was noted: "And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy" (Helaman 6:3). As we fellowship or befriend others, we can also rejoice with them and have great joy.<br><br>I have seen this outcome in many of your lives, but not all. There are lonely people among us, and today I share your concern for such souls. Perhaps you are among the lonely. Surely some of those within your reach sense the emptiness of feeling alone in the world. Moroni had such feelings when he wrote, "I am alone . . . , and I have not friends" (Mormon 8:5). But his world was devoid of Saints. In Provo we are surrounded!<br><br>In 1867 Mark Twain visited New York City and reported the following: "[New York] is a splendid desert--a domed and steepled solitude, where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race" ("Letter from 'Mark Twain,'" San Francisco<i>Daily Alta California,</i>11 August 1867, 1). How sad that lonely souls walked the same streets as thousands of other lonely persons--their potential friends. This is contrary to the way God would have us live. He desires that we be "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens" (Ephesians 2:19).<br><br>Today there are still lonely people in New York City as well as throughout the world. Listen to a sampling of their voices:<br><br><i>"I always feel lonely and have no friends."</i><br><br><i>"I'm not important to anyone. I'm forgettable. I'm boring."</i><br><br><i>"I am so lonely. . . . Please just talk to me."</i>["I Am Lonely," experienceproject.com]<br><br>Or consider the words of a woman who recently visited a beautiful park. Excited to make new friends that day, she noted:<br><br><i>I passed at least 20 adults, some with children, some with dogs on leashes. The dogs appeared to be excited, tails wagging, stopping to take a sniff at anyone who acknowledged them. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . No one smiles, no one can say hi, and if you try to say hi to them, they turn their heads. . . . Maybe some owners could learn a lesson or two from their furry companions.</i><br><br>The park visitor concluded, "If you don't extend your hand out to others, there won't be anyone to miss you when you are gone" (LifebyLisa, "Short Stories: Loneliness," 10 August 2007, beyondprose.com/index.php/short-stories-loneliness-33-287448).<br><br>Let me briefly add a personal disclaimer. Today's advice is not intended to encourage anyone to disregard common sense when dealing with others. Certainly there are rare situations that necessitate avoiding people. Scripture warns, "Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away" (Proverbs 4:14–15). However, to personally extend this biblical warning unnecessarily to multitudes of well-meaning but lonely people is to forfeit opportunities to bless lives--yours included.<br><h2><strong>Get Outside Yourself</strong></h2><br>Not long ago a sophomore at BYU found her way to my office. Her demeanor and body language bespoke her sadness, and she lamented that she had failed to become involved or make many friends during her first year in Provo. I mostly listened as she conducted a personal therapy session with herself and as she concluded, saying, "I guess I just need to get outside myself and do something for others." She had made a very wise and absolutely correct diagnosis of the malady from which she was suffering, and I knew I could help.<br><br>I immediately walked the young woman to the Student Leadership office, which houses the programs of the Brigham Young University Student Service Association, or BYUSA as it is better known. There she was introduced to a genuinely happy and gregarious student volunteer who took her on a tour of the office, explaining the various ways in which students may become involved and serve others. I left knowing that my young friend was in good hands. She was doing what she herself had prescribed. She was getting outside herself and finding ways to serve others.<br><br>A few days after our visit to the Student Leadership office, I returned to communicate thanks to the dedicated student volunteer who had fellowshipped my friend. The volunteer said, with excitement in her voice, "Your friend is here in the office this afternoon."<br><br>"Where?" I questioned.<br><br>"Over there." She pointed to a spot perhaps fifty feet from where we stood. I quickly made my way to see my once lonely and unhappy friend but opted to stay out of sight while within range of her voice. My friend had gotten involved and was giving a tour of the office to two freshmen.<br><br>I heard her say, "I didn't get involved but kept to myself during my freshman year, and I regret it. You need to get outside yourself and find a way to serve. We can help you!" This was music to my ears, and when I made my appearance I observed the smile that had replaced the previous distressed look on my friend's face. Similar excited and happy looks were observed on the faces of the two visitors. I had just witnessed modern fulfillment of the important Book of Mormon parallel: "And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy."<br><br>Professor Richard J. Light, in his groundbreaking research regarding college students, observed, "Students report that their most powerful memories come from incidents and experiences outside of classes, usually during interactions with fellow students" (Making the Most of College: Students Speak Their Minds [Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001], 210). I would add that campus clubs, the Y-Serve office, and Student Leadership programs at BYU are wonderful ways to find service opportunities and thus have positive interactions with other students. If you feel such a need, these programs beckon you! Please find a way to contribute and get outside yourself. If you are concerned that involvement may adversely impact your academics, Dr. Light concluded, "On average, students who do volunteer work have slightly higher grades than those who don't" (<i>Making the Most of College,</i>29).<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson visited the BYU campus in 2007. He observed that day:<br><br><i>To find real happiness, we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves. No one has learned the meaning of living until he has surrendered his ego to the service of his fellow man. Service to others is akin to duty--the fulfillment of which brings true joy.</i>[<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson_guideposts-lifes-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Guideposts for Life's Journey</a>," BYU devotional address, 13 November 2007]<br><br>I testify that this is true and rejoice in the many students who have discovered this emancipating principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. President Monson also observed, "The New Testament teaches that it is impossible to take a right attitude toward Christ without taking an unselfish attitude toward men" ("Guideposts"). President Monson's encouragement and his personal example are echoes of a principle taught in the Book of Mormon: "Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all" (Jacob 2:17).<br><h2><strong>Have Courage to Approach Others</strong></h2><br>Sister Cox and I were blessed to be able to serve the people of the Illinois Chicago Mission. It was a challenging but beautifully enlarging experience for our family. One of the things about which we felt strongly was the importance of quickly introducing new missionaries to the people of the Windy City. When missionaries first arrived, we did not attempt to insulate them from others. We wanted them to immediately meet people who would profit from knowing about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. This is our mission!<br><br>As new missionaries arrived at O'Hare Airport, it was our practice to board the "L" train with them for a forty-five-minute ride into the city. Armed with copies of the Book of Mormon and referral cards, our objective was to provide every new missionary a positive experience in sharing the gospel with someone along the way. A few seasoned missionaries accompanied us in order to provide good role models and mentors for the sincere but inexperienced elders and sisters. I loved those days, but I am not sure all of the new missionaries did!<br><br>Having been raised by loving mothers and fathers who had taught them to never speak to strangers, it must have seemed odd when we directed the new missionaries to speak with every stranger they could as they rode the train into the city. Many responded and greeted people on the train while others initially found it difficult to communicate with strangers.<br><br>I recall one wonderful sister who, upon her arrival, seemed frozen with fear as she contemplated how she might make a positive contact during her first day as a missionary in the field. Unable to muster the significant courage needed to initiate a conversation with others, she observed a group of young people boarding the train. They were touring the city and sharing their Christian beliefs through music. Thanks to the other missionaries, there was ample conversation about our faith on the train car, and the members of the Christian youth group were exposed to the Book of Mormon by enthusiastic elders and sisters. There was so much discussion, in fact, that we actually missed our intended stop, riding the train until we reached the line's terminus.<br><br>As this kind group of Christian youth and their pastor exited the train, the young sister missionary was gathering her things, not yet having had a chance to speak about her faith. One of the female members of the departing Christian youth group lagged behind her peers and quietly returned to the train car to ask the determined but somewhat frustrated sister missionary, "Could I get a copy of that book?" The sister missionary wasted no time in delivering a copy of the Book of Mormon before briefly bearing her humble testimony of its veracity. I don't think that this sister's feet touched the ground for hours after her positive interaction with a stranger. Her prayers--and ours--were answered.<br><br>Thinking about this young sister missionary brings back memories of my first few days as a young elder. Serving in Tokyo, Japan, with no previous language training, I participated many mornings in a flyer distribution activity at the Nishi Koiwa train station. As men hustled to board their train to go to work early each morning, we politely approached them and offered a small flyer detailing the location of our church and providing a brief spiritual message. As the men rapidly passed by, I learned to say, "Dozo, yonde kudasai," or "Please read this." After a few days of repeating the same simple directive, I asked my companion, Elder Kent McKell, if there might be another phrase I could use. He told me to say, "Dozo, oyomi ni natte kudasai," which means the same thing (please read this) but in honorific language. Iproceeded to use the newly discovered expression but unfortunately failed to pronounce one syllable correctly. That morning I repeated, perhaps 200 times, to busy Japanese businessmen, "Dozo, oyome ni natte kudasai," or "Please marry me" (literally, please become my bride). Yes, we risk failure or embarrassment when we approach others, but it is the right thing to do!<br><br>I am grateful today for a Church member who got outside himself and talked to a stranger. The stranger was my great-great-grandfather Orville Sutherland Cox, who was relocating from Ohio to Missouri. My ancestor was not well acquainted with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ when he met Brother Sylvester Hulet on a dusty road just outside Far West, Missouri, in 1838. Brother Hulet patiently listened as Mr. Cox harshly criticized the Church based solely on rumors to which he had been exposed. Rather than bristling and walking away, Brother Hulet invited my ancestor to walk with him into the city and witness, firsthand, the industry and goodness of the Mormons. My ancestor was impressed and quickly recognized the false nature of his previous impressions. Learning that Mr. Cox was a newcomer and had no place to stay, Brother Hulet kindly opened his home to this stranger for an extended period. For me this adds much personal meaning to the Savior's declaration "I was a stranger, and ye took me in" (Matthew 25:35).<br><br>That one encounter altered the entire course of my great-great-grandfather's life and the lives of his descendants. I am a grateful recipient of Brother Sylvester Hulet's kind fellowshipping that day so long ago. After some time Orville Cox was baptized, and the two men eventually migrated to Utah and remained faithful Latter-day Saints and best friends to the end of their lives. It is only fitting that Orville Sutherland Cox and Sylvester Hulet, who met as strangers on a road in Missouri, are buried next to each other in the pioneer cemetery in Fairview, Utah. What if Brother Hulet would have avoided my ancestor that day? It is quite possible that we would not be having this conversation 175 years later!<br><h2><strong>Show Genuine Interest: Three Examples</strong></h2><br>All of us are looking forward to general conference this coming weekend, and we see genuine interest in others powerfully exemplified in the lives of our Church leaders. While I am not well acquainted with the Brethren and regard myself as a very ordinary but grateful Church member, I have had occasion to personally witness the determined efforts of Church leaders to get outside themselves and recognize others.<br><br>Years ago as a missionary I looked forward to a visit of the relatively young apostle Elder Gordon B. Hinckley. He was deeply revered by the Japanese Saints and had been highly involved in the growth of the Church in post–World War II Japan. He loved all people but seemed to have a special affinity for those in this once war-torn nation.<br><br>Elder Hinckley arrived late one evening, very tired and suffering from jet lag. The following day he faced a rigorous schedule, which included much travel and several teaching opportunities. As he arose very early the next morning, he had every reason to seek privacy as he prepared for the day, but that was not what he chose to do. Elder Hinckley asked the first missionaries he encountered that morning--Elders Evans and Cox--if they would accompany him into the streets of Tokyo, where he desired to communicate with the good people of that city. Although he spoke a surprising amount of Japanese, he felt that the two missionaries might be of some value in helping him communicate with those he would meet that morning. We spent the next hour contacting people on the streets of Tokyo, recognizing them and their individual worth and informing them of our faith. President Hinckley loved all people and sought to serve them throughout his long life. He did not avoid others!<br><br>On another occasion I visited a Salt Lake clinic seeking remedy for a knee injury. When my name was called, I was ushered down a busy hallway by a helpful nurse. While moving toward our destination, we passed an exam room with an open door. Seated on the exam table, dressed in a hospital gown, was President Spencer W. Kimball, who was also receiving medical attention that day. I was shocked to see the prophet but inspired when he quickly recognized my presence and waved a kind greeting to a man he had never met but one he seemed to value. Such is the manner in which true disciples of Christ live.<br><br>You perhaps have noticed, as I have, how prone to warmth and welcoming our university president is. When I visited campus in fall 2007 to be interviewed for the position I was later blessed to assume, I was walking alone from the Abraham Smoot Building to the Wilkinson Student Center when President Cecil O. Samuelson, accompanied by a few of his colleagues, greeted me while walking in the opposite direction. He was one of very few who seemed to recognize me that day. Why did he notice me? He did not know me, and I was not affiliated with the university at the time. He had nothing to gain from his brief but genial exchange with me. He simply cares about others in a manner not unlike the Savior, who issues a sincere greeting and invitation to all mankind: "My hands are stretched out still" (see Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21).<br><h2><strong>Look for Ways to Be with Others</strong></h2><br>So why is it so difficult for us to talk to others we don't yet know? Perhaps it is because not everyone returns the same enthusiastic greeting we try to extend. The actions of many bespeak their apparent belief that eye contact has been outlawed in Provo. Others hide behind an electronic shield, a hindrance to potential contact that would enhance their lives and bring blessings to themselves and others. Too many on our campus spend time inspecting the sidewalks rather than looking up to find the potential friends who surround them. Some of us leave behind the strong focus on the welfare of others we practiced as missionaries. This campus should be the warmest and most inviting on earth!<br><br>You have likely felt both the exhilaration of being recognized as well as the heartache that accompanies being ignored. Let us choose to recognize others on the campus of Brigham Young University. Let us follow the counsel given by outstanding student leaders who, sensing the need I speak of today, produced a brief video in 2008 that is timeless and worth our viewing this morning (see<i>Redefine Service,</i>BYUSA video, byusa.byu.edu/service/redefine-service).<br><br>Stephen R. Covey left us a ringing reminder of the principle I am attempting to define today when he wrote, "Ironically, you'll find that as you care less about what others think of you, you will care more about what others think of themselves and their worlds, including their relationship with you" (<i>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People: Restoring the Character Ethic</i>[New York: Free Press, 2004], 61).<br><br><i>The world can be a frightening place.</i><br><i>Not everyone will heed you.</i><br><i>Don't hide yourself away from folks.</i><br><i>Put others first; they need you.</i><br><br><i>As others you approach each day,</i><br><i>Recall the social dearth</i><br><i>That's swept the earth and hampered souls.</i><br><i>But souls have such great worth.</i><br><br><i>Please notice those around you, and</i><br><i>Take time to look and see</i><br><i>The precious ones right in your path.</i><br><i>Your friends they soon may be!</i><br><br><i>Those starving for the human touch</i><br><i>That Saints should always grant.</i><br><i>You'll make the world a better place,</i><br><i>So please, don't say, "I can't."</i><br><br><i>Surrender all your ego and</i><br><i>Put focus on the others</i><br><i>Who pass you daily on your way--</i><br><i>Your heavenly kin, your brothers.</i><br><br><i>Remember those who took the time</i><br><i>To recognize and greet you?</i><br><i>Then pass it on and do your best;</i><br><i>Give folks a chance to meet you.</i><br><br><i>The world can be a happier place;</i><br><i>More friends you're making too.</i><br><i>Extend yourself and bless a life.</i><br><i>It all begins with you.</i><br><br>During His earthly ministry the Savior noted, "I . . . know my sheep" (John 10:14). Shouldn't we then know each other? This cannot fully occur until we take time for others and recognize both their existence and worth. Of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus it is written, "And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them" (Luke 24:15). The Savior looked for ways to be with others. Let us not avoid such opportunity. As the hymn advises,<br><br><i>Let's oft, then, in kindly toned voices,<br>Our mutual friendship renew,<br>Till heart meets with heart and rejoices<br>In friendship that ever is true.</i><br>["Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words,"<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 232]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, "Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism'" (<i>HC</i>5:517). Let us better open this campus to fellowshipping so that it may someday also be said of us, "And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy." This is my sincere and humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neal LaVaun Cox was associate dean of students at BYU when this devotional address was given on 1 October 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Desires Your Success - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. It is an honor to stand before you this day, and it is an honor to teach at this great university. I have long pondered the message I would share today, and I have looked forward to this day with apprehension--praying that I will say those things that will be of most benefit to you. This opportunity to speak to you has been overwhelming and humbling, to say the least, and I have taken courage from the words of King David to his son Solomon in 1 Chronicles 28:20:<br><br><i>Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.</i><br><h2><strong>Knowledge and Intelligence</strong></h2><br>I love coming to campus each fall. I can feel of your knowledge and intelligence--I find it invigorating. In Doctrine and Covenants 93:30 we read, "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence." In Doctrine and Covenants 93:36 the Lord clarifies the meaning of intelligence: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." We have been instructed in Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." What does this mean for you and me? In my mind this translates to my being diligent in pursuing knowledge and being obedient in applying my learning to righteous purposes as I exercise faith.<br><br>President Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>We . . . keep learning, and we do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information. That may appear a strange idea to some; but it is for the plain and simple reason that we are not capacitated to receive all knowledge at once. We must therefore receive a little here and a little there.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In other words, the work of knowledge and, subsequently, intelligence is developmental and ongoing throughout our lives. We begin our learning as an infant, and personal development is ongoing.<br><br>One of my favorite growth and development theories comes from a well-known psychologist, Erik Erikson. Dr. Erikson maintains that an individual's development occurs throughout the span of life. He outlined a theory known as the eight stages of psychosocial development. This is a theory that I have found enlightening, especially considering our understanding that Heavenly Father's plan for us is developmental. I have implemented aspects of this theory into my daily interactions, not only as a professional but also as a wife, mother, friend, daughter, and neighbor.<br><br>According to Erikson, during the course of our lifetime, each one of us moves through specific stages of development that are framed with opposing core conflicts. He proposed that each conflict must be successfully mastered before progressing to the next stage. Speaking very simplistically, as we successfully resolve each stage of development conflict, we are prepared to move forward to the next phase. Each phase of development builds upon the prior stage. The stages of development are as follows:<br><br>Trust vs. Mistrust (birth to 1 year)<br>Autonomy vs. Sense of Shame/Doubt (1–3 years)<br>Initiative vs. Guilt (3–6 years)<br>Industry vs. Inferiority (6–11 years)<br>Identity vs. Role Confusion (puberty)<br>Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adult)<br>Generativity vs. Self-Absorption and Stagnation (middle age)<br>Ego Integrity vs. Despair (old age)<sup>2</sup><br><br>Resolving the conflict of each stage of development is progressive, although the conflict is not always mastered during the specific stage suggested and may be returned to later in life for resolution.<br><br>As I look back at my own personal growth and development and acquisition of knowledge and intelligence, I can see light, truth, and faith guiding my progression through each stage. I would like to share with you a few educational insights I have gained as I have moved through some of the stages of development and learned, as suggested by Elder Bruce C. Hafen, "line upon line, step by step, grace for grace."<sup>3</sup><br><h2><strong>Engage Your Mind</strong></h2><br>The stage of Industry vs. Inferiority is a time of work and productivity. We begin school and we start to think more independently. When I was a young girl in this stage, my father--an engineer--would encourage me to think logically and to reason. "Use your brain," he would say as he encouraged me to seek knowledge and additional understanding in all areas of my life. He taught me to reason and to think critically. He taught me to seek for light and truth in both the academic and spiritual realms. For many years I did not truly understand the context of his comment, but over time I grew to recognize the beauty of knowledge and intelligence, the empowerment of education, and the importance of spiritual faith coupled with secular learning.<br><h2><strong>Be a Better Person</strong></h2><br>The conflict of Identity vs. Role Confusion during our teenage years is difficult for many. During this time we incorporate our personal beliefs with those of society and begin to make decisions about the future. When I was a teen, I would occasionally defy my parents' suggestions regarding my performance in life. I remember very distinctly being frustrated with my mother one day as she proposed recommendations for my future. As my mother was advising me, I angrily turned and began to walk away--and then I heard her quietly comment, "I only want you to be a better person than I am." My heart immediately softened, and I wondered how anyone could possibly be better than my own dear mother. I have since apologized for my behavior, but her comment (or rather her challenge to me to be a better person) has stayed with me throughout my life. As a teen, and even now, that challenge has motivated me to be a better person--it taught me the importance of applying my learning.<br><br>As a result of my parents' teachings during the first stages of development, I set goals for my life--goals for my future family, goals regarding my education, and goals for my spiritual growth. I feel that when goals are combined with faith and reason, they empower us throughout all life stages as we seek to resolve many of these developmental conflicts. Goals enable us to engage our minds in righteous endeavors and motivate us to be better people. Even President Gordon B. Hinckley, at age ninety-two, set goals to be a better person:<br><br><i>I, for one, have made a stronger resolution within myself to be a better person than I have been in the past. I hope that I will be a little kinder to any I meet who may be in distress. I hope that I will be a little more helpful to those who are in need. I hope that I will be a little more worthy of your confidence. I hope that I will be a better husband, a better father and grandfather. I hope that I will be a better neighbor and friend. I hope that I will be a better Latter-day Saint, with an increased understanding of the wonderful aspects of this glorious gospel.</i><sup>4</sup><br><h2><strong>Follow Righteous Goals</strong></h2><br>After graduating from high school (during the stage of Intimacy vs. Isolation), I registered at a university and joined the gymnastics team. I created an impressive routine on the uneven parallel bars and achieved some success in competition. Just prior to the regional meet I decided to change the final maneuver of my routine. As the first competitor from our team, I felt confident that the change I had made would result in a winning routine, and I anticipated an extremely positive outcome.<br><br>My performance, however, was anything but satisfactory, as I fell from the bars with every maneuver I attempted. After completing the routine, I walked from the apparatus in absolute humiliation and disgust. I could not look my teammates nor my coach in the eye. As I tearfully made my way past my coach, his only comment was, "I never should have let you change the ending of your routine."<br><br>I have often pondered his comment and the devastating impact the change in my final maneuver had upon my performance and that of my peers. In spite of hard work and dedicated preparation, the other members of the team felt my discouragement and loss of vision. They also performed substandard routines.<br><br>I learned a few things from this experience. In my mind, the maneuvers of my routine represent the implementation of my goals, the final maneuver embodies the personal vision of where I am going in life, and the outcome is dependent upon my performance. It reminds me of the importance of setting righteous goals in life and not giving up--even during trials. It reminds me of the value of having a sound vision of where we are going and the importance of recognizing the influence we have upon each other.<br><br>I think about this experience often when reviewing my goals for life. My ponderings about my experience on the gymnastics team solidified my determination to attain goals that will lead me to a righteous end in my life's journey. Setting righteous goals early in life has provided positive direction for my spiritual and academic learning. In a timeless address, Elder M. Russell Ballard said:<br><br><i>I believe you can train yourself to become a positive thinker, but you must cultivate a desire to develop the skill of setting personal worthy and realistic goals. I am so thoroughly convinced that if we don't set goals in our life and learn how to master the technique of living to reach our goals, we can reach a ripe old age and look back on our life only to see that we reached but a small part of our full potential. When you learn to master the principle of setting a goal, you will then be able to make a great difference in the results you attain in this life.</i><br><br>He then instructed us:<br><br><i>If your goals are righteous, of God-given perspective, eternal in their nature, then go for them. Pray for the inner strength to have the discipline to do those things that will guarantee through your activity and your life that you will reach your goals. Then, I think, perhaps as important as anything, we have to have faith. We have to have faith in God. We have to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And oh, how desperately we have to have faith in ourselves.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>How important it is to trust in yourself--to have faith that you can complete your goals. What are your goals in life? You are here at this extraordinary university; it is evident that you have set educational goals. Hopefully you have also set spiritual goals as well as goals for family and service as you seek light and truth and apply the knowledge and intelligence you are attaining.<br><h2><strong>Trust in the Lord</strong></h2><br>I have found that my spiritual goals and my educational goals complement each other and have provided strength to overcome many of the vicissitudes of life. I have learned to trust in the Lord as I pursue my goals. My educational journey and my journey in life have not been without challenges. In fact, there are those who wonder why I have continued to pursue my education when considering the tests of life. Some of my greatest challenges were encountered while I was a single mother. For twenty-five years I raised my children alone. This "adventure," however, did not deter me from my goals of raising a righteous family, seeking for spiritual learning, and continuing my education.<br><br>I remember feeling very old when I returned to school, then in the stage of Generativity vs. Stagnation. I had been a registered nurse for fourteen years, and my youngest child was sixteen years old. But the prompting to return to school was so strong that I knew I should continue. Even so, I completed a few courses online before I was brave enough to enter the traditional classroom.<br><br>The very first day of class I knew that I would never survive this journey without a friend. So when I returned home that night and knelt in prayer, I prayed for a good friend. The next week, when I returned to class, there was another "more mature" woman sitting in the back. I knew when I met her that my prayer had been answered. Jane and I became steadfast friends. To this day we continue to support each other through various life challenges.<br><br>Our friendship has strengthened my faith that our Heavenly Father is aware of our goals and is involved in the details of our lives. It has also made me aware of the importance of having a good friend as you pursue your goals in life. Because of my friendship with Jane, I began to pray each day that my children--and now also my grandchildren--would each find a good friend and then be a good friend. When I came to teach at BYU, I extended my prayer to each of you. Sometimes I even say a quiet prayer as I walk across campus and notice a student who looks like they could use a good friend. Hopefully my prayers have been answered in your behalf. I hope that you will join me in my prayer that you will each find a good friend and be a good friend.<br><h2><strong>Go Forward with Faith</strong></h2><br>One evening following a long day's work at the hospital, I entered the BYU Salt Lake Center to attend a graduate-level course. On this particular evening I was very tired, and I chose to take the elevator to class rather than carry my very large and heavy backpack of books up the stairs. As I stood waiting for the elevator I commiserated: I was tired, and I wondered if this goal of advanced education was worth it. I knew that it would open new doors in employment but that it would not change my financial income. I thought, "What on earth were you thinking when you returned to school?" As I considered my motives, I glanced to the side and noticed the words "Enter to learn; go forth to serve," and I knew immediately that my education would help me obtain new light and truth and make available opportunities of faithful service that I had not previously contemplated.<br><br>I love the motto of Brigham Young University. It provided guidance as I completed my education, and it continues to guide my service today. Elder David H. Bednar offered insight regarding our motto:<br><br><i>On the landmark sign located at the entrance to Brigham Young University, the following motto is found: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." This expression certainly does not imply that everything necessary for a lifetime of meaningful service can or will be obtained during a few short years of higher education. Rather, the spirit of this statement is that students come to receive foundational instruction about learning how to learn and learning to love learning. Furthermore, students' desires and capacities to serve are not "put on hold" during their university years of intellectual exploration and development.</i><br><br><i>May I respectfully suggest an addition to this well-known motto that is too long to put on the sign but important for us to remember regardless of which university or college we attend: "Enter to learn to love learning and serving; go forth to continue learning and serving.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had to advance my education. It is my continual prayer that I will recognize opportunities of service that will enable me to share my education and my testimony of the gospel.<br><br>In a lecture given to students in the BYU Honors Program, James S. Jardine suggested that "we have a prescribed duty to develop the gifts and talents, including intellectual gifts, bestowed on us by God."<sup>7</sup>He then said that in order to consecrate our intellectual gifts, we must first develop them, and that "our consecrated learning enables us more completely to comfort those who stand in need of comfort--whether they are learned or uneducated, successful or downtrodden, gracious or difficult."<sup>8</sup><br><h2><strong>Consecrate Learning</strong></h2><br>Shortly after completing my master's degree I contemplated returning once again to further my education with a doctorate degree. I began preparing applications to doctoral programs and fasted and prayed that I would know which course would be best for me to take. The answer to my prayers came in the form of the still, small voice whispering that a doctoral degree was not needed for the next service I would be asked to provide. I withheld my doctoral applications with the exception of one that was already submitted. The Spirit then came even stronger--indicating that a doctoral degree would not be needed for the service I would provide next. The prompting came so strongly that I began to pray that I would not be accepted. I was not accepted into the graduate program, although my friend Jane was. It was a bittersweet experience, and yet we both went forward in faith.<br><br>A few short months later I received the calling to serve as one of the Relief Society presidents at the Utah State Prison. It was a deeply spiritual experience and a unique opportunity that required me to serve with all of my "heart, might, mind and strength" (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2). Serving in this position continually reminded me of our divine heritage and the love that our Heavenly Father has for us. On the first Sunday that I attended meetings at the prison, the Spirit bore witness to me that I had been prepared to serve in this calling. I had been prepared spiritually, educationally, and by unique life experiences.<br><br>One of my responsibilities as the Relief Society president was to evaluate the needs of the women attending our meetings. I would meet with each woman individually and discuss her life goals and physical needs as she worked toward her release. Then, just prior to her release, I would prepare orders for clothing and personal items. I generally would deliver the needed items to a halfway house late in the afternoon; however, one morning I delivered the items early--prior to coming to campus for class. On my way to campus my thoughts focused on the challenges and struggles these women faced, the strength each of us needs to overcome adversity, and the empowerment of education.<br><br>My thoughts were heavy that day as I pondered how to best meet the needs of the women I was serving. As I arrived on campus and parked, I also began to contemplate the needs of the students in my class. Just as I stepped across the classroom threshold, the still, small voice whispered that there were students in my class that day who had also experienced unhappy struggles in life and were seeking to improve themselves through education. And I paused--for the Spirit bore witness that I teach among spiritual giants and dearly beloved children of our Heavenly Father. I was reminded once again of the spiritual gifts offered to each of God's children, the power of the Atonement, the importance of setting wise goals in all areas of our lives, and the empowerment of education.<br><h2><strong>The Lord Desires Your Success</strong></h2><br>My educational journey did not end with my calling as a Relief Society president. Rather, it has continued throughout my life. President Henry B. Eyring has instructed us:<br><br><i>No service that matters can be given over a lifetime by those who stop learning. A great teacher is always studying. A nurse never stops facing the challenge of dealing with something new, be it equipment or procedure. And the workplace in every industry is changing so rapidly that what we know today will not be enough for tomorrow.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>My real-life education continues to this day; I am constantly studying for my professional service and for my family, community, and Church service. In May of this year I graduated one more time--this time with my doctor of nursing practice degree. It represented the fulfillment of one more goal. The Lord had not forgotten. I had the honor of graduating with my sister, who had taken the past nine years to complete her bachelor's degree in business. It was a great honor for both of us as we completed our educational goals. We are blessed to have families who have supported us and rejoiced in our educational achievements. We are grateful for a Heavenly Father who recognized our goals and blessed us with the fortitude to continue our education.<br><br>I have not yet reached the final stage of development. However, for nearly twelve years I cared for a great-aunt as she progressed through the stage of Ego Integrity vs. Despair. Some days were more difficult than others for Aunt Beth, especially as she neared the end of her life. One evening after a particularly trying day, Beth and I talked about some of our life journeys and contemplated together the plan of happiness that the Lord has provided for us. At the end of our conversation, Beth took my hand and said, "Life is good, Peggy. Life is good." She looked at the past with peace and satisfaction--mastery of the conflict.<br><br>Throughout my life I have received priesthood blessings to help me as I worked toward my goals of education and service. While serving in my calling at the prison I received a blessing that opened my eyes of understanding about our relationship with our Heavenly Father, the respect He has for our righteous goals, and the deep love He has for each one of us. I don't usually share personal blessings, but I feel that this blessing was meant to be shared.<br><br>On the day that I received this blessing, the stake presidency of the sponsoring stake at the prison was visiting our meetings. All of the women who wanted blessings had received them. I was then asked by a member of the stake presidency if I would like a priesthood blessing. At the beginning of the blessing the counselor giving the blessing thanked me for my service. Then he paused and said the following: "The Lord desires your success. He desires your success in all aspects of your life--in your profession, in your education, in your family, in your relationships. The Lord desires your success."<br><br>It empowers me when I realize that the Lord desires my success. It motivates me to engage my mind in education and righteous activities, to be a better person, to set righteous goals, to be a good friend, to consecrate my learning, and to go forward with faith. My friends, I bear my testimony that I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that They know and love each one of us. I bear my testimony that They know your goals and They desire your success--in your education, in your profession, in your service, in your families, and in your relationships. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy H.

<h1> a Work of Art - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for the privilege to be with you today. It is a great opportunity to speak to a very special and unique group of people like you.<br><br>It is truly a blessing to study at this university, a place that allows each of you to live according to your beliefs. Not all students in the world have this opportunity.<br><br>When I was your age, I studied at a respected university in São Paulo, Brazil--in the city in which I was born and raised. It was a good institution of higher education, but it didn't have an environment as healthy as what you have here. It didn't have the wonderful support structure that BYU has. Furthermore, it didn't have a single other student who shared the same principles of the gospel that I had. To the contrary, I had many peers who tried to influence me in a direction that was different from where I wanted to go. So I can assure you that you are truly very blessed to have this privilege. Enjoy it.<br><br>I am certain you have already heard of Michelangelo, the Italian sculptor. Besides being a sculptor, he was a painter, a poet, and an architect, and he is considered one of the foremost artists of Western civilization during the period of the Renaissance to Mannerism. He was born in Italy in 1475, and he is known as a genius for his large marble statues. He lived in Italy most of his life and left an artistic legacy for humanity that is admired even today.<br><br>One of his most famous sculptures is called the<i>Pietà.</i>This statue portrays the scene of Mary, the mother of Jesus, seated with Jesus Christ, her son, laying in her arms after having been taken down from the cross. Mary's countenance expresses profound sadness for the suffering that she has experienced, and the face of Jesus expresses the suffering He had accumulated after having borne the arduous burden of taking upon Him the sins of the world and being nailed to the cross. It is a work of art that depicts the authenticity of the physical and emotional details of a scene of suffering.<br><br>I had the privilege of viewing this sculpture during a visit I made to Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. I was even more impressed to learn that Michelangelo used basically two main tools to accomplish his works of art: a hammer and a chisel. It is truly incredible to imagine how someone could create such an enormous and beautiful work of art from a piece of raw marble using these two tools. Certainly he was very talented and knew how to use the resources he had to produce such beautiful works of art.<br><br>When I think about the works he produced and the results he achieved, I think figuratively about the wonderful plan of love our Heavenly Father developed in consideration for each of us and for what He hoped we might become when He sent us here to earth.<br><br>Each of us was born with the potential to become like our Heavenly Father. Through our experiences and by properly using our agency, we can turn our lives in the direction of God and become like Him. Or we can be distracted by the world and fail to achieve our potential as it was promised to us. Figuratively, we all have the potential to become beautiful works of art in the Lord's hands. In this sense, He is the sculptor and He uses a hammer and chisel to mold us through our experiences day by day. If we allow the Lord to shape us, the result will be wonderful.<br><br>But without question, this world offers many distractions that can pull our focus away from the primary reason we are living here on this earth. These distractions can turn into detours in our lives that prevent us from being transformed into works of art. Let us examine how this happens.<br><br>Before speaking about this process, I wish to emphasize two principles. First, you need to know that you are a chosen generation; you were preordained by the Lord to be here on the earth during this period of history. The Lord reserved you for this time because He knew that you would be part of a group of special and strong spirits who could overcome the challenges of this era. Therefore, you are a special generation. I am certain that you have already heard this many times, but can you now see why?<br><br>Second, the enemy knows your potential and the promises made to you. He was in the ­presence of the Lord when this plan was presented. He knows exactly what the Lord expects for each of us. He doesn't have the veil of forgetfulness that we have while we live upon the earth. For this reason he works hard to distract our attention from our primary focus, trying to draw us away from the direction of the Lord.<br><br>Now, in talking about the process of distractions, I would like to refer to Lehi's vision about the tree of life. Remember that Lehi saw a tree "whose fruit was desirable to make one happy" (1 Nephi 8:10). He also saw a straight and narrow path alongside an iron rod that "extended along the bank of the river" and led to the field where the tree was located (1 Nephi 8:19–20). A dense mist of darkness covered the path leading to the tree of life. Because of this mist, several people who had started along the path to the tree of life wandered away from it and became lost (see 1 Nephi 8:22–23).<br><br>In 1 Nephi 12:17, Nephi explained that "the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost." Here we find the primary distraction in our lives: temptation. The Guide to the Scriptures defines temptation as "a test of a person's ability to choose good instead of evil; an enticement to sin and follow Satan instead of God."<br><br>Temptation is the primary weapon the enemy uses to distract us. According to the teachings of Nephi, temptation makes us blind, hardens our hearts, and causes us to perish. Generally speaking, temptation is very subtle. It comes to us undetected and deceives us. We are unable to see the consequences of it, and consequently we may make wrong choices. We become blind. We become prideful with a hardened heart, unreceptive to the will of God. The only weapon we have to avoid this distraction is to hold onto the iron rod. Nephi explained this to his brothers when they asked him about the meaning of the iron rod:<br><br><i>And I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</i>[1 Nephi 15:24–25]<br><br>I remember an experience that a young man went through during the years when he was in college. This young man was a good member of the Church. He told me that he was once invited to a costume party in the house of one of his classmates. Everyone was very excited to go to that particular party. The friend claimed that his college professors were also invited to attend, especially some of them who were very nice and friendly toward the students. All of this seemed very inviting and secure. So the young man accepted the invitation to go to the party. When he arrived there, he realized that the atmosphere was not exactly what he had expected. There were students drinking, smoking, using drugs, and doing other horrible things in every corner of the house. He said that he became very concerned about what was happening and began to think about how he could leave the situation.<br><br>The party was at a location far from his own home. He had gotten a ride with friends, and so he had no way to return home on his own. At that very moment he prayed silently unto the Lord, asking for help. After some pondering, he felt that he should walk outside the house. He followed his feelings and stayed outside the house until the party ended. That decision went unnoticed by his friends, who were all involved in that atmosphere and only regrouped when it was time to leave. During the ride home his friends talked about all the horrible things that had happened during the party.<br><br>This young man felt very uncomfortable with the whole situation. It was not easy for him to bear it, but the next day he went to sacrament meeting and partook of the sacrament. In that moment he felt calm, peaceful, and certain that he had made the correct decision. In that moment he realized what it means to grasp the iron rod and not let go, even in the midst of the mists of darkness. He understood clearly what Nephi taught his brothers when he said that "whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24).<br><br>Imagine what might have happened if that young man, simply out of shame, had not been strong enough to continue holding onto the iron rod. As a result of this and other decisions in his life, that young man married a wonderful young woman in the temple, formed a special family, and went on to be very successful in his life in everything he has done. He serves faithfully in the Church and seeks to be a good example to his children.<br><br>It is not easy to face temptation daily. We are all exposed to an environment that is hostile to the gospel of Jesus Christ. We live in a world that is deteriorating morally. Media and technology invite us to participate in destructive and life-shattering activities that are opposed to our beliefs and the values of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Pressures from friends who do not share our principles, or who share our principles but are weak in their faith, push us to participate in degrading behaviors. On top of all this, we have to deal with the natural man that exists in each of us.<br><br>The Guide to the Scriptures defines the ­natural man as<br><br><i>a person who chooses to be influenced by the passions, desires, appetites, and senses of the flesh rather than by the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Such a person can comprehend physical things but not spiritual things. All people are carnal, or mortal, because of the fall of Adam and Eve. Each person must be born again through the atonement of Jesus Christ to cease being a natural man.</i><br><br>One year ago, Elder Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the Church Educational System, said the following from this same pulpit:<br><br><i>Part of our earthly experience consists of being enticed by both good and evil and then learning how to choose good over evil. How could we become like the Savior if we did not have agency to make those choices? By using our agency to choose the right, we begin to put on the divine nature--to pattern our lives after His. We find peace, happiness, and freedom as we make right choices. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Satan will now deceive and blind men, and he will lead them captive at his will. If he is leading people captive, doesn't that sound like he is destroying agency? The fact is, he couldn't destroy agency in the pre-earth life, and he can't do it now either. If he can't destroy agency, then how can he lead us captive? He does it by enticing us to sin. When we sin, we subject ourselves to him. We, in effect, give part of our agency to him. He can't take it from us, but we can relinquish it.</i><br><br><i>. . . When we yield to temptation, we become subject to the will of the devil. Again, even though he can't destroy or take away our agency by force, we can give it up.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/paul-v-johnson_free-to-choose-liberty-or-captivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free to Choose Liberty or Captivity</a>," BYU devotional address, 6 November 2012]<br><br>There is a simple formula that President Thomas S. Monson often quotes that can help us avoid the distraction of temptation and keep us moving in the right direction. Quoting the adage, he says, "You can't be right by doing wrong, and you can't be wrong by doing right" ("In Harm's Way,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 48; see also<i>Teachings of Thomas S. Monson,</i>comp. Lynne F. Cannegieter [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2011], 84–85).<br><br>President Monson's formula is simple and direct. If we exercise faith and are diligent in obeying the commandments of the Lord, we will easily find the right way to go when we face daily small choices.<br><br>In that regard, President George Albert Smith liked to quote his grandfather, George A. Smith:<br><br><i>There is a line of demarcation well defined between the Lord's territory and the devil's territory. If you will stay on the Lord's side of the line you will be under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong; but if you cross to the devil's side of that line one inch you are in the tempter's power and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly because you will have lost the Spirit of the Lord.</i>[George Albert Smith, "A Faith Founded upon Truth,"<i>Deseret News,</i>17 June 1944, Church section, 9; quoted in<i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: George Albert Smith</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2011), 191; see also<i>CR,</i>October 1932, 26]<br><br>Therefore, we should always ask ourselves, "Are my actions placing me in the Lord's territory or in the enemy's territory?" Remember, "You can't be right by doing wrong, and you can't be wrong by doing right."<br><br>Let us examine what the prophet Mormon taught his people regarding this same topic:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i><br><br><i>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</i>[Moroni 7:16–17]<br><br>Our Heavenly Father has given us the Light of Christ. The Light of Christ is the divine energy, power, or influence that proceeds from God through Christ and gives life and light to all things. It helps a person choose between right and wrong. This wonderful gift, in conjunction with the companionship of the Holy Ghost, should help us to determine whether our manner of living is placing us in the territory of the Lord or in that of the enemy. If our behavior is good, we are being inspired by God, for everything that is good comes from God. If our behavior is bad, we are being influenced by the enemy, for he persuades men to do what is wrong.<br><br>The young man from the story I told you a moment ago used these two wonderful gifts. The Light of Christ helped him to identify what was right, and the Holy Ghost guided his decision about which path he should follow. These two gifts are available to those who hold onto the iron rod.<br><br>Now let us imagine that for some reason we have been deceived or confused by temptation and we end up sinning. What should we do? If we fall into temptation and sin, we have to reconcile ourselves with God. In the language of the scriptures, this means we must repent.<br><br>Repentance is<br><br><i>a change of mind and heart that brings a fresh attitude toward God, oneself, and life in general. Repentance implies that a person turns away from evil and turns his heart and will to God, submitting to God's commandments and desires and forsaking sin. True repentance comes from a love for God and a sincere desire to obey his commandments.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to the Scriptures</a>]<br><br>I like very much what Elder Neil L. Andersen taught about repentance:<br><br><i>When we sin, we turn away from God. When we repent, we turn back toward God.</i><br><br><i>The invitation to repent is rarely a voice of chastisement but rather a loving appeal to turn around and to "re-turn" toward God</i>[see Helaman 7:17].<i>It is the beckoning of a loving Father and His Only Begotten Son to be more than we are, to reach up to a higher way of life, to change, and to feel the happiness of keeping the commandments. Being disciples of Christ, we rejoice in the blessing of repenting and the joy of being forgiven. They become part of us, shaping the way we think and feel.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/repent-that-i-may-heal-you?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repent . . . That I May Heal You</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 40]<br><br>My dear young people, repentance is a wonderful gift that is available to all who desire to return to God. It is available to those who have the desire to hold onto the iron rod and allow the Lord to mold their lives into wonderful works of art. Repentance allows the Lord to use a hammer and chisel to shape our lives and make us into beautiful works of art.<br><br>We were born with the seed of divinity in our spirits because we are God's children. This seed needs to grow. It develops as we use our agency in righteousness, as we make correct decisions, and as we use the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost to guide us in the decisions we make during the course of our lives. In this way we shape our spirits so that they become admirable works of art.<br><br>This process takes time. Michelangelo was thirteen years old when he began his artistic activities as an apprentice in Italy. He followed his masters' teachings, and for more than seventy years of his life he produced works of art admired around the world. Like Michelangelo, we need to understand that it is possible to shape our lives from one day to another.<br><br>Our choices shape our souls. Recognizing our dedication and perseverance, the Lord will give us what we are unable to obtain by ourselves. He will shape us with His hammer and chisel, because He sees our efforts to overcome our imperfections and human weaknesses.<br><br>In that regard, repentance becomes part of our daily lives. Our weekly taking of the sacrament is so important--to come meekly, humbly before the Lord, acknowledging our dependence upon Him, asking Him to forgive and to renew us, and promising to always remember Him.<br><br>Sometimes in our daily efforts to become more Christlike, we find ourselves repeatedly struggling with the same difficulties. It is as if we are climbing a tree-covered mountain. At times we don't see our progress until we get closer to the top and look back from the high ridges. Please don't be discouraged. If you are striving and working to repent, then you are in the process of repenting.<br><br>Elder D. Todd Christofferson stated, "Overcoming bad habits or addictions often means an effort today followed by another tomorrow and then another, perhaps for many days, even months and years, until we achieve victory" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2012/01/recognizing-gods-hand-in-our-daily-blessings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recognizing God's Hand in Our Daily Blessings</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 2012, 21).<br><br>As we improve, we see life more clearly and feel the Holy Ghost working more strongly within us. For those who are truly repentant but seem unable to feel relief, continue keeping the commandments. I promise you, relief will come in the timetable of the Lord. Healing also requires time.<br><br>My invitation today is for all of us to allow the Lord to mold and transform our lives into our potential--into that which our Heavenly Father has planned for us.<br><br>Let us understand our eternal perspective and turn our lives into beautiful works of art that were planned by a loving Heavenly Father who developed a plan of redemption so that we could return to His presence.<br><br>I bear my sacred testimony that Jesus Christ is our Savior. He gave His life so that we might repent and change our character. I testify to you that, thanks to His love, it is possible to change. It is possible to leave our weaknesses behind. It is possible to reject the temptations in our lives and develop the attributes of Christ--if and only if we hold onto the iron rod. The Savior Himself shows us the way. He gave us the perfect example and commanded that each of us become as He is. His invitation to us is that we follow Him, that we imitate His example, and that we become as He is. I bear testimony of these truths in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ulisses Soares was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 5 November 2013.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>easurements We Make in Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to be here with you today. I am particularly grateful that my family, immediate and extended, can be here to support me.<br><br>Upon finding out that I was going to have this opportunity to share this devotional with you today, a colleague quipped, "Aw, don't worry. It's just like holding a big family home evening."<br><br>If this suggestion my colleague gave resembles family home evenings at the Reese household, then that means (1) most of you are sitting here against your will, (2) some of you will spend the entire time texting your friends about what you are going to do tonight, and (3) all of you realized that once that amazing musical number at the beginning of this devotional was over, it was all downhill from there! Of course, the most disappointing difference between this devotional and a big FHE is that nobody was put in charge of refreshments!<br><br>I appreciate your willingness to be here today. I pray that our Father in Heaven will bless our time together with an abundance of the Holy Ghost. I was taught once that the most important aspects of a meeting are, in order of least to most important, what the speaker has to say, what the Spirit teaches you, and what commitments you make. The godlike changes to our patterns of living are what define our character, celestial or otherwise. That we can leave here today with an increased desire to change some aspect of our lives is my hope and prayer.<br><br>A common question when meeting new people is, "What do you do for a living?" When I tell people I'm a statistician, their first response is, "Oh, that was the<i>worst</i>class I had in college." I don't even know how to appropriately respond to that comment. The second response I commonly get when asked about my profession is, "Why would<i>anyone</i>ever go into that field?" This is the question I get excited to answer. I get downright giddy when I get the chance to describe why I chose statistics as my profession.<br><br>The most compelling aspect about statistics that drew me in from the start is the role of statistics as sort of a gatekeeper of science. We are all familiar with the pattern of learning using the scientific method, which is to first formulate a hypothesis, then gather data through scientific experimentation, and then draw conclusions based on the data gathered. Statistics is concerned with making proper measurements, weighing the evidence in favor of, or against, the hypothesis, and then helping formulate proper conclusions. This process of making proper measurements and then summarizing the evidence is a powerful process that has helped push science forward.<br><br>Today I would like to focus on the measurements we must all make as part of our mortal existence and the role those measurements play as we form judgments. While there are many areas of our lives in which proper measurement is important, my focus today will be about measurements we make about ourselves and measurements we make about others. Like many aspects of our mortal existence, our ability to make good measurements requires practice and development of skills--both of which require time. I am optimistic that with some practice and skill development, we can all be better at the measurements we must inevitably make in this life.<br><h2><strong>Learning to Measure on the Lord's System and Timescale</strong></h2><br>Before I discuss principles of good measurement and apply them to our measurements of ourselves and of others, I would like to share an experience my wife and I had with making measurements and some of the lessons we learned in the process.<br><br>Early in my BYU career, while sitting in my office, the phone rang, and on the other line was someone I both admired and respected. He indicated that his organization, a National Football League team, had a job opportunity for me. One of my passions is the development of statistical methods for sports and human performance, so it was a job that I had dreamed about, and it was also both professionally rewarding and financially attractive. Indeed, this was a job that I felt completely prepared for, and all of the details seemed to point me in the direction of accepting the position. My wife, Wendy, and I discussed the job opportunity and felt that we should at the very least explore the possibility. We made all the arrangements to fly to the destination city. After a three-day, somewhat grueling experience with high-powered executives, we returned home with far more questions than we had answers.<br><br>With the offer in hand, my wife and I weighed the evidence we had gathered over the three-day trip by creating a pros and cons list. We were meticulous about making our list. Our measurement of the pros included financial considerations, opportunities to meet new people, and job-growth opportunities. Our measurement of the cons included moving away from family, the inability to teach amazing students, and no longer working with valued colleagues at BYU. As the day came for us to report our decision, Wendy and I gathered at the door as I prepared to leave for work. We had been praying, fasting, and gathering all the data we could gather, and there we were with lists of pros and cons that were identically long and equally compelling. It appeared to be a statistical tie. We were both exhausted by the process of deciding, so I suggested that the optimal way to make a decision in the case of a statistical tie was--yep, you guessed it--to toss a coin!<br><br>While I fully expected my wife to remind me that not everything had to be decided using optimal decision theory and that this really was one more piece of evidence suggesting that I was as nerdy as my profession suggested I was, I was shocked to hear her say, "Okay." She quickly grabbed a coin from the telephone stand by our back door and flipped it. I just as quickly grabbed the coin out of the air and said, "Okay, but none of this best-out-of-three business--one flip of the coin! Heads, we go. Tails, we stay." She agreed, and I flipped the coin. I don't know how many of you have had moments in your life when everything slowed way down, when everything seemed to go in slow motion. This was one of those moments. I saw every rotation of that coin as it went up and then ever so slowly--flip, flip, flip--headed to the ground. With anxious eyes and nervous hearts, we watched as the coin struck the floor, then hit the back door, then rattled around in a corner near the door, and then came to rest directly vertical against the wall!<br><br>Now, I'm a statistician, and I've flipped enough coins to know that this event has<i>zero</i>probability! We laughed (and cried) together as we realized that we weren't going to get off that easily. We had work left to do, and the Lord was not going to allow us to miss out on a growth opportunity. We asked the potential employer for a little more time and had one of the most powerful weeks of our married lives together as a trip to the temple and additional fervent prayer and fasting helped us measure weightier evidence than anything we had on our list. We had a sweet and precious learning experience that the Lord had in store for us--on His timescale.<br><br>It is about measuring both on the Lord's measurement system and on the Lord's timescale that I would like to focus the balance of my remarks today.<br><h2><strong>Measuring Ourselves</strong></h2><br>Perhaps the most important and difficult measurement we make in mortality is to assess where we stand as individuals. If we do not take the time to assess where we are in our relationship with the Savior, we will likely find ourselves moving backward. The prophet Alma understood the importance of having a personal interview with ourselves and of taking stock of our lives. His teachings are reminiscent of the Apostle Paul's teachings to the Corinthians to "examine yourselves" (2 Corinthians 13:5; see also 1 Corinthians 11:28). As Alma was going through towns and villages teaching the people he met, he encouraged them--and us--to have personal interviews with themselves. He even helped them with some questions they might ask, and I commend them to you:<br><br><i>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?</i>[Alma 5:14–15]<br><br>The answers to these questions are among some of the most important you will give in your life. The answers to these questions require honest soul-searching, personal pondering, sincere prayer, and a genuine relationship with the Savior. They require measurements of ourselves that allow us to take stock of where we stand so that we may make progress toward becoming children of Christ. The result is spiritual rebirth, and it is one of the sweetest blessings that our Father in Heaven has granted us in mortality. Of course, the process of making measurements about ourselves is not easy.<br><br>As we go through the process of making measurements about ourselves, a critical consideration is to be fair in our assessments. While some who try to make assessments of themselves will not hold themselves to a high enough standard, it is my experience that most are more inclined to be far too tough on themselves. In our quest for perfection, we will almost certainly find that our measurements of ourselves will be found wanting. Indeed, imperfection in this life is a reality. In this regard I am grateful for modern prophets and apostles who understand this reality and have taught us a remedy. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, in his talk "Of Things That Matter Most," taught:<br><br>[A]<i>key relationship is with ourselves. It may seem odd to think of having a relationship with ourselves, but we do. Some people can't get along with themselves. They criticize and belittle themselves all day long until they begin to hate themselves. May I suggest that you reduce the rush and take a little extra time to get to know yourself better. Walk in nature, watch a sunrise, enjoy God's creations, ponder the truths of the restored gospel, and find out what they mean for you personally. Learn to see yourself as Heavenly Father sees you--as His precious daughter or son with divine potential.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 2010, 22]<br><br>As we make measurements of ourselves, we must be fair. In a generation that is dominated by knee-jerk reactions that can be sent around the globe in microseconds and by the instantaneous measurements that are meted out through social media, we are often lured into making judgments without data. The virtual world that comes with the miracles of technology have a side effect of masking "things as they really are" (Jacob 4:13). Elder David A. Bednar taught the importance of making measurements about ourselves in appropriate ways and not letting the snap judgments of instantaneous response in social media overwhelm us:<br><br><i>Please be careful of becoming so immersed and engrossed in pixels, texting, earbuds, twittering, online social networking, and potentially addictive uses of media and the Internet that you fail to recognize the importance of your physical body and miss the richness of person-to-person communication. Beware of digital displays and data in many forms of computer-mediated interaction that can displace the full range of physical capacity and experience. . . .</i><br><br><i>Brothers and sisters, please understand. I am not suggesting all technology is inherently bad; it is not. Nor am I saying we should not use its many capabilities in appropriate ways to learn, to communicate, to lift and brighten lives, and to build and strengthen the Church; of course we should. But I am raising a warning voice that we should not squander and damage authentic relationships by obsessing over contrived ones.</i>["Things as They Really Are,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 2010, 21, 22]<br><br>Making measurements of ourselves is more effective when based on the introspective personal interview suggested by the prophet Alma, on quiet pondering, and on prayerful guidance of the Holy Ghost. Using these methods of measurement will allow us to make fair assessments and will reinforce the eternal truth that we are children of a Father in Heaven who knows and loves us!<br><h2><strong>Measuring Others</strong></h2><br>Measuring ourselves requires fairness and honesty. As we move beyond measuring ourselves to measuring others, we must exercise caution, because measuring others requires the additional virtue of patience. Indeed, the folly associated with making poor measurements of others gives rise to the concluding section of the Savior's Sermon on the Mount--the doctrinal foundation for discipleship in the kingdom. Matthew's recollection of the Savior's injunction on proper measurement of others is contained in chapter 7 of his record. The Savior said:<br><br><i>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</i><br><br><i>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</i><br><br><i>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</i>[Matthew 7:1–5]<br><br>Many interpretations of this scripture consider verse 1 in isolation of the entire section of scripture. My interpretation, however, is that verse 1 is a strong reminder that we are<i>not</i>to judge until we've mastered the prerequisites to do so. The next four verses are the Savior's teachings on how to make assessments of others more appropriately. In verse 2 we are taught that the quality of our measurements will dictate how we are measured. In other words, if we are harsh or unfair in our assessments of others, that same amount of harshness or unfairness will be meted (or measured) to us in return.<br><br>Verses 3 through 5 remind us about the importance of making assessments of ourselves<i>before</i>we make assessments of others. Fundamentally, the ability to make proper measurements of others requires us to first measure ourselves, remove the beam of unresolved sin through the miracle of repentance, and then, with the guidance of the Holy Ghost, make measurements. These measurements of others require a gift of the Spirit called discernment. The spiritual gift of discernment is one that we all have in varying degrees and one that can be increased as much as our Father in Heaven will allow if we but seek it out.<br><br>Many of us have had the embarrassing and humility-inducing experience of making a snap judgment about another individual based on physical appearance, only to be completely wrong about our knee-jerk or snap judgment. My young family was stranded on a deserted highway between Green River and Moab, Utah, late one wintry night when we were rescued by a kind, generous, and caring soul who didn't look quite like the angels we typically envision. This giant of a man, who wore greasy pants and a dirty flannel shirt and had hands that were rough and scarred from a lifetime of hard work and service, literally saved my young family. He allowed us to bor-row his car for the evening so that my wife and I, with our three children in car seats, could drive to the next town because there were no tow truck drivers available, and we didn't have the money to pay for one even if there had been one available.<br><br>A second mistake made by our natural man tendencies in assessing others is on the opposite end of the spectrum. As part of my work in the Young Men organization, I have been working through the Duty to God program. In that program the young men are encouraged to develop a pattern of living in which they learn their duty, make a plan to change some aspect of their lives to fulfill that duty, and then share their experiences with each other. This process of learning, acting, and sharing is a pattern that has made a huge difference in my life as I have used it myself.<br><br>Recently I was taking stock of my own life, and I realized that I needed to be better at taking the time to make better and more fair measurements of people around me. As I began working on this goal, I expected the results to be a reminder that I shouldn't rush to judgment about people based on their appearance. However, as is often the case, I was taught in a different, unanticipated way.<br><br>Steve is a friend of mine. Steve is one of those people who always has a smile on his face, who has an incredible number of friends, and who seems to have the ability to turn everything he touches into gold. He is one of those people who seems to be the best at everything and makes everything look easy. He's completely and totally infuriating! However, because I had a goal to try to be patient in my measurements before rushing to judgment, I decided I would practice on Steve.<br><br>As I began to observe Steve more closely and learn a bit more about him, I realized that he had been struggling with some fairly serious family issues. I also found out that Steve was experiencing some difficult financial woes as a result of some misplaced investments. In fact, Steve, despite appearing totally perfect on the outside, had struggles that were, in many ways, far more difficult and challenging than any that I had struggled with. In fact, I was just as embarrassed by this snap judgment as I was by the one I made on the lonesome highway in central Utah that cold winter night. Indeed, we are given different trials at different times. Being patient and taking time to make proper measurements of our fellow brothers and sisters before passing judgment is part of what leads us on a path of discipleship rather than on other less straight and less narrow paths.<br><br>In conclusion, I pray that we will all be a little more fair in our measurements of ourselves and a little more patient in our measurements of others. As we hone our measurement skills, we will be more like our Savior, we will be more effective instruments in His hands, and we will understand a measure of His love both for us and for our brothers and sisters. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, and I pray for change in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>C.

<h1>n I Am Weak, Then Am I Strong” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a joy and a blessing to address you this morning. You are such a remarkable generation in the history of gospel dispensations! Recently I participated in a dinner honoring the ambassador of a European nation. He had just finished a full day of visiting Church sites in Utah. I asked him what had impressed him the most. His face suddenly changed, and he responded in a voice charged with emotion, "What touched me most was the visit to the BYU campus and the Missionary Training Center. What beautiful youth you have!"<br><br>Last year when the Lord decided to hasten His work, it was to the youth of the Church that He made the call. Following the announcement by President Thomas S. Monson that the ages for serving missions had been lowered, a wonderful wave of enthusiasm came across the Church. Tens of thousands of your generation are responding to the call of the prophet.<br><br>Perhaps the change in mission age was a surprise for many people--especially those outside of the Church. Some probably wondered, "Why would the Church put so much responsibility in the hands of inexperienced young people who are barely out of high school?"<br><br>I remember asking the following question of several mission presidents: "Rather than young volunteers of eighteen or nineteen years of age, if we offered to send you professional missionaries who were older and had great command of the scriptures, missionary lessons, missionary methods, and language of the country, would you take them?"<br><br>They all answered without hesitation, "No, thank you. We love our young missionaries."<br><br>What is so beautiful and powerful in having a missionary force essentially composed of young men and young women without much experience? The scriptures are filled with stories of young and modest people who, having great faith and being magnified by the power of God, accomplished exceptional things. Among them were Enoch, who considered himself to be "a lad" who was "slow of speech";<sup>1</sup>Joseph Smith, who described himself as "an obscure boy" and "of no consequence in the world";<sup>2</sup>and the Virgin Mary, who marveled that she had been chosen to become the Lord's mother, saying, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, ... for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden."<sup>3</sup><br><br>These great young people had pure and humble hearts. Yet the Lord made them powerful in words and deeds to accomplish His designs. The scripture was fulfilled that said, "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty."<sup>4</sup><br><br>My brothers and sisters, this scripture is now truer than ever before. I often think of the enormous challenges facing your generation. You are living in an often hostile world at a time when great personal strength must be used to maintain righteousness and succeed in one's personal goals. Perhaps you feel too weak to overcome such challenges. Perhaps you fear that you are not up to it. There is no shame in that! Everyone experiences those feelings at one time or another.<br><br>I assure you, the Lord has the power to transform your weaknesses into strengths! The promise made by the Lord to the Apostle Paul is valid for each of you: "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."<sup>5</sup>And then Paul added, "For when I am weak, then am I strong."<sup>6</sup><br><br>This promise, though a paradox, is very real. Allow me to describe a few principles that I believe can help you receive strength to overcome the challenges of life.<br><h2><strong>First Principle: Build on Your Strengths</strong></h2><br>When you look in the mirror each morning, what do you see? We are such a blend of multiple and diverse talents, traits, and attributes. All of us have abilities, strengths, weaknesses, and inadequacies. However, getting objective and accurate evaluations of our own selves is difficult. While some take an indulgent and embellished look at themselves and overestimate their strengths, others focus on their weaknesses and doubt their own abilities.<br><br>One of the most comforting teachings of the gospel is that each son and daughter of God--every one of us--is born with an inheritance of gifts, talents, and abilities that can help us through our earthly mission. The scripture says, "For there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God."<sup>7</sup>We cannot be happy and successful in life without gratefully acknowledging those gifts and doing all we can to develop them. Our problem is never that we have no strengths; the problem comes when we do not recognize our strengths and build upon them.<br><br>A couple of years ago I saw a film about King George VI, who led the United Kingdom through the dark hours of World War II. When he was forced to take the throne after his brother's abdication, he doubted his ability to become the powerful leader the country needed in the face of war. George didn't have the charisma of his predecessors. He also had a disabling speech impediment, and his most dreaded fear was that he would have to speak to the nation in an effort to galvanize them toward victory.<br><br>One scene depicted George watching television as Hitler stirred up his nation to engage in war. Hitler's ferocious rhetoric and proclaimed invincibility contrasted with George's humility and apparent vulnerability. However, George refused to let his weakness overwhelm him. Instead, he used his God-given gifts of dignity, courage, and perseverance to overcome his disability through long and exhausting therapy. He eventually addressed the nation in a powerful speech and became the right man at the right place to lead his people to victory.<br><br>Like George VI, all of you have received remarkable abilities and strengths from the Lord on which you can build to overcome your weaknesses and bless the lives of others. With a humble and honest heart, seek to identify, develop, and apply for good those gifts that the Lord has given you.<br><h2><strong>Second Principle: Recognize Your Personal Limitations</strong></h2><br>In order to become strong in the Lord, we need to recognize our personal limitations. For some, one of life's greatest challenges is accepting their own limits. Because of pride, they prefer to see themselves as bigger, stronger, and more capable than they really are. They want to create this illusion both to impress others and especially themselves.<br><br>I would like to share an experience from my youth. When I was fifteen, I noticed that my vision was getting progressively worse. At the time, for a reason that I have a hard time understanding now, I didn't want to recognize nor accept it. I hid the truth from my relatives and teachers, and my life began to get more and more difficult. Being unable to read the chalkboard, I had to copy over the shoulders of my classmates. When on the street, I was no longer able to read signs and traffic signals, which caused me to take the wrong bus many times and get lost.<br><br>Several months passed before a medical checkup in high school liberated me from my secret. I had to resign myself to wearing a magnificent pair of glasses, which, to my great surprise, made life much more practical and enjoyable than I had imagined!<br><br>One reason we may not want to acknowledge our personal limitations is that weakness is perceived by society as a fault or a failure. The world values the cult of the invincible. Superheroes, from Batman to Superman, abound in our media. This ideology leads to dangerous behavior. We see people who want to hide their problems under the appearance of strength through boasting, aggressiveness, or abusive behaviors. Some are so obsessed with outperforming others that they turn to drugs or other stimulants in order to do so. Still others lose themselves in egotism and self-admiration. These forms of pride lead to disappointment, ineffectiveness, or worse.<br><br>God is not the God of superheroes, nor of people without weaknesses. Such beings do not exist! God helps people like you and me, those who recognize their limits and the weakness of their condition and seek His help and guidance. Failing to recognize our limitations will block our progression. On the other hand, accepting them humbly lays the foundation for eternal progression.<br><br>Recently I had the opportunity to interview Gaël Yonnet. Gaël is a former BYU student from France. At the age of thirty-one, while he was in his final year of medical school, he participated in a snowboard competition at Snowbird. It turned out to be tragic for him. He missed his second jump and crashed from a height of forty feet onto the icy snow below. When he regained consciousness, he realized that he had lost feeling in his lower limbs. After four years of medical studies, Gaël understood what pain in his stomach and numbness under his belly button meant. He was indeed paralyzed.<br><br>Gaël said that on the day following his accident, he awoke with feelings of intense distress. He thought to himself, "There are many simple things in life, such as going to the bathroom, that I can no longer do on my own. If that is how I am going to have to live, maybe it's better for me to die."<br><br>Shortly thereafter he met another patient at the hospital who was a quadriplegic. That patient confided in him, "I would so much like to have arms like yours." This was a key moment for Gaël. If someone could be envious of what he had, he should be grateful to still have it!<br><br>Gaël testifies:<br><br><i>We all want something more. I believe that is human nature. But I discovered that the key to happiness is to accept ourselves as we are, to be content and to live with what we have. I miss my legs terribly. But, in the end, I don't have any other choice but to move forward and try to be happy without them.</i><br><br>During the time he was at the hospital, he learned more about pain and about caring for patients than he could have learned in several years of medical school. Gaël decided to specialize in rehabilitative medicine. Today he is a renowned doctor who works with patients suffering from spinal injuries, amputations, strokes and seizures, and multiple sclerosis. His patients praise his empathy and his ability to understand their problems. For Gaël, the acceptance of his limitations was the starting point for his own exceptional progress.<br><h2><strong>Third Principle: Rely on the Lord</strong></h2><br>In the northern provinces of Canada there is a version of an old fable about two geese and a tortoise. They had a strong friendship. The story goes something like this: When fall arrived, the geese planned to migrate south for the winter. One evening the geese worried about the situation of their friend, the tortoise.<br><br>"It's too bad that you can't fly," said one of the geese. "You will certainly miss us. How will you survive?"<br><br>"I have an idea," responded the tortoise. "Why not find a good stick that you can hold in your beaks? I will hold onto it with my teeth. Thus, when you fly south, I will fly with you."<br><br>"Do you think you are strong enough to hold on for such a long time?" asked the other goose.<br><br>"Certainly. I am very strong," said the tortoise.<br><br>A few days later, somewhere over Montana, a farmer raised his eyes and saw something unbelievable: two geese flying over his head with a stick in their beaks and a tortoise holding onto the stick.<br><br>He cried out, "That's incredible! Who had such a great idea?"<br><br>Knowing that it was his idea, the tortoise couldn't resist and cried out, "It was I!"<br><br>And the tortoise fell.<sup>8</sup><br><br>This story illustrates how pride leads its victims to their fall. It whispers to them, "You can get there all alone. You just need a little intelligence and strength." This reasoning may work in certain aspects of our lives. However, it is of no value in accomplishing the core purpose of our existence. Are our personal abilities, intelligence, and work sufficient to enable us to fulfill the measure of our creation? Can we, by our own efforts, raise ourselves to the level of perfection required to return to the presence of God?<br><br>Certainly not! True wisdom includes recognizing our dependence on our Creator and His Son, Jesus Christ, to reach our full potential. Whatever our personal capabilities, we know that "no flesh ... can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah."<sup>9</sup>Where pride says, "I am the one who did it," wisdom prefers to recognize, "God empowered me to be able to do it."<br><br>After the remarkable success on his mission among the Lamanites, Ammon humbly recognized the hand of the Lord in these terms:<br><br><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Recognizing our personal limitations does not mean that we should put ourselves down and wallow in our weaknesses. Accepting our limitations is not an excuse to limit ourselves.<br><br>On the contrary, as disciples of Jesus Christ we aspire to that which is better and more elevated. The goal of our existence is to be raised to a level of perfection that will allow us to return to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father. We firmly believe that each son and each daughter of God possesses in himself or herself the potential to inherit all that God has and to become such as He is.<br><br>But no one can reach this ultimate goal by relying solely on "the arm of flesh."<sup>11</sup>If we rely only on our personal abilities, our progress is and always will remain limited. However, when we move forward "in the strength of the Lord,"<sup>12</sup>our potential for progress knows no bounds.<br><br>Another important point to remember is that we usually experience our greatest growth when we face difficult, if not impossible, situations. The acute awareness that we have of our own limitations pushes us to humbly seek the help of our Creator. An example of this is found in the Old Testament, when Gideon, head of the Israelite armies, prepared to fight the Midianites with 32,000 men.<br><br>But the Lord said to Gideon, "The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."<sup>13</sup><br><br>So, step-by-step, the Lord asked Gideon to reduce the number of his soldiers until only 300 remained. It is when it became impossible for Gideon to conquer the Midianites with his own strength that the Lord sent him to battle and miraculously delivered the enemy into his hands.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, you probably have had this type of experience yourselves. The Lord often places His servants in situations with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In this manner He pushes us to humble ourselves and to rely solely on His strength. He makes us instruments of His miracles and the manifestations of His power and compassion. That is perhaps the reason why missionary work is performed by missionaries who are, for the most part, young and inexperienced. It is also, perhaps, the reason why so many members receive callings and responsibilities that often appear to them to be beyond their strength and abilities.<br><br>I had this type of experience a little over five years ago when I was called as a General Authority of the Church. At that time my family and I lived in France. Life had smiled on us, and we thought we had received all the blessings we could possibly wish for, both within our family and materially.<br><br>One evening, completely unexpectedly, President Thomas S. Monson called our home. I can still remember the sound of his voice as he said, "Brother Caussé, you have been called to serve as a Seventy until you turn seventy." We valiantly accepted the call with faith and determination.<br><br>But in those few minutes our lives had been totally turned upside down! My call meant that we were going to leave our home country and live the next twenty-six years wherever the Lord wanted us to serve. Additionally, I had only a few days to resign from my professional responsibilities if I was to be ready to serve in the time frame requested by the prophet.<br><br>The next morning I woke up early to get ready for work. I remember sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast. Suddenly I felt completely petrified, even paralyzed. The idea of announcing to the president of my company that I was leaving his employment seemed insurmountable to me. I felt tied to him by great loyalty. Everything was moving too fast, too unexpectedly.<br><br>Overcome, I began to pray fervently, asking the Lord for the strength to do whatever He wanted me to do. When I reopened my eyes, I saw an issue of the<i>Liahona</i>lying on the table. It was the October 2007 general conference edition. Opening it at random, I fell on an article whose title caught my attention: "Live by Faith and Not by Fear."<br><br>I said to myself, "That's exactly what I need!" It was a talk by Elder Quentin L. Cook in which he told the story of his being called as a General Authority. He explained that he was not feeling up to the calling and had asked for counsel from Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Elder Maxwell explained that the most important qualification for serving in the kingdom was to be able to bear testimony of the divinity of the Savior. Elder Cook then quoted the promise that the Lord made to His servants in the Doctrine and Covenants, which says, "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ."<sup>14</sup><br><br>In reading this scripture I experienced a complete change. I knew what I had to do. My responsibility was to bear testimony of the Savior. The Lord would take care of the rest. Thus I left for work with a reassured heart.<br><br>The interview with my employer went beyond my hopes. I was able to testify very simply of my love for the Savior and of my desire to serve Him. At that moment the Spirit entered the office in which we were meeting. Touched by my words, the president assured me of his understanding, his respect, and his support. He later sent a letter to all the managers of my company asking them to do the same.<br><br>Is there any more beautiful experience than to feel the influence of the Lord working in our lives; to know that He is there, close by; to feel that He magnifies and enhances our natural abilities, thereby making us tools in His hands? I firmly believe that there is much more joy and satisfaction in saying, "It is the Lord who did it through me," rather than in saying, "I did it all by myself."<br><h2><strong>Fourth Principle: Qualify Yourselves to Receive the Grace of the Savior</strong></h2><br>The power that allows us to raise ourselves above our mortal condition and our human abilities is called the grace of the Savior.<br><br>As Elder Neil L. Andersen said, "Grace is spiritual knowledge and power that changes how [someone] sees himself, increases his capacities, and magnifies his ability to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Grace is one of the gifts of God made possible through the Atonement of Christ. The Lord Himself spoke to Moroni in these terms:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>I testify that this power of grace is of divine origin and is real and tangible. Each one of us can access it on condition of receiving the ordinances of the gospel. As is said in the sacrament prayer, one of the promises made to all those who persevere in respecting these ordinances is "that they may always have his Spirit to be with them."<sup>17</sup><br><br>The Spirit of the Lord, or the Holy Ghost, is the agent of the Atonement. Thanks to His gentle influence we can feel the love of the Savior and receive His grace in our lives. When the Spirit accompanies us, we become aware of a powerful transformation taking place within us as our weaknesses are transformed into strengths and our natural abilities are magnified and enhanced beyond even what we believe is possible. The Spirit sanctifies us and progressively raises us beyond our mortal condition.<br><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><br>My young brothers and sisters, I express my love for you and my deep admiration for the example and strength you are for the entire Church. Each of you has been endowed with a remarkable set of gifts, talents, and abilities. As you build upon these strengths, humbly recognize your personal limitations, remain faithful to your covenants, and put your confidence in the Lord, you will see your weaknesses transformed into strengths through the power and grace of His Atonement. You will have the ability to meet the challenges you will face in your life. With Paul you will be able to say, "For when I am weak, then am I strong."<sup>18</sup>Of these things I testify humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gérald Caussé was first counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 3 December 2013.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>s and Christ’s Invitation to Become as a Little Child: What Manner of Child Ought We to Be? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, brothers and sisters--the Plausible Evasion Research Institute, an institute I made up, has found that "in conclusion" is the most welcome phrase for most audiences, after "there will be refreshments after this meeting." So, in conclusion, I love Christmas and I love BYU devotionals. I am grateful to be with you, and my older siblings, graduates of BYU, are here, having traveled from Arizona and Idaho. They must have thought I was graduating today. I'm not saying my older siblings are old, but there were no history classes on campus when they attended, just current events. The deodorant Old Spice was then known as New Spice, and the Dead Sea was just mildly sick.<br><br>Since my academic focus is education law, and since much of that discipline and practice is focused on protecting the rights and persons of children, I'd like to discuss what it means in the perfect economy of the Lord's kingdom to become as a little child. I believe Christmas and the birth of the Christ child help us explore this concept.<br><h2><strong>Becoming as a Little Child</strong></h2><br>When our Heavenly Father wanted to save the world, He didn't take over a country or develop a militia. He sent a helpless child to a choice and worthy woman and a humble and believing man living in insecure circumstances in a conquered land occupied by a hostile force. The harsh geopolitical and military circumstances of Christ's birth should remind us that Heavenly Father can bless us even if the external circumstances of our lives aren't necessarily easy or peaceful.<br><br>Herod the Great ruled over that land, under Rome's ultimate control. He was mighty and built magnificent monuments--at least one of which overshadowed the land when Christ was born, being visible in all directions for miles. We can't help but contrast Herod's mighty palace with the stable. If we knew for sure where the stable was, wouldn't we wish to visit the site of that sacred birth? But who cares as much about anything Herod built, besides perhaps one or two of our learned faculty members? Most of us with a normal threshold for boredom ignore Herod.<br><br>Christ is infinitely more important. We seek Christ's words and probably have many of His words memorized. Well, not everyone does apparently, because I'm always surprised on<i>Jeopardy</i>when those brainiacs often seem to know nothing about the scriptures. We Mormons, in turn, are continually lost on the "Potent Potables" category. We celebrate and rejoice in the words and the happenings of Christ's birth. Does anyone, even the most bookishly versant among us, celebrate the words or circumstances of Herod and his birth?<br><br>The New Testament shows us something of the Christ child we celebrate at Christmas in the perfect young adult He has become. He hasn't become full of Himself and self-important, careworn, and brusque. Although Isaiah described Him as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3), Christ doesn't constantly groan under the weight of His office. Rather, we read in Luke:<br><br><i>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</i><br><br><i>But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:<b>for of such is the kingdom of God.</b></i>[Luke 18:15–16; emphasis added]<br><br>When Christ says that "of such is the kingdom of God," it is possible that He is also giving us a great insight into His nature and the nature of God and godliness. Christ continued and taught, "Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein" (Luke 18:17).<br><br>We must "receive" the supernal Christmas gift of the kingdom of God as a little child. If you and I in our weakness follow the plan of happiness our Heavenly Father has established--made possible by the gift of His Son--we will receive the greatest gift possible: eternal life with our Heavenly Father. How are we to receive and value such a gift? Perhaps we receive and value it by living abundantly, by repenting and becoming converted, and by becoming as little children. Christ warned:<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. . . .</i><br><br><i>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</i><br><br><i>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i>[Matthew 18:3, 5–6]<br><br>For our purposes I wonder if we shouldn't each consider ourselves as one who might "offend one of these little ones" when we let the world destroy the believing and loving child within ourselves by being weighed down and frightened by the world and our responsibilities and challenges. Christ seems to call us to put off childish fears and instead be trustingly and courageously childlike.<br><br>I have a friend, Mossi White, who as an infant was one of the unwitting heroes of World War II. Mossi's parents, and I guess Mossi herself, were part of the underground in Norway, and she acted as an unwitting secret courier carrying secret papers hidden in her diapers, where German soldiers were unlikely to look, for obvious reasons. Think of the fears her parents had to overcome. Had they developed what Christ meant when He asked us to develop a childlike nature? Is it possible that, in their childlike nature, Mossi's parents couldn't be frightened enough to accept that wrong was right or that there was nothing they could do to stop the evil of the Third Reich? Mossi's father was later captured by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp in Poland, which he ultimately survived. Mossi's parents saw evil, and they did what a beautiful child would do: they tried to make it all better.<br><br>Perhaps because she was raised by such parents Mossi has become a woman of great strength and courage today. She is a cancer survivor who served for years as president of the Provo School Board and as president of the American Association of School Boards, traveling and speaking extensively nationally and internationally, seeking only to bless the lives of children. Does Mossi's parents' situation and response remind us of the birth of the Christ child in a land and among a people oppressed by both military might and false tradition, just as Norway and the world were oppressed by the Third Reich?<br><h2><strong>Developing Childlike Wonder and Belief</strong></h2><br>Christmas gives us time to make memories in our quest for conversion to the childlike. I always tell my children, and I remind you, that we only get a finite number of Christmases on this earth, so we should enjoy each one and never get too mature to enjoy all the classic Christmas traditions, Christmas movies, and Christmas-themed jokes. (What did the snowman order at the restaurant? A hot chocolate and a mop. What did Santa call the reindeer that couldn't fly? Venison.) I often invite my children to stop and consciously imprint a memory or a mental snapshot during Christmas, perhaps of a snow-covered mountain on the continental divide in New Mexico while cross-country skiing or of hiking to the top of a 12,000-foot peak in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Or, in the case of my sister Paula's family, taking mental snapshots of scaring other family members by sending agents (and I have been that secret agent before) to leave a creepy snowman outside the front door of some lucky selected member of their family around the country. They open their front door to find this creepy snowman staring balefully, broodingly, and ominously at them.<br><br>I regularly enjoin my children to treasure and keep these mental snapshots from Christmas--and to not fear snowmen, a disorder labeled hominochionophobia. By the way, fear of Santa is the disorder labeled Claustrophobia.<br><br>I know Christmas is a mixed blessing for BYU students and professors. Beautiful Christmas lights appear, thanks to the efforts of our grounds crew on campus, but also worries over finals and final papers stalk the campus. Students are making plans to travel home, where they will dramatically collapse into their loved ones' arms, withered husks of their former selves, blighted and trembling from stress and lack of sleep and appropriate nutrition during finals.<br><br>Christmas is really most wondrous for little children and for withered BYU students. I hope it is not shocking to reveal to my own daughters (the youngest is fifteen and the oldest is a BYU senior on a mission in Nicaragua) that on Christmas Eve, after we put out the horse feed in buckets for Santa's reindeer, I was the one who emptied the buckets after they went to bed. What about childlike wonder and hope do we all try to preserve in ourselves and in our children through Christmas and its gentle deceptions? Is it a sense of wonder, a sense of the possible, as an antidote to fear? I suggest we all need to develop a sense of wonder as we ponder the Atonement and the childlike nature Christ wants each of us to develop.<br><br>I remember Christmases from my childhood, and they remind me of the love and preparation that my parents went through to provide great experiences for us at Christmas. To show my age, I remember a Christmas when I dearly wanted what some of my friends already had: J. C. Penney walkie-talkies. We used them to play army. Imagine the dim recesses of time before the cell phones and twittering you now experience. Contact was not constant then. I know there are some here managing text and twitter contacts even as I speak, arranging dates or Christmas travel or taunting a Yankees fan that the Red Sox won the World Series.<br><br>On that Christmas long ago in the sixties, I thought walkie-talkies cost so much that I had no hope of getting a set. When I got one, it was a miracle that I still remember with a little frisson of happiness. Almost immediately I went out with my friends on that Christmas day in Arizona to use our walkie-talkies to play army, as was our custom in those days, complete with gun sounds and medics who would attend to you after you had been wounded. Those medics would come up to the wounded and shamanistically wave their hands, muttering the magic words "Fix, fix, fix," and you were back in the game.<br><br>I realize that acting out such a bloody scenario today could be seen as troubling and would violate most schools' safe-school policies if it occurred during recess. Times have changed. Television in my childhood consisted of a grand total of three to five channels--one from Mexico showing bullfights and one an educational channel. Then prime time included weekly doses of the popular TV show<i>Combat!</i>with Vic Morrow, et al., or<i>Twelve O'Clock High</i>and other such shows based on World War II.<br><br>It's a little different today. Today most of you don't know that Jimmy Stewart, star of the Christmas classics<i>Mr. Krueger's Christmas</i>and<i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i>served through the horrors of World War II as a wing commander flying B-17s with great courage and skill. Most of you were not raised by a decorated World War II combat veteran who saw and inflicted horrific death as a B-17 pilot, flying daylight bombing raids over Germany when he was younger than most of you. And yet after the hell that such parents and society had experienced, such men and women as my parents, and perhaps your grandparents or great-grandparents, through Christmas and throughout our lives, protected us and let us be children untouched by the horrors they had waded through. They even let us play war without scaring us too much about what it actually meant. They knew that Christ hasn't promised we can avoid the horrors this world is capable of inflicting upon us. They also knew that we are to become as little children by choice, despite the world's horrors.<br><h2><strong>Living Life with Childlike Courage</strong></h2><br>When you were a child, you probably also knew what you wanted for Christmas. Similarly, when you were asked what you wanted to be, you had wonderful plans. How has your career path changed since then? I don't notice a plethora of cowboys, firemen, or Disney princesses on campus. When you were a child, did you say, "Well, I don't know if I'm quite up to the preparation and entrance exams necessary to be a doctor or the physical preparation required to be a fireman"? Did you decide you couldn't live on the low wages paid to cowboys?<br><br>To a child, at least to a healthy child who hasn't been harmed by abuse, the world and Christmas itself are all still fresh and possible. So what happened to you and to me as we grew older, and, most important, what happened to us that Christ wants us to combat in our maturity in order to become as little children? Why do we tend to become stuffy scaredy-cats?<br><br>There's nothing sadder than youth being wasted on the young. As an old guy, I admonish you young BYU students to not waste your youth and to not be big scaredy-cats. We're supposed to become as little children, and that shouldn't include a lot of fear about our future.<br><br>In heaven's economy, true maturity is the conversion of becoming childlike. With all the duties and responsibilities that weigh him down, I'd submit that our prophet President Thomas S. Monson is a prototypical example of maturing into this childlike ideal:<br><br><i>I reiterate that, as holders of the priesthood of God, it is our duty to live our lives in such a way that we may be examples of righteousness for others to follow. As I have pondered how we might best provide such examples, I have thought of an experience I had some years ago while attending a stake conference. During the general session, I observed a young boy sitting with his family on the front row of the stake center. I was seated on the stand. As the meeting progressed, I began to notice that if I crossed one leg over the other, the young boy would do the same thing. If I reversed the motion and crossed the other leg, he would follow suit. I would put my hands in my lap, and he would do the same. I rested my chin in my hand, and he also did so. Whatever I did, he would imitate my actions. This continued until the time approached for me to address the congregation. I decided to put him to the test. I looked squarely at him, certain I had his attention, and then I wiggled my ears. He made a vain attempt to do the same, but I had him! He just couldn't quite get his ears to wiggle. He turned to his father, who was sitting next to him, and whispered something to him. He pointed to his ears and then to me. As his father looked in my direction, obviously to see my ears wiggle, I sat solemnly with my arms folded, not moving a muscle. The father glanced back skeptically at his son, who looked slightly defeated. He finally gave me a sheepish grin and shrugged his shoulders.</i>["Examples of Righteousness,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2008, 66]<br><br>I know only a little about the many challenges our prophet is faced with regularly, but I do know they are weighty, and yet he does not appear careworn and beaten by maturity into losing the child within. What can we learn about becoming as a little child from our beloved prophet?<br><br>I hope it isn't inappropriate to say that my wife is not that mature. For one thing, she's about the only person, outside of kindergarteners, who laughs reliably at my jokes. She has been a professor in Boston University's School of Management and a highly paid consultant in the petroleum industry and in other management settings, including Boeing. Now she teaches kindergarten. One beautiful day she had the courage to say, "Although I like being a management consultant, what I really want to do is to teach kindergarten" (and be poor), so she made a major career change. You should see her in kindergarten. She reminds me of those Disney princesses when she is surrounded by her kindergarten kids. I expect to see singing birds and butterflies around her. Life is great in kindergarten, and you get to wear costumes at Halloween.<br><br>I invite us to become like her and like her kindergarteners, with their fresh and courageous approach to careers and the future.<br><br>I'd suggest, my young brothers and sisters, that you and I may have lost some hope as we've matured. Moroni said in Ether 12:32: "Wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared."<br><br>God hasn't sent us here to fearfully creep through our lives and education. I suggest that even in our hardest classes we could act this out a bit more by worrying less about what the professor thinks is important or what will be on the test and by worrying more about exploring what we find fascinating in the subject matter of our classes--and by taking time to prepare to serve our fellows and our world. One day soon you'll leave BYU--an extraordinary place. Will you have crept through this experience, preserving a businesslike GPA but not fostering childlike wonder and not making a powerful impact on hearts and individuals' circumstances? Do you fear and tremble before graduate school entrance requirements? Without hope, you cannot be pleasing to God, and, as a little secret, without hope, curiosity, and wonder, you can't really be too pleasing to your professors either.<br><br>Availing ourselves of hope, curiosity, and wonder, and adding faith to the mix, we should not choose too safe of a plan in our lives. We all know that if at first you don't succeed, then skydiving is not your sport. I'm not suggesting risking anything that is likely to foreshorten your time in mortality. I am suggesting getting a little more childlike joy out of trying more things, even if they seem beyond us. I'm suggesting not being slavishly concerned about convention, future earnings, or society's expectations if they run counter to the core of our best and most unique childlike nature individually. We need to be fearless and not fainthearted.<br><br>As a BYU student long ago, my brother-in-law was an example of fearlessness and not faintheartedness. Since the statute of limitations has run out, the story can now be told. In the dim recesses of time, when phones were rotary and thumbs were for hitchhiking, not texting, computers were huge and programs and data were entered into them on computer cards.<br><br>This gentleman, whom we'll call Frank, because that's his name, was an electrical engineering major here at BYU. The by-product of entering data onto computer cards then was that in punching them there were resulting leftover tiny bits of paper or cardstock.<br><br>Frank, and some undisclosed accomplices, collected and introduced this computer confetti, or chad, into the ventilating ducts of my sister's BYU apartment so that later, when they turned on their cooler or heater fan, they would be greeted by a Christmas-like shower of paper snow. Unfortunately, such chad or confetti didn't all come out at once. In fact, due to static electricity cling and the interactions of metal ducts and energized small bits of paper, there was a shower of confetti from then on every time the fans went on. I daresay that someone in this audience has just learned why the vents in their apartment still occasionally waft stray bits of computer-card chad gently onto their carpet.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, this greatly annoyed my sister's roommates--who were not sufficiently childlike, I guess--but Frank's pluck and daring warmed the cockles of my sister's heart. The point is that although Frank may have exercised questionable judgment, it was kind of cool. He dared and he won the fair maid because his own heart was not faint. Now, President Samuelson and members of the campus law-enforcement and student-discipline community, I'm not advocating any types of pranks; it's more a mind-set and a childlike courage I advocate.<br><br>A safer example may be my current colleague here at BYU, Chris Sorenson. When he was the principal of an elementary school here in Utah, a young man with a disability that confined him to a wheelchair appeared at his school with his parents to enroll. Chris wondered what class to assign him to. While the school secretary gave the boy and his parents a tour of the school, Chris privately knelt in his office and prayed about this student. He felt directed to assign him to the largest class, one already much larger than the other two sixth-grade classes. He didn't know why; nevertheless, he took courage and trusted in the prompting he'd learned to recognize. He ignored the possible displeasure of a teacher with an already large class size. He ignored any other concerns, because he had learned not to fear when had received an answer in prayer.<br><br>To his surprise, when Chris walked this student to his new class, as soon as this new student wheeled into the class, he lit up and addressed the teacher by name, with evident relief and joy. Unknown to anyone at the school, the two knew each other well. That particular teacher had been a loved and trusted Scout leader in a previous ward, and the families had lost touch with each other. Taking the courage to seek and obey the Spirit's prompting resulted in a successful start in a new school for a child who probably needed such a start.<br><h2><strong>Rising to Life's Challenges as a Christlike Child</strong></h2><br>In our lives, perhaps we could in a like way overcome fear more, seek wonder more, follow the promptings of the Spirit more, and develop a bit more childlike tenacity in action and belief. Often we slink away from a challenge before we even rise to that challenge. We should consider aiming a bit higher than we are in our imagination, our love, our lives, and our academic pursuits.<br><br>As I think of rising to the challenges life provides us, I'm reminded of one of the authors of the book<i>We Were Not Alone: How an LDS Family Survived World War II Berlin</i>by Patricia Reece Roper and Karola Hilbert Reece. Karola Reece spoke to our youth in our ward some years ago. Her family suffered because they, as pioneer members of the Church in Berlin, didn't fully join and support the Nazi Party. Her father had difficulty getting work since he was not a member of the Nazi Party. Later her brother was drafted into the military and was put on the Russian front. He made his own private covenant with God that he would not take a life for "Hitler's war," as he put it.<br><br>When Russian soldiers approached his foxhole from time to time in advances on the Russian front, he would shoot to the right or to the left or into the ground, but he would not shoot at his fellow humans for Hitler. This was his own decision, and I'm not criticizing any others who made different decisions in that war or in other wars. He and his fellow soldiers often would laugh and say, "Hey, what's wrong with us?" because repeatedly his portion of the lines would be ignored and not attacked. He survived the war without taking a single life in a cause he did not support. This also exemplifies to me the childlike nature we are asked to develop--of courage and of deciding not to collaborate with something the child within us feels is wrong.<br><br>As a further example of rising to life's challenges as a Christlike child, I'm reminded of one of my father's experiences in World War II. He was the pilot of a B-17, flying daylight bombing raids over Germany and experiencing and inflicting horrific deaths when he was younger than almost everyone here. Thanks, Dad, to you and to other men and women like you. At one point, after completing a bombing run over Germany, his formation was attacked by German fighters and flack, and his plane lost an engine. This meant that the rest of the formation had to leave them behind since they could not keep up. They knew full well that they would probably be killed because they had lost the protection of the interlocking fields of fire and the protection that a formation with its many guns provided. Then they lost a second engine. B-17s weren't necessarily able to fly with only two engines, but my dad broke the throttle quadrant and could over-rev the engines, buying time for some airspeed and altitude.<br><br>The fighters swarmed to this lone plane, ready to finish it off with relative ease away from the protection of the other gunners and planes. Dad began to pray, and he also thought, "Dad, pray for me."<br><br>In the Gila Valley in Arizona, his father--my grandfather--Ether Samuel Ferrin, got his wife and said, "Leven's in trouble. We need to pray for him." They knelt in humble prayer for his safety far across the world. These discrete actors' stories were obviously pieced together later. My Dad recounts that when they were sure they were going to be destroyed, it seemed as if they suddenly became invisible to the fighters, which would just fly past.<br><br>They were able to return home to England with that plane, which Dad safely landed. After that the plane was useless in the war effort. The ground crew presented Dad with the placard from that now useless B-17. He has that placard in his home in the Gila Valley today. The key point for me in recounting this story is that as a courageous child, my father not only prayed but cried out for his father to be alerted and pray as well, because he knew and believed in his father's faith.<br><h2><strong>Fostering the Child of God Within Us</strong></h2><br>So what manner of child ought we to become this Christmas season? As King Benjamin counseled, "Submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19). He didn't counsel us to be fearful or to settle for a safe but boring job or career instead of a challenging and exciting mission in life. I submit that we should be ready to be cowboys if that is what our hearts and the Spirit dictate--or kindergarten teachers or doctors or molecular biologists--and we should live our lives with courage and submission to the Lord.<br><br>This Christmas season I invite each of us to foster and care more for the child of God within us and bend to the exigencies of life and finances less--to take joy in the wonderful and simple journey to be the child that is like those who make up the kingdom of God. Paul reminded us in Romans 8:15, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."<br><br>May we trust our Father and develop the childlike attributes Christ and our prophet exemplify. May we cry out "Abba, Father," lovingly in words and action during this Christmas season, during our academic careers at BYU, and throughout our lives as joint heirs with Christ, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Scott E.
