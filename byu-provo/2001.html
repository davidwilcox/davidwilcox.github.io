<h1>s the Reason - President and Sister Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Elder Bateman:</b>Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be with you at the first devotional of the new year and the new millennium. Sister Bateman and I so much enjoy our association with you. We are pleased that everyone returned safely to campus following the holidays.<br><br>This is an especially important time in the history of the earth. The command to take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people is moving forward at a rapid pace. The world is being prepared for the return of its Creator. We know not the day nor the hour of His coming. Some signs still are unfulfilled. However, key events associated with the Savior's triumphant return are being recorded on the pages of history. The gospel has been restored, Elijah has returned, missionaries are working in many countries, and temples are beginning to dot the earth. The choir's beautiful rendition of Handel's "Lift Up Your Heads" is a reminder of the day when the gates of the New Jerusalem, the holy city, will be open for the Savior of the world and all of Israel to enter (Psalms 24:7; Revelation 21:21–25).<br><br>Today Sister Bateman and I wish to speak about commitment to eternal truths and the principles and values that must motivate our actions if we are to qualify for entry into that holy place. Our talk will draw on an experience we had in Japan a few years ago.<br><br>In the summer of 1993, Sister Bateman and I received an assignment to serve in the Asia North Area, which included Japan, Korea, and far east Russia. The opportunity to live and work in that part of the world was exciting. We had lived in Europe and Africa earlier, but Asia was new to us. As a member of the area presidency, I had responsibility for the stakes, districts, and missions in the three countries. One of the key assignments was to conduct mission tours. Each mission of the Church is visited annually by a General Authority, usually a member of the area presidency. The presidency member and his wife travel with the mission president and his wife throughout the mission, visiting and interviewing missionaries.<br><br>Shortly after our arrival in Japan, a mission tour was scheduled for the Fukuoka Mission on the island of Kyushu. Sister Bateman and I were to meet with President and Sister Cyril Figuerres and tour the mission. A few days before the tour began, a tropical storm, one of the worst in the history of Japan, struck Kyushu with typhoon force, wreaking havoc across the island. The city of Kagoshima on the island's southern tip was particularly hard hit as roofs were ripped off buildings, homes were demolished as they slid down mountainsides, trains came to a halt, and cars were swept into the ocean. Initially, there was concern about the safety and welfare of the missionaries and Saints, but reports confirmed that everyone was safe.<br><br>A few days later we learned of many acts of service that the missionaries had rendered during the storm. Missionaries had directed traffic at busy intersections where stoplights had failed. Two missionaries had helped a man change a flat tire in the midst of the gale as the owner was unable to secure his car on the jack and remove the good tire from the trunk. Throughout the island missionaries had assisted people in protecting their homes and personal belongings. Over and over the missionaries demonstrated love for the people through acts of kindness and service. In the week immediately following the storm, missionaries spent hours and days cleaning homes of thick layers of mud and helping with repairs.<br><br>Approximately one week after the storm, Sister Bateman and I met President and Sister Figuerres in Fukuoka on the north end of the island and then flew to Kagoshima to begin the mission tour. We drove from the airport to the chapel where the missionaries were waiting to begin a zone conference. As we entered the parking lot, we noticed the missionaries standing outside the chapel in a line waiting to greet us. I remember that as we got out of the car and approached the missionaries, the Spirit was so strong that it brought tears to our eyes and we could hardly contain our feelings. Their countenances exuded light. They were clean and well dressed, and their mannerisms reflected an inner peace and humility. A strong impression came that they had had an extraordinary experience--a refining one--as they had become Ammon-like servants to the Japanese people and to the Master. The discussions that ensued in the zone conference, the lessons taught, and the testimonies borne confirmed our impressions.<br><br>After the conference Sister Bateman and I discussed what we had seen and felt. We wondered if the experiences associated with the storm were primarily responsible for the special spirit that prevailed among the Kagoshima missionaries. Obviously they had been impacted by the events. But as we continued the tour and observed missionaries in other parts of the mission, we found a similar pattern of faith, obedience, and motivation to serve. We eventually concluded that there were a number of reasons for the faith and power displayed by the missionaries: the mission president was an effective teacher; the missionaries were obedient and responded to his teachings; and, like Ammon and the sons of Mosiah, they studied the scriptures, they fasted and prayed, they worked hard, and they "taught with power and authority" (Alma 17:2–3).<br><br>As we observed, Sister Bateman and I came to understand that the lives of these young men and women reflected a mission motto developed by the president that they had accepted as a guide. Their approach to missionary work and to life was described by this motto that Sister Bateman and I wish to use as our theme today. Our intent is to explain the motto and liken its principles to your lives at Brigham Young University. The principles taught in the motto apply not only to missionary activity but to everyday life. The motto reads:<br><br><i>Obedience is the price,</i><br><i>Faith is the power,</i><br><i>Love is the motive,</i><br><i>The Spirit is the key,</i><br><i>and</i><br><i>Christ is the reason</i>.<br>[Japan Fukuoka Mission Motto, 1991–1994]<br><br>Sister Bateman and I will take turns in discussing the elements of the motto. I will begin with "Obedience Is the Price" Sister Bateman will follow, discussing the roles of faith and love in our lives; and I will conclude with remarks concerning the Spirit as the key and "Christ Is the Reason."<br><h2><b>Obedience Is the Price</b></h2><br>In discussing the motto with the mission president, I learned that his desire was to teach missionaries the importance of obedience to gospel principles; then they would govern themselves. He knew that missionaries would obey missionary rules if they believed in and were committed to a higher set of principles. Thus he spent minimal time teaching from the white handbook but considerable time teaching from the scriptures. The Savior and Ammon were the role models. The mission president infused in the missionaries a desire to be Ammon-like in their service to the Japanese people. The mission president believed if the missionaries would humble themselves; repent; render quiet acts of service; and spend time studying, fasting, praying, finding, and teaching; converts would follow. The mission president's efforts were rewarded. Missionaries were obedient to the white handbook because they were obedient to a higher set of laws; and they found investigators to teach who then found the gospel because of the way in which these young men and women lived.<br><br>I feel the same way about students and the Honor Code at Brigham Young University. For the most part, you live the Honor Code not because you signed your name on a document but because you were taught a higher law in your homes before coming to the university. That is true for members and nonmembers alike. It is faith in a higher order that causes you to act and look the way you do. More than 90 percent of you stated in a recent national survey that you have never seen another student cheat on an exam at this university. The average for other universities is 55 percent (Academic Integrity Study, Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University, fall 1999). In addition, you strive to live morally clean lives and dress modestly because you understand the sacred nature of the human body and desire to treat it as a temple. In discussing the purposes of mortality, we point to the necessity of obtaining a physical body as a housing for the spirit so that we can become like our Father in Heaven. We don't often point out, however, that it is the physical body combined with the spirit that contains godlike, creative power. And if we honor that sacred power in mortality, we will have it in eternity. If we abuse that power, we will lose it. Our success as a university stems from your obedience based on faith in the Father and the Son and in the restoration of the gospel.<br><br>To illustrate this point, visitors to campus notice almost immediately a difference between this university and others. They remark on the cleanliness, the order that exists, and the light in people's countenances. Invariably they ask why the students are so happy. Two years ago a high government official from Europe was sitting by me at lunch. We were discussing his visit--including the lecture he had given, the questions asked by the students, and his tour of campus.<br><br>During the conversation he said, "Last week I visited another campus in another state. The students were different from yours. If some of those students were brought to this campus, could you make them look like your students?"<br><br>I replied, "No! I don't believe so! We would have to start with their parents!"<br><br>Behavior is a function of faith, and faith is determined by one's willingness to submit, to be obedient to higher laws, to "experiment upon [the] word" (Alma 32:27). The Savior declared that the power to redeem all mankind came from the Father as a result of His willingness to be obedient. He stated:<br><br><i>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</i>[John 5:30]<br><br>On another occasion Jesus said:<br><br><i>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</i><br><br><i>. . . Whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</i>[John 12:49–50]<br><br>Referring to the Savior's words, a BYU professor wrote the following:<br><br><i>Without such obedience and unity with the Father, the Lord could not have redeemed us. How else could he have had the power to stay with his mission in the face of the awful suffering it entailed? How else, except by suffering for us, could he have come to love us the way he did? (Alma 7:11–12.)</i>[Allen E. Bergin, "The Way to Christlike Love,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1982, 51]<br><br>Obedience is the price that produces faith, love, access to the Holy Spirit, and, ultimately, access to the celestial kingdom. It is the first law of heaven. Sister Bateman will now discuss the second and third principles of the motto.<br><br><b>Sister Marilyn Bateman:</b>Happy New Year! A warm welcome to all of you. Now is the time for looking forward to the new year and looking backward on the past year, like Janus, the two-faced Roman deity for whom the month of January is named.<br><br>As President Bateman has so powerfully illustrated, obedience is the price we pay to come closer to our Heavenly Father. Obedience is a way of demonstrating our faith. Obedience confirms that our belief is more than passive, that it is an active force within us. Elder Bruce R. McConkie observed that there is a vital connection between obedience and faith. He explained:<br><br><i>Faith is a gift of God bestowed as a reward for personal righteousness. It is always given when righteousness is present, and the greater the measure of obedience to God's laws the greater will be the endowment of faith</i>. [<i>MD,</i>264]<br><br>There is a kind of feedback loop between obedience and faith. We obey God's will based on the measure of faith we have in us, but as we obey, the Lord strengthens our faith even more. As we continue to exercise faith through our actions, our faith grows.<br><h2><b>Faith Is the Power</b></h2><br>This is the next part in the Fukuoka Mission motto. Why was faith included in the mission motto? What is faith? Faith is a confidence and a trust in something. In Hebrews 11:1 we read, "Now faith is the substance [confidence or assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence [or proof] of things not seen."<br><br>Faith is a principle of power. It is active. It causes something to happen. Some equate faith with belief. But faith is more dynamic than belief. Compared with faith, belief is passive. Belief is just an acceptance that something is so. For instance, even the devils believe in Christ, but they don't trust Him or follow Him (Mark 5:1–18; Mark 1:23–24).<br><br>The scriptures state (specifically, Alma 32:21 and Hebrews 11:1) that faith is not a perfect knowledge of something but a hope or even evidence of something not seen that is true. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that faith motivates our day-to-day activities, that faith "is the moving cause of all action" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:10). Because faith dwells within the heart of every person on this earth, we are constantly using this power in sowing seeds of one kind or another with the assurance that sooner or later we will reap a harvest. For instance, the farmer plants seeds in his field with the hope of a harvest. Scholars and students (such as yourselves) exert themselves in pursuit of an education--and eventually graduation--because they believe they can obtain their goal. The same thing is true with missionary efforts. If new missionaries feel they can find a golden contact and then put forth much effort, they will be successful. No wonder faith was an important principle of the Fukuoka Mission motto. Missionaries must have faith in themselves. They must have faith in the message they are teaching.<br><br>Without such faith, the Prophet Joseph said, "both mind and body would be in a state of inactivity, and all their exertions would cease, both physical and mental" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:10). If a missionary sat around and did nothing, President Figuerres, the mission president, knew that this missionary needed an increase of faith. "As faith is the moving cause of all action in temporal concerns," the Prophet continued, "so it is in spiritual [things]" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>1:12). All blessings, temporal and spiritual, we receive by faith.<br><br>Having faith in ourselves is an important ingredient in accomplishing our goals. We want to graduate from college, so we exert every effort to make it happen. However, some people put all their faith in themselves. Faith in ourselves can be motivating, but it is not saving--and by itself it cannot be sustained. It does not lead to life and salvation. Saving faith centers in the Lord Jesus Christ and through Him in the Father. The Apostle Paul preached that "there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). Jacob taught that men must have "perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel [Jesus Christ], or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God" (2 Nephi 9:23).<br><br>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel. Faith in Him is more than acknowledgment that He lives. It is more than professing belief. Faith in the Savior consists of sure and complete reliance on Him. As God, He has infinite power, intelligence, and love. There is no human problem beyond His ability to solve. He descended below all things. He knows how to succor His people according to their needs. We must have "unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save" (2 Nephi 31:19). Faith in Him means that even though we do not understand all things, we know that He does. We must look to Him "in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:36).<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ is the perfect prescription for all human problems and social ills. But His gospel is effective only as it is applied in our lives. To show our desire to be one with our Savior, to show our gratitude for the great mercy that He has extended to us, to help us gain eternal life, we must be actively engaged in showing forth our faith. We do this by prayer, scripture study, keeping the commandments, attending church, giving service to others, and fulfilling our callings and duties in the Church. We do it by expressing our testimony of Him, the Son of God.<br><br>There was a strong faith in Peter's mind and heart when the Lord asked:<br><br><i>Whom say ye that I am?</i><br><br><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[Matthew 16:15–16]<br><br>Nor was there any wavering in Peter when Christ taught the multitude at Capernaum, declaring Himself to be the bread of life. Many of those there would not accept His teachings and<br><br><i>went back, and walked no more with him.</i><br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</i><br><br><i>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</i>[John 6:66–69]<br><br>Christ is the Son of the living God, and He does indeed have the words to eternal life.<br><h2><b>Love Is the Motive</b></h2><br>This is the next part in the Fukuoka Mission motto. As President Figuerres urged the missionaries to be obedient and develop their faith, he encouraged them to mature to the point where their actions and goals were not motivated by fear or reward or duty but by a love for the Lord and for those they served. The highest motive for keeping the commandments is a love for God and for His children. In fact, Christ has told us that the two great commandments--to love the Lord and to love our neighbors--are the foundation for every other commandment (see Matthew 22:36–40).<br><br>Love is itself a gift. It is difficult for us to love others if we are not loved. Sometimes we don't feel loved or at all lovable. At these times it may be difficult for us to feel motivated to exercise faith or to show love. But God loves us. He loves us more than we can comprehend at this time. We need to come to understand how great His love is: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). Many converts to the Church report the overwhelming joy they feel in being converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. They feel God's love for them, and it is this love that entices them to be baptized and follow Him. John reminded us, "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). I, too, have felt this love, a burning love that encompasses my whole soul. When it is in you, it lights you,<i>all of you,</i>and transforms you.<br><br>One way we can experience a greater confirmation of God's love is through keeping our hearts and minds pure. Jacob exhorted:<br><br><i>Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause. . . .</i><br><br><i>O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.</i>[Jacob 3:1–2]<br><br>Fasting and prayer can bring us closer to the Lord and rekindle in us the fire of love that brought us to commit ourselves to the Savior in the first place. We have been promised that if we keep the Lord's commandments with a sincere desire to do what is right, He will not withhold His love from us:<br><br><i>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</i><br><br><i>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</i><br><br><i>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</i><br><br><i>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i>[John 15:9–12]<br><br>We need to have faith that the Lord does indeed love us. As we exercise that faith through obedience, we begin to feel the Lord's love more powerfully in our lives. All of these principles are interconnected; they engender and reinforce each other. As we feel the Lord's love take root in our hearts, as we taste of that sweetest of all fruits, then our love is kindled for those around us.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, there are so many of our Father's children in the world today who need our love, who need us to reach out and bring them into our circle. It may be that your expression of love provides the spark that witnesses to them that God loves them. Through your loving actions they may gain an assurance that God is a loving God in whom they can place their faith. I am touched by the chorus of a song by Deanna Edwards entitled "Am I Beautiful to You?"<br><br><i>Am I beautiful to you? Have you eyes to see my soul?</i><br><i>Do you know that I'm a child of God and your love can make me whole?</i><br><i>Am I beautiful to you? Do you see my light within?</i><br><i>Please love me from the inside out--not from the outside in.</i><br>[In Deanna Edwards,<i>Share Love's Light</i>(Provo: Rock Canyon Music Publishers, 1990), 27–29]<br><br>Share your own rich stores of love with those around you. You will find that as you do, you will only continue to reap more love and joy.<br><br>Our obedience takes on new meaning as we cross over from keeping the letter of the law and begin to keep the spirit of the law. Obedience, faith, and love are not easily separated out from each other. The source of our faith comes from understanding the nature of God--that He is a good and loving God who has the power to save us. The source of our obedience rests in a love for God and in the faith that by keeping the commandments we will partake more fully of God's love. It is my hope that each of us will exercise the faith necessary to call upon the Lord and receive a witness that He lives and that He loves us. It is my prayer that with this renewed confirmation of God's love we may open our hearts to others, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Elder Bateman:</b>I appreciate Sister Bateman's wonderful testimony concerning faith as the power and love as the motive for our behavior. She mentioned a feedback loop that exists between obedience and faith. She stated, "We obey God's will based on the measure of faith we have in us, but as we obey, the Lord strengthens our faith even more."<br><h2><b>The Spirit Is the Key</b></h2><br>What is the connecting link between obedience-producing faith and then greater faith leading to more obedience? As President Figuerres noted, the Spirit is the key. The Holy Ghost is the connecting link, the key to the relationship. The Holy Spirit confirms one's obedience to gospel principles with an assurance or witness that one is living appropriately. The confirmation or witness adds to one's knowledge, which increases faith (Alma 32:28–30). Additional faith increases access to the Spirit, which helps us be even more obedient. The spiritual assurances may be in the form of a burning sensation, a peaceful feeling, or increased joy or love. The Holy Ghost has many fruits with which to bless a person and increase one's testimony (Galatians 5:22–23).<br><br>The spiritual assurance through the Holy Ghost connects with the powers of the Atonement to change one's nature from that of the natural man or woman to that of a saint or celestial person. Listen to King Benjamin's words:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>The Holy Ghost serves the Father and the Son. He is our connecting link to Them. Christ promised the eleven Apostles after the Last Supper that He would send another Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth (John 14:16–17), who would "teach [them] all things, and bring all things to [their] remembrance" and "guide [them] into all truth . . . and [show them] things to come" (John 14:26, 16:13). The Savior further said that the Holy Ghost would not speak for Himself but would receive from Christ that which He was to tell us and show to us.<br><br>The Savior knows us perfectly. Through the Atonement He knows how to succor us (Alma 7:11–12). When one receives a prompting regarding a question asked in prayer or a feeling of love for another person or if one has a confirming feeling during a person's testimony, where do those come from? One should recognize first of all that the Holy Ghost is at work. In addition, since the Holy Spirit represents the Savior, one should also recognize that the ultimate source of those feelings or those promptings is the Redeemer Himself.<br><br>Have you ever thought of the many roles played by the Holy Ghost in our lives? He is a cleanser, a guide, a teacher, a justifier, a healer, a witness, a comforter, a quickener, a revelator, a sealer, and a sanctifier. He is the key. He knows when we are obedient. He knows how to comfort us when in need. He knows how to assist us without abrogating agency.<br><h2><b>Christ Is the Reason</b></h2><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we are blessed through modern revelation to know more about Christ and His purposes than any other people on earth. We know him as Jehovah in the Old Testament and as the Son of God in the New Testament (1 Nephi 21:26; Mosiah 3:5–8; D&amp;amp;C 110:3–4). We know His relationship to the Father as the Firstborn spirit in premortality and as the Son of God in the flesh with Mary as His mother (Colossians 1:15; D&amp;amp;C 110:4; 1 Nephi 11:18–21). We understand the Father's plan presented in the premortal council and the Savior's willingness to serve as the executor of the covenant--to be the Mediator and Redeemer of all mankind (Abraham 3:22–26). We know our relationship to Him--He is our Eldest Brother in the spirit (Abraham 3:27–28). These truths are not generally understood by the world.<br><br>We also have a broad understanding of His earthly mission, including the Atonement (2 Nephi 9; Mosiah 3:5–11; Alma 7:11–12, 34:10, 14; 3 Nephi 11:11; D&amp;amp;C 19:16–19). We certainly know more about the Atonement and the Lord's power to change us from mortality to immortality and from corruptible to incorruptible beings because of the teachings of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants (Alma 41; D&amp;amp;C 76). We know about His mission to the Western Hemisphere, which is not understood by others (3 Nephi 11–28). We know more about His work in the spirit world than anyone else. We understand the Resurrection and its meaning for Him and for us (2 Nephi 2:8, 9:12; Alma 11:41, 45, 41:4; 3 Nephi 11; Moroni 10:34; D&amp;amp;C 29:26, 93:33). Finally, we know about His sealing power. We understand that a key purpose of this earth is to form eternal families and that through the Atonement Christ has the power to bind men and women together for eternity.<br><br>Christ is the basis for all that we do. He is the reason we do missionary work. Without the Savior and His Atonement, there would be no good news to spread. Without Him, temple work would be in vain. Our progress would stop. But He did partake of the bitter cup and "finished [His] preparations unto the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19). As we come to know Him and to "learn . . . that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ" (Alma 38:9), we become better students, we have a stronger influence on others, we serve more faithfully as missionaries, we raise better families, and we become worthy to enter the Holy City, following the footsteps of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>I will close with a story that illustrates the influence you have on visitors to this campus as you live gospel principles and abide by the Honor Code. The story also speaks of the power that missionaries have to change peoples' lives. The moral of the story is the same whether you are a student at BYU, a missionary in Japan, or simply a member somewhere in the world.<br><br>Recently, as I discussed the Fukuoka Mission motto and the typhoon experience with President Figuerres, he shared the following story. During the Kyushu storm in 1993,<br><br><i>Brother Mitsunori Sumiya was rushing home from work in the torrential rain. He could barely see through the windshield</i>[of his car].<i>He tried earnestly to dodge debris blowing across the streets. Traffic was chaotic because traffic lights no longer functioned. He explained that everyone seemed to be looking after their own personal welfare as they hurried home.</i><br><br><i>Then he experienced a "defining moment" in his life. He saw young missionaries directing traffic at intersections. Further along he saw two missionaries helping a man change a flat tire. As he continued home he saw other missionaries assisting people in various ways. This good brother said he had a feeling of shame come over him because he realized that his constant prayer and only focus was to protect his car from being damaged. In stark contrast, the young missionaries' only focus seemed to be in serving others.</i><br><br><i>The member then received an empowering insight: "My core values are not rooted in Christ, but in worldly things like my car. These young missionaries, only half my age, have Christlike values." He realized that it is often in times of emotional stress and anxiety that one's true values are revealed.</i><br><br><i>Months later the member said to</i>[President Figuerres],<i>"Your missionaries are truly modern-day Ammons who serve the people of Japan spontaneously and without being compelled. They are constantly serving everyone, all the time, and everywhere because they want to, . . . because love is their driving motive."</i><br><br><i>During the years that followed, Brother Sumiya deepened his roots in Christ as a result of that experience, and his life began to change. Brother Sumiya became the first president of the newly organized Kumamoto Stake a few years ago.</i>[Cyril Figuerres, letter dated January 12, 2000]<br><br>It is my hope, brothers and sisters, that we will not shortchange ourselves in paying the price of obedience, that we will enjoy the power that comes with faith, that we will have love as our motive, that we will live worthy to receive the Holy Spirit in our lives, and that we will know that Christ is the reason. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>BYU President Merrill J. Bateman and his wife, Marilyn S.

<br>
<br>
I find it increasingly difficult to speak to you who qualify in worthiness, testimony, and personal capacity to be here on this singular campus. This sense of inadequacy comes from the deep respect and sincere love I feel for each of you. Today my intent is to help you, while your life unfolds in productive ways, to obtain the profound joy and happiness I am blessed to have. If such joy is the nature of your life, what I say will be a confirmation of what you already have been privileged to learn and apply. If that is not the pattern of your life, I will suggest truths that can help you find consistent, enduring happiness.<br><br>First, I will share a principle that, if understood and consistently applied, will bring enormous blessings throughout your life. It is not difficult for me to explain, nor for you to understand. However, it will require of you significant, determined effort to yield its full potential. With it you can learn vital truths that will bring you greater, enduring happiness and make your life more productive and meaningful. I suggest that you write down the principle as I share it. I will then explain it.<br><br><i>I will consistently strive to learn by what I</i>hear, see,<i>and</i>feel.<br><br><i>I will write down the important things I learn, and I will do them.</i><br><br>You can learn vitally important things by what you<i>hear</i>and<i>see</i>and, especially, by what you<i>feel,</i>as prompted by the Holy Ghost. Most individuals limit their learning primarily to what they hear or what they read. Be wise. Develop the skill of learning by what you see and particularly by what the Holy Ghost prompts you to feel. Consciously seek to learn by what you see and feel, and your capacity to do so will expand through consistent practice. Ask in faith for such help. Live to be worthy of it. Seek to recognize it. Write down in a secure place the important things you learn from the Spirit. You will find that as you write down precious impressions, often more will come. Also the knowledge you gain will be available throughout your life. Always, day or night, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, seek to recognize and respond to the direction of the Spirit. Express gratitude for the help received and obey it. This practice will reinforce your capacity to learn by the Spirit. It will permit the Lord to guide your life and to enrich the use of every other capacity latent in your being.<br><br>If I had the power to communicate the importance of the principle just shared, I could end this message now, and you would have received the major benefit from your being here. It requires effort and practice to consistently learn by what you see and feel. I suggest each one of you practice this principle now while we are together. As I ask a few basic questions that only you can answer for yourself, will you think of your responses? Perhaps you can jot them down. Then consciously ask the Lord to help you recognize any guidance He wants to give you. Since the Lord will not force you to learn, you must exercise your agency to authorize the Spirit to teach you. Continue to seek this guidance while I suggest some ways to realize your aspirations. I will also suggest what can motivate you powerfully to higher achievement. What you write down from the impressions you feel will be the most valuable help you can receive today.<br><br>Let us begin. Here are the questions:<br><br><i>What are some of the most fundamental priorities of your life?</i><br><br><i>What challenges do you face in realizing your dreams and aspirations?</i><br><br><i>What are some of the obstacles that impede your progress?</i><br><br><i>What motivates you to overcome temptation and live righteously so that the Lord can guide and strengthen you?</i><br><br>In the balance of our time together, try to recognize any spiritual promptings that will communicate a personalized message from the Lord. I will now speak to each of you as though we were in a private conversation where we share our purest feelings--as two can do where there is mutual trust and common beliefs.<br><br>The fundamental motivation in some lives is to be popular by doing what is popular. Others, more wise, are motivated by love of the Savior and His truth. They are willing to stand for correct principles despite peer pressure. I will illustrate the consequences of each of these patterns.<br><br>Recently I met an intelligent young man with outstanding parents. There are exceptional material and spiritual resources available to him. He is undecided about a mission. He attends a community college because it is easier than going to a university. In his free time he only does those things that he likes to do. He doesn't work because he doesn't need to, and it would take time away from his pleasures. He took seminary classes to pass them without much thought of how he should personally apply the knowledge gained. Finally I asked:<br><br><i>Can I speak to you from my heart? I don't want to offend but rather to point out something. You are making choices today that seem very reasonable to you. They seem to give you what you want: an easy life with abundant enjoyment and not much sacrifice on your part. You can do that for a while, but what you don't realize is that every decision you make is narrowing your future. You are eliminating possibilities and options. There will come a time, and it won't be too distant, where you are going to spend the rest of your life doing things you don't want to do, in places you don't want to be, because you have not prepared yourself. You are not taking advantage of your opportunities.</i><br><br>I mentioned how everything I treasure today began to mature in the mission field. Missionary service is not something we do for ourselves. We have our agency. We can choose what we want to do. Yet, for me, the greatest growth and preparation for the future that most youth have today is gained in a mission. There they focus outside of themselves on other people. They draw close to the Lord and really learn His teachings. They find individuals interested in the message but not sure of its worth. They try with every capacity--prayer, fasting, and testifying--to help that person change his life. That's what a mission does when it is done selflessly, as many here can testify. I felt impressed to give this young man a blessing. As he walked out of the room, I prayed earnestly that somehow the Lord would touch him to choose the right priorities. Otherwise his progress will be limited and his happiness short-circuited.<br><br>In stark contrast I share the example of another young man. Through the years I have watched how his parents have taught him from infancy to unwaveringly live the commandments of God. By example and precept, they nurtured him and their other children in truth. They encouraged the development of discipline and sacrifice to obtain worthy goals. This young man chose swimming as an activity that could instill in his character these qualities. The early-morning practice sessions required discipline and sacrifice. Over time he excelled in that sport.<br><br>Then came the challenges--for example, a championship swim meet on Sunday. Would he participate? To help his team win the championship would he rationalize an exception to his rule of not swimming on Sunday? No, he would not yield, even under intense peer pressure. He was peppered with derisive comments, even physically abused. But he would not yield. The rejection of friends, the loneliness, and the pressure brought times of sadness and tears. But he would not yield. He was learning firsthand what each of us must come to know, the reality of Paul's counsel to Timothy: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12). I have observed how over the years this consistent pattern of righteous living--woven from hundreds of correct decisions, some in the face of great challenge--has developed a character of strength and capacity. Now, as a missionary, he is respected by his peers for his capacity to work, his knowledge of truth, his unwavering devotion, and his determination to share the gospel. One who earlier was rejected by his peers now has become a leader of his peers.<br><br>Is there a message for you in these examples? How can you see with greater clarity and receive more help through the veil to accomplish your aspirations? I would remind you of eight of the many sources of help.<br><h2><b>First: Faith in Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>There will always be a need for you to walk to the edge of the light of your knowledge and testimony into the twilight of faith. You will be asked to exercise faith in truths you have not yet come to prove through your own experience or through the sacred witness of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Exercise faith in Jesus Christ and in His infinite capacity to bless. Faith leads one to action, to achieve goals even when there is little visible evidence to give hope of success. Faith is abiding trust in truth. Therefore it is a source of power to know simple yet profoundly important truths and to have the faith to live them. Enduring happiness is rooted in unchangeable truth lived in faith.<br><h2><b>Second: Guiding Principles</b></h2><br>You have likely established a set of guiding principles for your life. If not, do so now. With such standards you will not make the wrong decisions on the basis of the circumstances or the pressures of the day. Principles that you are determined to live by will keep you on track. Base them on the teachings of Jesus Christ. As you use your guiding principles, be honest with yourself. Tragedy, disappointment, and lack of attainment in life come when one is dishonest with self or with the Lord.<br><br>Never compromise your principles. Strength and safety come from making no exceptions to them. No matter how it seems that conditions would justify some departure from them, do not do it. Rationalization leads one to take something that is true and twist it to justify invalid exceptions. Rationalization is Satan's tool to lead one from truth. Difficulties in life start when small deviations from standards are justified on the basis of circumstance. Individuals who live for the moment make decisions based on circumstance or what someone else tempts them to do. Such are doomed eventually to violate eternal law and to undermine the great opportunities of life. They may seem to gain an advantage, but that is temporary. They lose those things that bring eternal happiness. As you center your life in truth, you are assured success and happiness.<br><h2><b>Third: Prayer</b></h2><br>You have found that prayer can be a source of great comfort, direction, and sustaining power. Too often in the routine of daily life you may be tempted to offer hurried, mechanical prayers of no value. Prayers that bring comfort, solace, direction, and great inner strength are like those offered by Enos. He taught the importance of praying with "faith in Christ" and being diligent "in keeping [His] commandments" (Enos 1:8, 10). These words of Enos show how to pray for something vital:<br><br><i>My</i>faith<i>began to be</i>unshaken in the Lord;<i>and I</i>prayed<i>unto him with</i>many long strugglings. . . .<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after I had</i>prayed and labored with all diligence,<i>the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires,</i>because of thy faith. [Enos 1:11–12, emphasis added]<br><br>When you are prompted to ask the Lord for something that way, you will often receive far more understanding and help than expected.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Scriptures</b></h2><br>The scriptures are an excellent source of understanding and strength when pondered with faith in the Savior. They bolster faith in truth. When the truths revealed are applied diligently, they become a vital source of worthy motivation. You will increase your courage to do what is right. Your discipline to adhere to the most important priorities of life will be fortified.<br><br>The scriptures give eloquent confirmation of how truth consistently lived opens the door to inspiration to know what to do and, where needed, the divine power to do it. As you reflect upon how others' capacities to conquer difficulty, doubt, and overwhelming challenges were strengthened by the Lord, the Holy Spirit will confirm that their experiences are true. You will know that similar help is available to you.<br><h2><b>Fifth: Temple Worship</b></h2><br>Another most significant way to enhance your capacity to understand and live eternal truths is through temple worship. Only by receiving the fulness of temple ordinances and living the covenants made there can you enter into the highest degree of glory and receive the greatest measure of eternal happiness. Temple attendance has a calming, settling, consoling influence that distills peace and contentment. It provides an environment for inspiration in answer to prayers. The accompanying family history work yields similar blessings.<br><h2><b>Sixth: Moral Cleanliness</b></h2><br>Your goal to be morally clean is central to your enduring happiness. You decide by your daily choices whether it will be realized. Garner strength by remembering that you can do anything the Lord asks you to do. When strength is needed, and asked for, He will help you keep this vital commandment. As you do all you are capable of doing, your trust in Him will give you capacity to overcome all obstacles.<br><h2><b>Seventh: Consistent Hard Work</b></h2><br>It is a principle of happiness to work hard and to willingly obey the principles of truth, confident that the Lord will open doors of help when needed. You are learning the valuable lesson that significant attainment requires significant effort. Our Father will not violate His plan. He will not give eternal blessings to those who want them but who are not willing to pay the price.<br><h2><b>Eighth: Good Music</b></h2><br>Good music, especially sacred music, makes spiritual things more understandable. It is edifying and conducive to willing obedience. It prepares emotions for response to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Stay away from the poison of evil music.<br><br>I am afraid it may seem like I've been lecturing to you in our private interview. Forgive me. I don't mean to do that. I just want to share what has brought me immeasurable happiness along with a meaningful life.<br><br>There is one additional suggestion before I end. Some places are sacred and holy where it seems easier to discern the direction of the Holy Spirit. The temple is such a place. You can make other places that way by the way you respect them and behave while there. You need a retreat of peace and quiet where periodically you can ponder and let the Lord establish the direction of your life. It may seem difficult to find time to meditate with the daily pressures of university life. Yet a moment of thought will confirm that no matter how fast you move forward, if you are on the wrong path, it will avail you nothing. Each of us needs to periodically check our bearings and confirm that we are on course. The beginning of a new semester seems like an ideal time to do it. Sometime soon you may benefit from taking this personal inventory:<br><br><i>What are my highest priorities for life?</i><br><br><i>How do I use my discretionary time? Is some of it consistently used for my highest priorities?</i><br><br><i>Is there anything I know I should not be doing? If so, I will stop it now.</i><br><br>I sincerely thank you for listening so intently and for writing the impressions you have felt. It is such an edifying experience to be with you here at Brigham Young University. You are a precious treasure. Your righteous lives will bless many others wherever you go. I feel that you either have been or will be doing the things we've discussed. I have left the most important thing I can do for you for these last moments.<br><br>I solemnly testify that God our Father lives, that His plan is perfect. I bear testimony that as you raise your voice in prayer, those prayers are heard. They are best answered when offered from a broken heart and a contrite spirit. I know that someday I will be judged for how well I testify of my certain knowledge of Jesus Christ. Therefore, I solemnly witness that because of His Atonement, our Father's plan of happiness will succeed. Satan's plan is doomed to failure. I know that Jesus Christ lives. I solemnly witness with every capacity that I possess that He lives and that He loves you. Through your obedience He will help you find happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<br>
I thought if somehow I could help you understand the deep love and affection that our Brethren of the General Authorities have for you, my time tonight, and yours as well, would be well spent. Will you please know how deeply you are loved and respected and how very much concern and prayer goes up to our Father in Heaven in your behalf? I appreciate that beautiful music, and that particular number ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30) reminds us of the times of oxen and wagons and handcarts and horses--when 15 miles a day would have been considered a fair day's travel.<br><br>Last November I had the opportunity to travel with President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Boyd K. Packer, Elder David B. Haight, and others to Nauvoo to the dedication of the cornerstones of the temple, which was a reenactment of the original cornerstone dedication under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith. And yet it was not just a reenactment; it was, in fact, a dedication of those stones. We arose at a normal hour at home, had time for breakfast, flew to Nauvoo, completed that marvelous experience of the dedication, and were home in ample time for dinner with the family. I could not help but think of my ancestors and others who paid such a price to travel that same distance over many months with enormous cost in sacrifice of comfort and safety.<br><br>We have made similar advances in the opportunities for communication, education, and learning, yet I am sure we have barely scratched the surface. Just stop and realize that there is, even now, an explosion of resources that makes it possible for a person living in the most remote areas of the world to have access to the finest libraries.<br><br>Yet in all this, we would do well to remember that some things do not change. Tonight I would like to talk about principles, values that do not change, and the role that our present prophets have in holding us firm to those principles. These values and principles are as new and fresh as the latest Internet communication. Yet living by them has blessed mankind since the very dawn of this earth's existence.<br><br>In September 1995 in the general Relief Society meeting, President Hinckley introduced a remarkable document. It was the work of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve and most certainly the inspiration of heaven. President Hinckley said in introducing that document:<br><br><i>With so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth, with so much of deception concerning standards and values, with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn. In furtherance of this we of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles now issue a proclamation to the Church and to the world as a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history.</i>["Stand Strong Against the Wiles of the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 100]<br><br>He then read the entire proclamation. Would you note some words he used--<i>deception, allurement, enticement, warn,</i>and<i>forewarn.</i><br><h2><b>Study the Proclamation on the Family</b></h2><br>The majority of those of you listening tonight will within a few months or years seriously contemplate getting married. Some of you may have already taken that very important step. May I suggest in all seriousness and solemnity that a very careful study of that proclamation will assist you in a major way as you begin to build a home and a family. Now a voice of warning. If your proposed marriage partner is not in agreement with the doctrines taught therein, know there is danger in your committing your life to him or to her.<br><br>When I was first presented with a copy of the proclamation and noted that it carried the stamp of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve, I was reminded of a day many years ago when I was sitting in general conference; it was long before the call to the Seventy came to me. President Joseph Fielding Smith was talking. It was priesthood meeting. It was the last general priesthood meeting prior to his death, and he made a statement that settled on my soul as pure truth. Let me quote it to you:<br><br><i>Now, brethren, I think there is one thing which we should have exceedingly clear in our minds. Neither the President of the Church, nor the First Presidency, nor the united voice of the First Presidency and the Twelve will ever lead the Saints astray or send forth counsel to the world that is contrary to the mind and will of the Lord.</i>[In Conference Report, April 1972, 99; or "Eternal Keys and the Right to Preside,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1972, 88]<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, I stand here tonight as a witness of the truthfulness of that statement. It has been made clear to me more times than I can count that the senior Brethren--those whom we sustain as apostles, prophets, and revelators--speak the mind and will of the Lord as President Smith bore witness they do. With that in mind, let me read portions of the proclamation:<br><br><i>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, if the number-one objective of your life is not to establish an eternal family, then you are going to forego an essential element for happiness here and hereafter. I might say that you would be wise not to put off that day for trivial reasons or maybe for reasons that aren't so trivial. To continue: "All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents." Will you note that?<br><br><i>Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><br><br>As you read the proclamation, consider every single sentence. For instance, there is a great deal of confusion today in the world about gender. Here the prophets have spoken clearly. Note this:<br><br><i>In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. . . .</i><br><br><i>The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.</i><br><br>Now, let me say to you that you are challenged. You of your generation are challenged to live in a world that has largely abandoned the doctrine just read. Current thinking suggests that families impede one's career or certainly interfere with personal fulfillment. I promise you that you can be certain that sorrow and regret will eventually come to those who ignore or rebel against this commandment from our Father in Heaven. I read from the proclamation again:<br><br><i>We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</i><br><br>Please forgive me for speaking very frankly. Far too many of your generation think it is all right to dabble in sexual sin and that they will be free from any serious consequences. Listen carefully to the following warning and instruction that was given to the young men of the Church some months ago. President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>You live in a world of terrible temptations. Pornography, with its sleazy filth, sweeps over the earth like a horrible, engulfing tide. It is poison. Do not watch it or read it. It will destroy you if you do. It will take from you your self-respect. It will rob you of a sense of the beauties of life. It will tear you down and pull you into a slough of evil thoughts and possibly of evil actions. Stay away from it. Shun it as you would a foul disease, for it is just as deadly. Be virtuous in thought and in deed. God has planted in you, for a purpose, a divine urge which may be easily subverted to evil and destructive ends. When you are young, do not get involved in steady dating. When you reach an age where you think of marriage, then is the time to become so involved.</i>[In Conference Report, October 1997, 71–72; or "Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1997, 51]<br><br>Can you not feel the spiritual power of that man whom the Lord has raised up to lead us giving a warning to you individually? You may say, "Well, that is good for someone else." Will you contemplate his words in your own life? Measure your activities against what the prophet has asked us to do. Do you realize that the message through the ages from the prophets has been to stay clean, to stay pure, and they promise that you will reap unlimited happiness? Now let us return to the proclamation:<br><br><i>We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.</i><br><br>Much of what is seen today on network television, videos, movies, other means of communication, and the Internet is degrading to women and desecrates the sacredness of the power of procreation. I would that I had sufficient words or capacity in the English language to impress upon you the necessity of cleanliness of thought and action in order to build a strong foundation of righteousness in anticipation of a happy and fulfilling life. I testify to you from the depth of my soul that what President Hinckley just said is true. Think about it. I quote again from the proclamation:<br><br><i>Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. "Children are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs,</i><br><br>[Did you note "to provide for their physical needs"? I'll come back to that in a few minutes. Let me continue:]<br><br><i>to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.</i><br><br>Do not take lightly that last statement: "Will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations."<br><h2><b>Discipline Brings Freedom</b></h2><br>Would you note the comment from the Brethren about the necessity for parents to provide for their children's physical needs? When we are small children, we want what we want when we want it, and some of us never get over that impediment; we remain self-centered and demanding of others as we reach adulthood.<br><br>Will you understand that we simply cannot have all that we may want at any age? Discipline and freedom walk hand in hand. License is not freedom, though Lucifer would have you think so. License is eventually slavery. Discipline will bring freedom. I realize that may sound strange; it is the truth. Discipline in every facet of your lives will bring you freedom. One without the other will not deliver the rewards we seek. Much unhappiness develops in a home where there is no financial discipline. Think about that. Even prior to your marriage, practice financial discipline.<br><br>Permit me to read the words of the president of the Church as he gave them to us in priesthood meeting in October of 1998 (Gordon B. Hinckley, in Conference Report, October 1998, 69–72; or "To the Boys and to the Men,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, 52–54). He said: "I wish to speak to you about temporal matters." He then reviewed the experiences of Joseph of Egypt and the seven years of plenty followed by the seven years of famine. Now, note carefully. Then he said:<br><br><i>I am suggesting that the time has come to get our houses in order.</i><br><br><i>So many of our people are living on the very edge of their incomes. In fact, some are living on borrowings.</i><br><br><i>We have witnessed in recent weeks wide and fearsome swings in the markets of the world. The economy is a fragile thing. A stumble in the economy in Jakarta or Moscow can immediately affect the entire world. It can eventually reach down to each of us as individuals.</i>[Note the next sentence:]<i>There is a portent of stormy weather ahead to which we had better give heed.</i><br><br>Might I say that those words are filled with warning from one who is a seer, one who can see afar off, and through his prophetic insight raises a warning voice. He continued:<br><br><i>I am troubled by the huge consumer installment debt which hangs over the people of the nation, including our own people. . . .</i><br><br><i>I recognize that it may be necessary to borrow to get a home, of course. But let us buy a home that we can afford and thus ease the payments which will constantly hang over our heads without mercy or respite for as long as 30 years. . . .</i><br><br><i>I urge you, brethren . . .</i><br><br>Keep in mind, sisters, that this was a priesthood meeting. I'm sure the counsel is good for each of us.<br><br><i>I urge you, brethren, to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage.</i><br><br><i>This is a part of the temporal gospel in which we believe. May the Lord bless you, my beloved brethren, to set your houses in order.</i><br><br>When I returned from my full-time mission years ago, in those days we used to report our missions to General Authorities. I gave mine to Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As part of that report he gave me some marvelous advice, which you may think is very difficult to do. He told me to always pay my tithing, which would not be a surprise from a member of the Twelve. But then he said to save an equal amount. He suggested the best place to invest the savings was in education both for me and for my future wife. The second-best place was to invest in a home. The third was anywhere else as long as it was an investment that protected my hard-earned savings.<br><br>I would heartily recommend you carefully consider Elder Richards' counsel. I was younger than many of you here tonight when he gave me this counsel. Most of you won't even remember, but in my young days Will Rogers was a famous cowboy philosopher. He said, "I am more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money." That's good counsel.<br><br>A very recent newspaper editorial indicated that "a record 15,138 Utahns filed for bankruptcy last year, an increase of 8 percent over 1999." Think about that. Consider this: Utah is the number-two state in the nation "for per-capita bankruptcy filings," according to this editorial ("Broken Promises,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>15 January 2001, A8).<br><br>What an indictment of those of us who live in Utah! I appreciate that many listening tonight are not natives of Utah. I think the principle and the problem might extend to you, and I ask you to think about it. We, of all the people in the entire world, should have learned by sad experience to listen to the prophets. Hear me carefully so you don't misunderstand. Our bankruptcy law is on the books for the rare occasion when true disaster strikes a family, and none of us would take away that protection. But I'll also tell you it cannot function as it ought in a society with overextended and, frankly, somewhat dishonest people.<br><br>The editorial goes on to suggest that the majority of these 15,000 people are not using chapter 13. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Act permits the applicant to repay his debts over a longer period of time, but to pay them himself or herself. Instead, more than 9,000 of those 15,000 people applied for chapter 7, which permits one to break his promises to his creditors and walk away from his debts, leaving his obligations forever unpaid.<br><br>We have just enjoyed a period of economic health in Utah and most other areas in the United States rarely matched in our history. Yet in the midst of all this, a record number of Utahns wanted someone else to pay their debts. Now, as I said a moment ago, I have only the statistics for Utah, but I am quite certain this is not a Utah problem only.<br><br>There is a question asked of those who seek a temple recommend that deals with honesty. I sincerely hope that those who have taken unfair advantage of this just and proper law don't carry a temple recommend and feel that they're absolved from responsibilities. I wonder how many there might be in that situation.<br><br>Well, there's been in the last decade, in my judgment, a serious decline in honesty, truthfulness, fidelity, honor, and veracity. In their place, many have substituted duplicity and falsehood.<br><br>Surely President Hinckley's counsel to set your houses in order is important to remember as you look forward to establishing permanent homes.<br><br>In the early days of the Restoration, the Lord called upon the Saints to settle in Jackson County, Missouri. They had been there just a few years when they were driven out by armed mobs. The Prophet Joseph Smith, who was in Kirtland at the time, received the mind and will of the Lord as to why this had happened. Now keep in mind they were sent to Jackson County at the instruction of the Prophet. They were then driven out. Obviously the president of the Church was concerned about what had happened. The Lord answered him in the revelation we know as section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Will you note carefully the Lord's words?<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted, and persecuted, and cast out from the land of their inheritance--</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their transgressions.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:1–2]<br><br>The Lord enumerates some of those transgressions, and, by the way, among them was not murder, not adultery, not thievery--those which we might consider to be of enormous consequences. The last one the Lord mentioned was this one:<br><br><i>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</i><br><br><i>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:7–8; see also<i>HC</i>1:453–64]<br><br>The Lord also made clear in verse 3 of that revelation that "they shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels," but I would add they did learn by their suffering to hear the word of the Lord through His prophets.<br><br>Now a fundamental truth: A great deal of contention originates in the home over a lack of discipline in financial matters. Remember again, discipline is a prerequisite to personal and family freedom. Let us return to the proclamation:<br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.</i><br><br>I know these quotes are long today. I wondered and worried about that but honestly felt I could not describe the doctrines that I thought you needed to understand as they are recorded in this magnificent proclamation. Now let us come to a conclusion of the proclamation:<br><br><i>We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God.</i><br><br>Do you note how many times the First Presidency and the Twelve have indicated to us that if we refuse to hear them and we refuse to obey we will account not to them but before God? We continue:<br><br><i>Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</i><br><h2><b>Heed the Voice of the Lord Through His Prophets</b></h2><br>I said a moment ago that I have a sincere conviction that we will in fact one day stand before God. We live in times of peace and plenty for the most part. I must admit that I have a fear that in another day, another time, our descendants may one day describe us as<br><br><i>slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</i><br><br><i>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:7–8]<br><br>Whether it be in matters of obedience to spiritual laws or to temporal laws, we would be very wise to listen to His counsel as revealed through His servants the prophets in the days of our peace.<br><br>Now, sisters, in President Hinckley's talk to you the day he introduced the proclamation on the family, he said these words:<br><br><i>I believe this is the best season for women in all the history of the world. In opportunities for education, for the training of your hands and minds, there has never before been a time when doors were so widely opened to you as they are today.</i><br><br><i>But neither has there been a time, at least in recent history, when you have been confronted with more challenging problems. I need not remind you that the world we are in is a world of turmoil, of shifting values. Shrill voices call out for one thing or another in betrayal of time-tested standards of behavior. The moral moorings</i>[note President Hinckley said "the moral moorings"]<i>of our society have been badly shaken. So many of the youth of the world, and likewise so many of their elders, listen only to the seductive voice of self-gratification. You single young women face tremendous challenges, and we know it is not easy for you. I cannot say enough of appreciation for your determination to live by the standards of the Church, to walk with the strength of virtue, to keep your minds above the slough of filth which seems to be moving like a flood across the world.</i>["Stand Strong Against the Wiles of the World," 99]<br><br>"The seductive voice of self-gratification"--the lure, my young brothers and sisters, of Satan's way sounds so logical and really so innocent. It is not!<br><br>The prophets are "watchmen on the tower" (see 2 Kings 9:17; D&amp;amp;C 101:45). They are seers. They have a mantle whereby they see what lies ahead, and they give warning to those wise enough to listen. In section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in speaking of His prophets, the Lord said this:<br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:38]<br><br>I would also say to you that when President Gordon B. Hinckley speaks, the other 14 men who we have sustained as prophets will be in harmony with him. You will not do well if you seek to find disagreement or contention among their other speeches-dev. I promise you that you will be disappointed if you seek to shop among them for justification for your opposition to the word of the Lord, and I hasten to warn you that you will stand alone when the day comes should you rebel against the prophets.<br><br>What we need today is not more prophets. What we need today is people with listening ears, people who can internalize, who can feel the words of the living prophets. We need more of us who are willing to keep the sacred covenants that we have made.<br><br>Now, you need to understand that this is our day. This is your time. We honor, as we should, our forefathers for their enormous sacrifices not just in the Church but in the cause of freedom, but I ask you, "Are we only the descendants of great men and women? Do we not have a part to play in the ongoing work of the Lord Jesus Christ?" The answer is, "Of course we do." And as our forefathers did not fail in their challenges, we must not fail in ours. They found the light and direction they needed in the living prophets of their day. We will find the light and direction we need in our day from the same source, even the living prophets of today.<br><br>I stand before you tonight in all solemnity as a witness that the Lord Jesus Christ lives and is directing His Church today. I stand further as a witness that there are living prophets among us. That we will have ears to hear is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>Too Wonderful for Me” - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is a scripture to which President Howard W. Hunter referred during the training of General Authorities at October conference 1992. I have written that statement in my scriptures in the margin. This is the scripture from Jeremiah 31:31–34:<br><br><i>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</i><br><br><i>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;...</i><br><br><i>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</i><br><br><i>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</i><br><br>It is my conviction that most of you will live to see that day. How can the great Jehovah put His law in our inward parts and write it in our hearts? Why will there no longer be a need to teach our neighbors? Why will He forgive our iniquity?<br><br>A year ago this coming April, President Packer, who, along with the Twelve Apostles, is responsible for the training of all of the General and Area Authorities, gave us counsel and direction that will lead to the fulfillment of the quote from Jeremiah. The training was the deepest and most meaningful of any I have experienced in my 29 years as a General Authority. It changed my life and, I would assume, the lives of all the Brethren. President Packer is a divine seer. He took the necessary preparation time and made the total effort required by the Lord to receive the direction necessary from the Lord. He read the books on Christ by Frederic William Farrar, possibly the most accurate biblical scholar outside of the Church. It is he and his writings that Elder James E. Talmage quotes in<i>Jesus the Christ</i>. Elder Bruce R. McConkie referred to his works often. President Packer read<i>The New Foxe's Book of Martyrs,</i>which I also picked up and read. The humiliation, suffering, and horror of the early Christians and the cruelty of the protesters is beyond our ability to comprehend. Most of the Christians were burned at the stake, had their flesh torn from them, were buried alive, or were put in dens with half-starved lions or tigers. These early Christians suffered the deepest, most penetrating pain possible, and almost to their dying breath called out to Jesus. It was as though they could already see Him. As I read stories of hundreds who suffered those horrific experiences, I wondered, and I hoped that if I were ever to be put in similar circumstances that I would suffer in the wonderful dignified way they did. I hope I would be strong enough to do that.<br><br>President Packer read<i>Jesus the Christ</i>again. He read every scripture about the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of God in the standard works. He pondered and prayed, and the revelation came. I am convinced it was not just to be lodged in the hearts of the Brethren but is revelation for the whole Church. I believe as General Authorities we are under the sacred and holy obligation to take the message to the Church. I believe you will hear more on this inspired subject in the days, months, and years ahead that will help and bless this Church more than anything else.<br><br>President Packer's message was that we must live worthy to have the Holy Ghost with us 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the rest of our lives. This was not a message for us only; it is a message for every member of the Church. Can you imagine what would happen if every man, woman, youth, and child lived in such a way as to qualify? We would startle the world. Imagine 11 million members of the Church now, and then 20, 50, 80, and 100 million in the future having the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>It is my belief that President Howard W. Hunter, quoting that wonderful scripture in Jeremiah, knew that in a future day not many years off President Packer would help us qualify for the fulfillment of this wonderful blessing.<br><br>The second revelation of absolute and profound importance came as he and the Twelve encouraged us to testify of the Living Christ. You have read the declaration of the Living Christ by President Hinckley, his counselors, and the Quorum of the Twelve. How often do we testify of the things we hold most precious and dear in this life? For some it may be occasionally--i.e., once a year or once in a while when we are called upon to speak or in a testimony meeting. We are true disciples of Christ; we ought to testify every day in every Latter-day Saint home to our wives/husbands, siblings, and children. These are the people we should love most on this earth. These are those we want to know the truth of this mighty work. Opportunities will come at school, in our work, and in the community to testify to our friends and neighbors not of our faith in a humble and sweet way, as well as to testify to each other and build greater faith.<br><br>For example, a son may say to us, "I sure think President Hinckley is a good man."<br><br>We could say, "Indeed, he is wonderful."<br><br>What if instead we said, "Son, I know he is a prophet of God, a seer, and a revelator. He may be one of the greatest prophets that ever lived."<br><br>Can you see the difference? Can you feel the difference?<br><br>A daughter might say, "We have a nice bishop."<br><br>We could respond, "Yes, sweetheart, he is."<br><br>What if we took this opportunity to say, "Sweetheart, he was called by God by revelation. He has the mantle upon him, and he is guided by inspiration in his calling."<br><br>Children need to hear their parents testify. Siblings can strengthen each other, and their friends can be lifted spiritually.<br><br>Can you think of anything in this generation that would affect members of the Church more than living to be worthy of the Holy Ghost constantly and testifying as guided and directed by the Holy Ghost of the truth of this great, majestic, divine work and more especially of Him whose work this is?<br><br>This is how we will put His law in our inward parts, and it will be written in our hearts. It is how our iniquity will be forgiven. Of course, when we live worthy of the Holy Ghost, it will have required repentance, submission, and meekness. Then we will have qualified, and then the Holy Ghost will inspire us to testify and forgiveness will come.<br><br>Section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants teaches us the reality of the possibility for every worthy member of this Church:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>The Savior said "every soul," not just the Brethren or specially privileged souls--every soul. Can you comprehend the power that would surge through the Church if every soul sought to seek the face of Christ and know that He is? Remember, the Lord's promises are sure.<br><br>In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord counsels us in this powerful declaration:<br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:38]<br><br>In D&amp;amp;C 18:36 the Lord teaches, "Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice." If ever I have heard the Lord's voice, it is in the declaration from D&amp;amp;C 1. There is a witness that penetrates my heart and soul that what the Lord states is truth. Like Jeremiah, I thrill that "his word [is] in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones" (Jeremiah 20:9).<br><br>This is the time to make a sacred resolution to follow the apostles and the prophets, to seek the Holy Ghost, and to testify and qualify to see the Master's face.<br><br>It has been my experience that fasting, prayer, study, and pondering are essential. Equally important is service. We must follow the pattern Christ modeled for us. King Benjamin said:<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>François-Auguste-René de Chateaubriand said: "In the days of service all things are founded; in the days of special privilege they deteriorate; and in the days of vanity they are destroyed."<br><br>Henry Drummond in an inverse way helps us to understand the attitude of many, both in and out of the Church:<br><br><i>I lived for myself, I thought for myself,</i><br><i>For myself, and none beside--</i><br><i>Just as if Jesus had never lived,<br>As if He had never died.</i><br><br>[<i>The Greatest Thing in the World</i>(New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, n.d.), 40]<br><br>No one can ignore Jesus the Christ. His name may be profaned. He may be treated lightly as of no consequence, but He cannot be ignored.<br><br><i>Napoleon Bonaparte, in speaking of the Savior, said: "Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I, myself, have founded great empires; but upon what did these creations of our genius depend? Upon force! Jesus alone founded His empire upon love; and to this very day millions would die for Him. I think I understand something of human nature; and I tell you all these were men, and I am a man. No other is like Him. Jesus Christ was more than a man. I have inspired multitudes with such an enthusiastic devotion that they would have died for me, but to do this, it was necessary that I should be visibly present with the electric influence of my looks, of my words, of my voice. Christ alone has succeeded in so raising the mind of man toward the Unseen that it becomes insensible to the barriers of time and space. Across a chasm of eighteen hundred years, He makes a demand which is beyond all others difficult to satisfy. He asks for the human heart. He will have it entirely to Himself. He demands it unconditionally, and forthwith His demand is granted. Wonderful! In defiance of time and space, the soul of man, with all its powers and faculties, becomes an annexation to the empire of Christ. All who sincerely believe in Him, experience that remarkable supernatural love toward Him. This phenomenon is unaccountable; it is altogether beyond the scope of man's creative powers. Time, the great destroyer, is powerless to extinguish this sacred flame; time can neither exhaust its strength, nor put a limit to its range. This is what strikes me most. I have often thought of it. This it is which proves to me quite convincingly the divinity of Jesus Christ."</i>[Julia A. Farnsworth Lund, "Thoughts Inspired by the Christmas Tide,"<i>Young Woman's Journal</i>11, no. 1 (January 1900): 24–25]<br><br>Napoleon could not ignore Him; neither can all the modern world leaders. By and by, all shall know Him, and the time will come when every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ, the king of heaven and earth. As Elder Maxwell has often witnessed, He is not "a one-planet God."<br><br>If we would be like Him, if we are going to be able to testify in His name and of Him, we must have the Holy Ghost as a constant, faithful companion. Even those who have left the kingdom or turned aside from it, those who may have put Him low on their list of priorities, are not lost.<br><br>Job witnessed:<br><br><i>For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</i><br><br><i>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</i><br><br><i>Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</i>[Job 14:7–9]<br><br>I believe that through the "scent" of our testimonies, they will return and bud again. Testifying may be more important to many who have lost their way than we would ever dare to suppose.<br><br>Your generation will live to see the fulfillment of all these things. Listen to the words of truth in this verse:<br><br><i>The Torch Bearer</i><br><br><i>The God of High Endeavor</i><br><i>Gave me a torch to bear.</i><br><i>I lifted it high above me</i><br><i>In the dark and murky air;</i><br><i>And straightway with loud hosannas</i><br><i>The crowd proclaimed its light</i><br><i>And followed me as I carried my torch</i><br><i>Through the starless night,</i><br><i>Till drunk with the people's praises</i><br><i>And mad with vanity</i><br><i>I forgot 'twas the torch that they followed<br>And fancied they followed me.</i><br><br><i>Then slowly my arm grew weary<br>Upholding the shining load</i><br><i>And my tired feet went stumbling</i><br><i>Over the dusty road.</i><br><i>And I fell with the torch beneath me.</i><br><i>In a moment the light was out.</i><br><i>When lo! from the throng a stripling</i><br><i>Sprang forth with a mighty shout,</i><br><i>Caught up the torch as it smoldered</i><br><i>And lifted it high again,</i><br><i>Till fanned by the winds of heaven<br>It fired the souls of men.</i><br><br><i>And as I lay in the darkness</i><br><i>The feet of the trampling crowd</i><br><i>Passed over and far beyond me,</i><br><i>Its paeans proclaimed aloud,</i><br><i>And I learned in the deepening twilight</i><br><i>The glorious verity,</i><br><i>'Tis the torch that the people follow,<br>Whoever the bearer may be.</i><br><br>[Author unknown, "The Torch Bearer,"<i>The Master of Men,</i>comp. Thomas Curtis Clark (Freeport, New York: Books for Libraries Press, 1930), 205–6]<br><br>Whenever I speak to those your age and younger, I always wonder: Are there those who are listening to me today who will be mothers of apostles and prophets, wives of these great leaders, mothers and wives of members of the Quorums of the Seventy, of temple presidents, mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops?<br><br>Are future apostles, prophets, and members of the Quorums of the Seventy, these great leaders who will direct the affairs of the kingdom, here today? Are those men who will preside over the Church, temples, missions, stakes, and wards here? Yes, I always know you are out there. I want to warn you as a watchman: Be careful, be wise, be clean and pure. You don't know who you are, but we do, and so does Lucifer. It will demand discipline, control, and purity if you will be called where you are foreordained. An unknown author makes this preliminary statement:<br><br><i>Expect to have your body cravings almost overwhelm you when you are alone. The narrowed perspective will be ever present to persuade you, your physical self, to gratify itself in spite of great things out there. Emotion is the king, right emotional relationships is the thing. Knowing this helps at times, but it doesn't bring a cure-all. ... You have to have a strategy for handling this temptation. Perhaps the most subtle of temptations come to us when we don't recognize them as bodily appetites pushing for overemphasis. However, in the very clash of ideas, if we hold up our side in the battle, the truth arises. Opposition in all things needs to be strengthened from the righteous side. We need to oppose evil with good in order for the truth to emerge. </i><br><br>We might look at temptation and say,as C. S. Lewis did with this unusual insight:<br><br><i>A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the</i>[opposing]<i>army by fighting against it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means--the only complete realist.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), 124–25, book 3, chapter 11, paragraph 7]<br><br>Now how does all of this apply to you? I promise you that once you commit your heart and soul to this wonderful work, you will have what Lloyd C. Douglas, author of<i>The Robe</i>, described as a "magnificent obsession."<br><br>I love this wonderful Church, not only for what it is but also for what it makes of us and of those around us.<br><br>There was a Filipino woman in Manila. I was standing in my office, and I looked down to see her walking on two very heavily calloused knees dragging two crippled legs behind her going to the temple. I called downstairs to Bishop Santos and asked him how long it would take him to find and buy a new wheelchair. He said it would take a little over an hour. I asked him, "Will you go out and buy a new wheelchair and take it over to the temple? You'll see a woman coming out walking on her knees. I'd like you to present it to her."<br><br>He left and came back with the wheelchair and put it behind a pillar of the temple. As the woman came out, he went up to her and asked, "Do you have a wheelchair?"<br><br>She began to weep and said, "No. I used to, but it wore out and fell apart. I'll never be able to afford another one as long as I live."<br><br>He replied, "How would you like a wheelchair?"<br><br>This wonderful woman cried. Bishop Santos went behind the pillar and pulled out the wheelchair, and they lifted her up into it. I watched as they wheeled her across the street to the patron housing.<br><br>About a week later Bishop Santos came to my office. He said, "President Featherstone, we have a request for 200,000 pesos from a branch president down on a distant island. A four-year-old boy has a brain tumor, and they don't know what to do. They went to a charity hospital, and he was put on a one-year waiting list. They went to the Catholic Church, and they said they couldn't help him. Then they remembered that two years before they had been baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They had only attended Church once--the Sunday they were baptized--and had never been back. But they were desperate, and they needed some help. Their branch president knows that we can't grant their request, but he needs an answer for them. What do you think?"<br><br>I said, "Let me look at the request." I read it, and then I said, "Bishop, if this was your son, we would do it, and if it was my son, we would do it. We're going to help this little boy." And I signed that request.<br><br>Bishop Santos, a wonderful Filipino, stood there with tears flowing down his cheeks and said, "President Featherstone, we belong to a wonderful and magnificent church."<br><br>I said, "Yes, Bishop, we do. We belong to a wonderful and magnificent church."<br><br>I was in Richfield and saw a good friend that I had met in San Antonio on my mission. His name is John. His eyesight is failing; he is almost blind. His family needed a car. He had bought an old van for, I believe, $200, and thought he could make it work. It didn't run. He bought parts--as many as he could afford. About three months later it still wasn't running. He really needed the money back out of the car, so he let it be known that he was selling it.<br><br>One of the good men there went to him and said, "John, I understand you're selling your car."<br><br>John answered, "Yes, I am."<br><br>The man asked, "How much do you want for it?"<br><br>John said, "Well, I'd really like to get what I have into it. I have $200 into it."<br><br>The man said, "Two hundred dollars, huh? Would you take $300 for it?"<br><br>Tears started glistening in John's eyes, and he said, "That would be wonderful."<br><br>Then the man said, "Well, then how about $400?"<br><br>Then the tears came a little faster.<br><br>"Okay. This is my final offer. I'll give you $500 for it."<br><br>God bless those kind of people! I'm so grateful for that kind of faith in the Church.<br><br>A Relief Society president was at dinner. Suddenly she jumped up and said, "I've got to go!"<br><br>Her husband asked, "Where are you going?"<br><br>She answered, "I can't tell you. I'll be back later."<br><br>She was gone for about an hour. When she came back, her husband asked, "What was that all about?"<br><br>She replied, "I had the strongest impression I had to go to the bishop's. I went over and knocked on the door. The bishop's wife came to the door, and I said, 'LaRae, I'm here. How can I help?'<br><br>"The tears flowed down her cheeks, and she put her head down on my shoulder and wept. She said, 'You know, everybody loves my husband. He's the bishop. They bear testimony about him on Sunday and talk about what a great man he is. I'm not sure anybody in the ward even knows I'm here, knows I exist, or even cares. I wondered even if God cared or knew I was here. So I knelt down and prayed, "Heavenly Father, if you know I'm here or even care, please let me know."'"<br><br>And there was a knock on the door, and the Relief Society president said, "I'm here. How can I help?"<br><br>Many years ago I was in Stockton, California, and a high councilor came up to me and said, "Elder Featherstone, I've been impressed by what you've said about the family. I have a son who is 17 years old. I haven't hugged him or told him I loved him for half of his life--not since he was eight years old. I'm going home today, and I'm going to hug him and tell him I love him."<br><br>I was afraid he might chicken out, so I asked him to write me a letter and tell me how it went. He wrote me a letter that arrived about three days later. Essentially, he said this, "I went home after Church. My son was watching a football game. He was slouched in the big easy chair with his leg up over the arm. I walked up to him, grabbed him by the arm, pulled him out of the chair, hugged him, kissed him on the cheek, and told him I loved him for the first time in half his life."<br><br>I read the letter as I sat in my office, and the tears ran down and splashed on the letter. Of course we love each other. Love is critical.<br><br>Years ago, way back when I was just about 11 or 12, I remember my father had received his paycheck on Wednesday and finally came home Friday night. Nothing was left. There wasn't any food in the house--at least very little. I had saved 67 cents for tithing. He took me by the hand and pulled me into his bedroom and said, "Vaughn, I understand you have 67 cents saved for tithing."<br><br>I said, "Yes, I do."<br><br>He said, "Vaughn, the Church doesn't need your money."<br><br>That was true. In those days you could buy a loaf of bread for 14 cents, a small loaf for a nickel, and you could buy a quart of milk for 14 cents. The money could have at least bought our family's supper.<br><br>So he said, "Vaughn, the Church doesn't need your money. It has millions of dollars."<br><br>That may have been true. Then he said, "Your brothers and sisters are hungry. We need that money for food. I want you to go get your money and give it to me."<br><br>I remember I stood there. I couldn't move. The tears came to my eyes. He was my father. I couldn't say no. But I couldn't move. I just stood there. I thought, "No, I'm not going to get it."<br><br>A second time, a little heavier, he said, "I'm telling you, go get your tithing money."<br><br>It was like my shoes were nailed to the floor. The tears came faster, and I didn't move again. He was a big man.<br><br>Then a third time, threateningly, he said, "I'm telling you, Vaughn, you go get the tithing money."<br><br>I remember standing there thinking, "I don't care if he beats me. I'm not going to give it to him. It's not my money. It's the Lord's money, and I'm not going to give it to him."<br><br>My mother must have heard part of the conversation, because she came in and grabbed me, pulled me out of the bedroom, and said, "You let the boy alone. If he wants to pay his tithing, he's going to pay his tithing."<br><br>I don't think I've missed paying tithing in all the years since.<br><br>Teilhard de Chardin said:<br><br><i>The day will come when, after harnessing</i>[space],<i>the winds, the tides, gravitation, we shall harness for God the energies of love. And, on that day, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.</i>[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, "The Evolution of Chastity,"<i>Toward the Future,</i>trans. René Hague (San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975), 86–87]<br><br>That is what this gospel is all about. You have some wonderful things to do in preparation. Enjoy the process of preparing for celestial marriage. Be excited and energetic, and be careful.<br><br>One man who once stood in a high place in the Church is now no longer a member. He has lost everything that is precious and dear. His brother wrote to him, trying to persuade him back. In so doing, he shared with him this quote from Shakespeare's<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>(1594). It is a warning to all of us. The villainous Tarquin says:<br><br><i>What win I if I gain the thing I seek?</i><br><i>A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.</i><br><i>Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?</i><br><i>Or sells eternity to get a toy?</i><br><i>For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?</i><br><i>Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,<br>Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?</i><br>[lines 211–17]<br><br>Then follow the words from poor Lucrece:<br><br><i>Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,</i><br><i>Thy private feasting to a public fast,<br>Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name.</i><br>[lines 890–92]<br><br>These words could not describe more accurately this fallen priesthood leader.<br><br>You will want beauty in your life, not sorrow and heartache.

Strive as you may,</i><br><i>You cannot miss it in your way.</i><br><i>All paths that have been, or shall be,<br>Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>All those who journey, soon or late,</i><br><i>Must pass within the garden's gate;</i><br><i>Must kneel alone in darkness there,</i><br><i>And battle with some fierce despair.</i><br><i>God pity those who can not say,</i><br><i>"Not mine but thine," who only pray,</i><br><i>"Let this cup pass," and cannot see<br>The</i>purpose<i>in Gethsemane.</i><br>[Ella Wheeler Wilcox,<i>Poems of Power</i>(Chicago: W. B. Conkey Company, 1901), 147–48; emphasis in original]<br><br>Yes, we will all have our personal Gethsemane-type experiences, but that is okay. It is what life is all about. Along with the problems that drive you to Gethsemane, there will be the mountain peaks of joy that will compensate for every moment of innocent suffering. If you are faithful, the time will come when you will have merited this that I promise.<br><br><i>And now the year of my redeemed is come; and they shall mention the loving kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his goodness, and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:52]<br><br>And if you are honest and gracious, you will exclaim as did Job: "Therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not" (Job 42:3).<br><br>We had a son, Joe, who was at the Alpine Slide. He was up at the top with the children, bringing them down the slide, and his mother was waiting down at the bottom. She saw a woman at the side fumbling in the grass looking for something. She went over and asked if she could help her find something. Apparently the woman had lost the lens cap off her camera and was looking for it. Merlene got down and helped her. The woman spoke in very broken English. Merlene said, "You're not from the United States. Are you from Mexico?"<br><br>The woman said, "No, I'm from Ecuador."<br><br>Merlene asked, "What are you doing here from Ecuador?"<br><br>The woman answered, "I have come to find the beloved missionary who baptized me into the Church. I will love him as long as time lasts."<br><br>Merlene said, "How long ago were you baptized?"<br><br>The woman said, "About 20 years."<br><br>Merlene told her, "We have a son who served about 20 years ago in Ecuador. I'll bet he'll know him. What was the elder's name?"<br><br>She answered, "Well, it was a peculiar name: Elder Joseph Featherstone."<br><br>Merlene said, "Come on over to the bottom of the slide. I want to introduce you to someone."<br><br>About that time Joe came down the slide. He saw his mother standing there with a woman he didn't recognize. As he got closer, he did recognize her. They ran and fell on each other's necks, but they couldn't speak because their hearts were full.<br><br>It is my testimony that the Holy Ghost and testifying should be our foundation pillars of direction as we move into the new millennium. Along with the prophet Job, I say, These are things I understand not that were "too wonderful for me."<br><br>We belong to a wonderful and magnificent church. I bear my solemn and absolute witness that the Book of Mormon is true, that Christ is the Savior of the world, that this church is His true and living church, that God our Father is the Lord Omnipotent, that we are His children, that He loves us and answers our prayers, however humble. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>rine and Covenants—The Capstone of Our Religion - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Charles Dickens began his famous story of<i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>with these words:<br><br><i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, . . . it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.</i><br><br>I would imagine that could be said of all periods of time. This is a wonderful time to be alive! As I witness the marvelous strides mankind is making today, I sometimes wish that I was your age. With the pace at which man is progressing, the Lord seems to be preparing us to accomplish much more as we wind up this final period of man's mortal experience. Of course, it could be said it is the worst of times because most of mankind has not embraced the gospel of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>It is evident from the signs of the times that the Lord is directing the destiny of His children here on earth. For example, there has been a significant change in the growth of the world's population. At the end of the first millennium following our Savior's birth, the world's population was only 300 million. During the next 800 years to the time of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the population had grown to one billion--or 700,000,000 more during those 800 years. Today the world's population is over 6.2 billion--5.2 billion added in the last 200 years.<br><br>In the post-Restoration period, the Lord has sent billions more of His children to the earth to hear His gospel. To facilitate this teaching, He has opened the minds of His children that they might bring forth an abundance of technologies to improve our ability to travel, communicate, and carry the gospel to the world.<br><br>Prior to the beginning of the 19th century, travel was much as it had been anciently--by foot, by domestic animal, and by ship on waterways. Communication was by word of mouth and very little written. After 1,800 years of sluggish development, it was as if a bright light was turned on to illuminate the minds of mankind, and suddenly the fields of transportation and communication moved forward with a new and exciting pace.<br><br>For example, in 1803 Fulton invented the steamboat. In 1814 Stevenson developed the steam locomotive. In 1819 Napier, the flatbed cylinder press. In 1837 Morse, the telegraph. In 1845 the oceanic cable was laid. In 1876 Bell, the telephone. In 1880 Edison, the electric light. In 1893 Ford, the automobile. And in 1903 the Wright brothers flew their first airplane. Since that time there has been an explosion of developments that have improved our abilities to travel and communicate, making most parts of the world accessible via travel or by electronic means.<br><h2><b>The Value of Scripture</b></h2><br>To me, the most significant evidence of the Lord's concern for His children is the way He has provided communication channels to direct us in the path He would like us to follow. We have the scriptures.<br><br>I marvel at how these wondrous stories of God's dealings with His children here on earth were preserved through the ages. The records were kept on tablets of clay or stone; they were written on metal plates, on leather scrolls, and, of course, papyrus discovered by the Egyptians about the time Abraham was on the earth. I marvel that great and stalwart leaders like Jerome, Wycliffe, and Tyndale accumulated the writings of the ancient prophets and were able to put them in an accessible form even though the ability to make records was so crude in that time. Sometimes they even gave up their lives to preserve what we have today.<br><br>We find the Lord communicating with His children from the very beginning. After Adam and Eve had been driven out of the Garden of Eden, we find this great account of the Lord instructing them:<br><br><i>And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.</i><br><br><i>And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i><br><br><i>And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.</i><br><br><i>And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i><br><br><i>And Adam and Eve blessed the name of God, and they made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.</i>[Moses 5:4–12]<br><br>Thus from the time of the Creation we have the beautiful scriptures that lay a pattern to guide us through mortality. We learn our beginnings through the story of Adam and Eve. An article in the<i>Ensign</i>some years ago enlarged my understanding of the very important role Adam played in the creation of the earth. Actually Adam's role in the eternal plan of God began in our premortal first estate, and the fact that he became the first inhabitant tells us of the eminence of his premortal status. It was part of the plan that he and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit. President Joseph Fielding Smith said: "He partook of that fruit for one good reason, and that was to open the door to bring you and me and everyone else into this world" (in Conference Report, October 1967, 121).<br><br>Adam continues to play an important role in the postmortal spirit world and will until the time of the Resurrection.<br><br>It is in the Old Testament that we learn of Father Abraham and his willingness to sacrifice his son if the Lord required him to do so. In all things he set the example of faithfulness to the Lord. Through Abraham's "seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice" (Genesis 22:18).<br><br>And don't you love the story of Joseph with his marvelous lesson! He had quite a life--being a favored son, a slave, a prisoner, and ultimately ruler over the land of Egypt. Pharaoh said, "Only in the throne will I be greater than thou" (Genesis 41:40). This because he was "a man in whom the Spirit of God is" (Genesis 41:38).<br><br>Then there was Moses. He was given an impossible assignment to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, where they had been in bondage for over 400 years. Elder Mark E. Petersen said:<br><br><i>The true Moses was one of the mightiest men of God in all time. . . .</i><br><br><i>He walked and talked with God. . . .</i><br><br><i>He saw the mysteries of the heavens and much of creation, and received laws from God beyond any other ancient man of whom we have record.</i>[<i>Moses: Man of Miracles</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1977), 49]<br><br>In the Old Testament we learn of great and noble women, such as Eve, Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, Rachel, Hannah, and many others. The book of Ruth tells us of Ruth's life and of her devotion to righteous principles. She was a true convert to Jehovah and, after losing her husband, chose to remain with her mother-in-law, Naomi, that "thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16). Ruth later married Boaz, and they became the parents of a noble posterity including King David, Mary, and the Messiah.<br><br>Esther is also from a book of the Old Testament. She was of Jewish descent and found favor with the king and became his queen without revealing her kindred. Later, when the lives of her people were threatened, she risked her own life to save them. They were saved because of her faith and that of her people.<br><br>The New Testament is just what the title page tells us. It is the New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Here we may come to know of the events of His life, His lineage, and His miraculous though humble birth. The New Testament does not reveal a great deal about the early years of preparation of His ministry, but in Luke we read: "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52).<br><br>We learn of His teachings--His example, His love, His knowledge, His power, His judgment, His kindness, His mercy, His patience. Moreover, we learn of His suffering at Gethsemane, His agony on the cross, His death, then His Resurrection. He made the ultimate sacrifice for us, not only losing His life but, in doing so, atoning for our sins. Most of all He has shown us the way, and we need to learn of Him that we may become "perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>I marvel that the Lord's dealings with His prophets have been preserved through all ages of time in these great scriptures. The materials on which the words were written were not of permanent quality. To preserve them from generation to generation, they had to be copied over and over to keep them from the destructive forces of nature. The repeated copying by the scribes led to mistranslations and omissions. Nephi warned us, "For behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away" (1 Nephi 13:26).<br><h2><b>A New Witness: The Book of Mormon</b></h2><br>However, because of the various translations and the difficulty in producing the translations, the Lord saw fit at the time of the Restoration to bring forth a new witness of His mission. We have the great blessing of the Book of Mormon that is another testament of Jesus Christ. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith told us, "The Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (Book of Mormon introduction; also<i>HC</i>4:461).<br><br>There were prophets who summarized on the pages the things that men must do in order to gain the fulness of salvation. Those who believe the witness it bears and obey the doctrines it teaches will be led to further light and knowledge revealed in our day and to the mysteries that the believing Saints alone can receive.<br><br>I marvel at the account of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith's prophetic call was to bring forth this great publication. It was in the year of 1823, at the age of 17, that he was shown the hidden records by the angel Moroni. After several visitations over the next four years, Joseph Smith was allowed to remove the sacred record that had rested at the Hill Cumorah near Palmyra, New York.<br><br>When Joseph went to the hill on the 22nd day of September 1827, the angel instructed him in matters pertaining to his sacred duty. At last the time arrived for the delivery of the plates and the Urim and Thummim and the breastplate to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He finally had them in his possession. The Prophet commenced the translation very slowly and methodically. He needed a scribe. In February of 1828 Martin Harris went to his home. Martin had been impressed with the stories he had heard about the Prophet having the gold plates. He acted as scribe from the 12th of April 1828 until he finally convinced the Prophet that he be allowed to take the record and show it to a few people to convince them that the work he was doing was important.<br><br>Permission was finally granted to him on the 14th day of June. Of course we know that that part of the record was lost. Joseph was soundly rebuked and warned against yielding to temptation. The records were taken from him for a season to give him time to repent. It was a bitter lesson for the young prophet, but it was necessary to prepare him for the great responsibility that was ahead of him. Sometime during the fall of the year 1828, the record was back in his hands, but once again he needed a scribe. It was on the 5th day of April 1829 that a young schoolteacher named Oliver Cowdery went to the home of the Prophet and inquired about his work. On the 7th day of April, Oliver Cowdery started acting as scribe to the Prophet. As the history records, the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery spent long hours together dictating the translation without reference to any books, papers, or manuscripts. After they would take a break, the Prophet would return and resume the dictation where the previous segment had ended.<br><br>As we examine the record, it is clear that Joseph Smith could not be the author of the Book of Mormon. The marvel of the whole translation was the rapidity with which the Book of Mormon was translated. It required only 85 days from the seventh day of April--the date Oliver Cowdery commenced acting as scribe--until the end of June, when the complete text was finished and ready to turn over to the printer.<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants gives us evidence of the power of translation of the Prophet Joseph Smith as contained in section 20, verses 8–12:<br><br><i>And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate the Book of Mormon;</i><br><br><i>Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also;</i><br><br><i>Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is declared unto the world by them--</i><br><br><i>Proving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old;</i><br><br><i>Thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and forever.</i><br><h2><b>The Capstone: The Doctrine and Covenants</b></h2><br>This was not the end, for in the ninth article of faith we read: "We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God."<br><br>The Lord continues to inspire His holy prophets to make a record of His dealings with them. In our time we have another scripture--not one of ancient origin, as are the Bible and the Book of Mormon, but one that has come forth in our time, one contained in the book of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson, in explaining the Doctrine and Covenants, put it this way:<br><br><i>The Doctrine and Covenants brings men to Christ's kingdom, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:30].<i>I know that.</i><br><br><i>The Book of Mormon is the "keystone" of our religion, and the Doctrine and Covenants is the capstone, with continuing latter-day revelation. The Lord has placed His stamp of approval on both the keystone and the capstone.</i>[In Conference Report, April 1987, 105; or "The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1987, 83]<br><br>The keystone and the capstone teach us about the cornerstone of our religion, which is the Savior.<br><br>Shortly after the organization of the Church, the members were desirous of obtaining copies of the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith up to that time. In the summer of 1830, the Prophet by divine command commenced to copy and prepare the revelations, no doubt with the thought in mind of having them published. Some of the elders were carrying copies in their pockets, so far as the Lord would permit them, for there were some of the revelations that were forbidden to be published to the world.<br><br>On the first and second of November 1831, a conference was held at Hiram, Ohio, when it was decided that the revelations should be compiled and published. On the first day of the conference the Lord gave approval to the plan by giving a revelation He called His "preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 1:6).<br><br>During the course of the conference there was not perfect harmony among the brethren. A few criticized the language found in the revelations. They forgot that the Lord uses men as instruments as they are available, through whom He communicates, just as an author when writing makes use of whatever pen, paper, or ink he may be able to obtain to produce his work. Some of the brethren did not fully realize that divine revelation is independent from university study, and they were wavering in their faith. In answer to this inquiry, the Lord issued a challenge:<br><br><i>Now, seek ye out of the Book of Commandments, even the least that is among them, and appoint him that is the most wise among you;</i><br><br><i>Or, if there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye are justified in saying that ye do not know that they are true;</i><br><br><i>But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye do not bear record that they are true.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 67:6–8]<br><br>William E. McLellin accepted the offer and undertook to initiate the revelations of the Lord. His efforts to produce a revelation were witnessed with great interest by the elders assembled, and when they were aware of his complete failure, all doubts concerning the revelations of God vanished. They were then willing to testify to the truth and signed a document containing their testimonies and witnesses to the truthfulness of the book.<br><br>Following the testimonies of the brethren, the conference authorized the publication of the revelations as the Book of Commandments. On the 12th day of November 1831, the Lord called John Whitmer, the Church historian and recorder, to accompany Oliver Cowdery, who had been commanded to carry the manuscripts to Missouri for printing.<br><br>On the 20th of November 1831, Oliver and John started for Missouri, arriving in Independence on the 5th of January 1832 after a long, cold journey. In June, Elder W. W. Phelps, who had the printing press of the Church in Independence, Missouri, began publishing extracts from the revelations in the<i>Evening and Morning Star</i>and setting the type for the Book of Commandments. The work on the press was slow and tedious.<br><br>Material for covers for the book was lacking but proved to be unnecessary. On the night of July 23, 1833, a mob broke into the establishment, carrying away the press and destroying the type and burning most of the papers and printed matter. One of the elders working on the publication, seeing the mob at the front door, hastily snatched an armload of assembled sheets of the Book of Commandments, found his way out the rear door, and buried them beneath the hay in an old barn. Then, fearing that he had been seen with his burden and that the copies might be found and destroyed, he loaded his arms with some bricks he found in the barn and in broad view started off in another direction. The ploy apparently worked, for as night came upon the city, at least 20 copies of the Book of Commandments had been preserved, but the publication of the Book of Commandments was effectively stopped.<br><br>In September of 1834, the First Presidency was appointed to select the revelations to be published, and the Prophet revised some of them from the original Book of Commandments to correct some of the printing errors and add additional information and some revelations received since 1833. The committee's work was completed the following summer, and a solemn assembly was convened on the 17th day of August 1835 to vote on the new book of scriptures to be called the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>The preface of the Doctrine and Covenants introduces the message of the book:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i><br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</i><br><br><i>And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.</i><br><br><i>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</i><br><br><i>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:1–7]<br><br>Then verses 37–39:<br><br><i>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</i><br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i><br><br><i>For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever.</i><br><br>The entire book of scripture stands as a warning to the nations that God will not be mocked. Those who heed the voice of warning will find protection and peace, but those who refuse it will reap bitter fruit. President Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>This Doctrine and Covenants</i>[is not a book just for the Latter-day Saints. It is more than that. It]<i>belongs to all the world, to the Catholics, to the Presbyterians, to the Methodists, to the infidel, to the non-believer. It is his book if he will accept it. . . . The Lord has given it unto the world for their salvation. If you do not believe it, you read the first section in this book, the preface, and you will find that the Lord has sent this book and the things which it contains unto the people afar off, on the islands of the sea, in foreign lands, and his voice is unto all people, that all may hear. And so I say it belongs to all the world, not only to the Latter-day Saints, and they will be judged by it, and you will be judged by it.</i>[In Conference Report, October 1919, 146]<br><br>Joseph Fielding Smith also said:<br><br><i>In my judgment there is no book on earth yet come to man as important as the book known as the Doctrine and Covenants, with all due respect to the Book of Mormon, and the Bible, and the Pearl of Great Price, which we say are our standards in doctrine. The book of Doctrine and Covenants to us stands in a peculiar position above them all.</i><br><br><i>I am going to tell you why. When I say that, do not for a moment think I do not value the Book of Mormon, the Bible, and the Pearl of Great Price, just as much as any man that lives; I think I do. I do not know of anybody who has read them more, and I appreciate them; they are wonderful; they contain doctrine and revelation and commandments that we should heed; but the Bible is a history containing the doctrine and commandments given to the people anciently. That applies also to the Book of Mormon. It is the doctrine and the history and the commandments of the people who dwelt upon this continent anciently.</i><br><br><i>But this Doctrine and Covenants contains the word of God to those who dwell here now. It is our book. It belongs to the Latter-day Saints. More precious than gold, the Prophet says we should treasure it more than the riches of the whole earth. I wonder if we do? If we value it, understand it, and know what it contains, we will value it more than wealth; it is worth more to us than the riches of the earth.</i>[<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 3:198–99]<br><br>The explanatory introduction gives us wonderful insight to what is contained in this collection of divine revelations and inspired declarations on the establishment and regulation of the kingdom of God on earth in the latter days. Now let me quote from two of the paragraphs in the explanatory introduction:<br><br><i>The book of Doctrine and Covenants is one of the standard works of the Church in company with the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Pearl of Great Price. However, the Doctrine and Covenants is unique because it is not a translation of an ancient document, but is of modern origin and was given of God through his chosen prophets for the restoration of his holy work and the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth in these days. In the revelations one hears the tender but firm voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, speaking anew in the dispensation of the fulness of times; and the work that is initiated herein is preparatory to his second coming, in fulfillment of and in concert with the words of all the holy prophets since the world began.</i><br><br>Then, in the next-to-last paragraph, it states:<br><br><i>In the revelations the doctrines of the gospel are set forth with explanations about such fundamental matters as the nature of the Godhead, the origin of man, the reality of Satan, the purpose of mortality, the necessity for obedience, the need for repentance, the workings of the Holy Spirit, the ordinances and performances that pertain to salvation, the destiny of the earth, the future conditions of man after the resurrection and the judgment, the eternity of the marriage relationship, and the eternal nature of the family. Likewise the gradual unfolding of the administrative structure of the Church is shown with the calling of bishops, the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Seventy, and the establishment of other presiding offices and quorums. Finally, the testimony that is given of Jesus Christ--his divinity, his majesty, his perfection, his love, and his redeeming power--makes this book of great value to the human family and of more worth than the riches of the whole earth.</i><br><br>Thus we see how carefully the Lord is preparing every detail to carry out the full plan He has designed for the guidance of His children on their journey through mortality. The population growth indicates He is sending many more of His spirit children to earth to have a mortal experience. Technology makes travel and communication accessible to all corners of the earth, and, most important, He is protecting and preserving His holy scriptures for our guidance.<br><br>My encouragement to you tonight is to study the doctrines of the Lord's Church. With all the mountains of information being fed to the world today, how comforting it is to know that the Lord has preserved His dealings with His children as contained in His holy scriptures. Here is our foundation of truth. It will stand the test of time. It is the doctrine and His revealed covenants we must take upon ourselves that will lead us back to His presence. It is the only course that will lead to life eternal, which is surely the objective of each of us. This is my witness to you in the name of our Lord and Savior, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>g the Arts in Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
How fortunate we are to sing "Our Savior's Love" this morning. Two former members of the faculty, Crawford Gates and Edward Hart, collaborated in its creation. And how wonderful it is to be taught and edified by this superb Men's Choir. To be reminded of the love and mission of Jesus Christ so vividly through music is truly a blessing. The music performed as we entered this facility quietly prepared our minds and hearts to receive this blessing. I am grateful for music and for all of the arts, for they give meaning and richness to life.<br><h2><b>A Unique Institution</b></h2><br>We are privileged to be associated with Brigham Young University. It was no idle dream that brought Brigham Young Academy into existence 125 years ago. Its founders had a clear vision of its destiny. We are here today because of their courage and sacrifice.<br><br>This year the College of Fine Arts and Communications is celebrating another important event: the 75th anniversary of the founding of the College of Fine Arts. The Department of Communications was added to the college about 35 years later. In a number of ways, and on varied occasions, we are honoring those who established a foundation for the arts and communications at BYU. As a special tribute to those faithful founders, I have chosen to speak about centering the arts in Christ.<br><br>It is a rare blessing to be associated with an institution that honors the central role of Jesus Christ in this world's destiny. It was faith in Christ that motivated the founders of this institution. And that same faith guided those who established the arts as a core element of our curriculum. They followed the Light that leads all mankind toward things that are "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Most were also responding to the quiet invitation of the Holy Ghost to center the arts in Christ. In Mormon's words:<br><br><i>I judge these things of</i>[them]<i>because of</i>[their]<i>peaceable walk with the children of men.</i><br><br><i>For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also.</i>[Moroni 7:4–5]<br><h2><b>Our Challenge</b></h2><br>I offer my profound gratitude to all those faithful, sensitive women and men who loved beauty and truth enough to sacrifice their lives in service at this institution.<br><br>It is now our challenge to strengthen and extend their artistic work into the 21st century and beyond. Will we be willing to place Christ at the center of our work?<br><br>During the ministry of Jesus in Palestine, there were many who "believed on him; but ... did not confess him, ... for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God" (John 12:42–43). The same challenge exists today. Do we believe in Christ but fail to follow Him because we love the praise of men more than the praise of God? Or are we willing to follow Him but uncertain about what that means? "Behold I am the light," He assured the Nephite faithful. "I have set an example for you" (3 Nephi 18:16). What was that example?<br><br>• Christ loved and obeyed His Father (see Matthew 26:39; John 5:19, 30).<br><br>• He understood who He really was (see John 10:7–15; 13:3).<br><br>• Jesus prayed often and studied the scriptures (see Matthew 14:23; Luke 4:4; 24:27).<br><br>• He taught His followers about the Holy Ghost and urged them to seek and heed the Spirit's guidance (see John 14:16–26).<br><br>• He invited His followers to consecrate their lives to the work of God through serving others (see Matthew 19:16–26).<br><br>• Our Savior encouraged all to repent and to freely forgive others (see Matthew 5–7; 18:21–22; Luke 15:11–32).<br><br>• Christ challenged His followers to reach their full potential (see Matthew 13:10–13).<br><br>• He openly expressed love, compassion, understanding, and appreciation (see Matthew 9:36; 20:34; 26:6–13).<br><br>• He gave His life so others could return to His Father's presence (see John 3:16–17; John 17; 2 Nephi 2:8; Mormon 9:13).<br><br>• Jesus ministered personally, getting to know people by walking and working among them (see Matthew 4:23–24; 3 Nephi 18:31).<br><br>• He did not condescend to others, even though He was the only perfect mortal (see Luke 19:2–9; John 4:6–42).<br><br>• Our Redeemer respected individual agency, taught true principles, encouraged self-governance, and provided an opportunity to account for personal thoughts and actions (see Matthew 10).<br><br>• He condemned sin without condemning the sinner and ministered to both the repentant and the unrepentant alike (see John 8:3–11).<br><br>• Jesus lifted the downtrodden and gave hope to the discouraged (see John 16:33; 3 Nephi 1:10–13).<br><br>• He blessed the sick and cared for the poor (see 3 Nephi 17:7–25; Mark 2 and 5).<br><br>If we desire to center the arts in Christ, we will follow His example. He asked the Nephite disciples, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" And He answered His own question ever so simply: "Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). More precisely, He said, "I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48). He invites us to be like Him! Not just to believe in Him, but to be like Him--to acquire, in process of time, His righteous attributes.<br><br>If we seek to center the arts in Christ, will our artistic endeavors differ from those of others? If so, in what ways will they differ? How might our efforts also parallel the work of others? For what purposes should followers of Christ use the arts? Must they be willing to depart from some of the world's artistic traditions? If so, will that limit their creative energies or liberate them? Such is the nature of the questions that confront those who would follow Christ.<br><h2><b>What Are the Arts?</b></h2><br>What are the arts, really? Are they subjects, professions, cultural artifacts, or events to attend? Yes, but that is not what they really are. The arts embody a unique learning process that awakens the very core of one's being to life's meaning and beauty. Through the arts we can learn to see, hear, move, and feel with greater sensitivity and understanding. They provide both substance and stimulus for learning the creative process and nurture our capacity to explore the infinite. The arts enable us to communicate important realities that can be shared in no other way. Elder Boyd K. Packer has affirmed that "because of what [artists] do, we are able to feel and learn very quickly ... some spiritual things that we would otherwise learn very slowly" (Boyd K. Packer, "The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1976, 61).<br><br>We separate the arts, perhaps to better understand them. But learning processes called music, drama, painting, sculpture, dance, poetry, literature, or film are really parts of a greater whole. They encompass an approach to learning and knowing that is unique. The arts must be an essential core component of a balanced education.<br><br>The arts are also a marvelous manifestation of "the light of Christ," for<br><br><i>the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;</i><br><br><i>Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space--</i><br><br><i>The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:7, 11–13]<br><br>The creative flame that ignites artistic creation has its origin in "the light which is in all things." Christ is the source of the power that is within us whereby we exercise "free will, and bring to pass much righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28). His light gives life to our creative potential. His love impels us to creative action. Art itself appears because there is a spark of the divine nature in God's children.<br><br>Those who remove themselves from the Light of Christ through pride or disobedience may use the "form" of art to express themselves, but "they deny the power thereof" (Joseph Smith--History 1:19). Technical skill becomes the substance of their work because they are unable to receive the power that would give it life and meaning. In contrast, those who seek to follow Christ are free to receive the enlightenment and pure joy that flows through art centered in Him. We are "that [we] might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). Art centered in Christ immerses us in joy!<br><h2><b>There Are Two Ways</b></h2><br>There is a difference between art that comes through the Light of Christ and art that comes from the devil and those "who subject themselves unto him" (Moroni 7:17). That difference is not difficult to define. But the devil's enticements can be convincing, even to those who should know better. Christ has warned us<br><br><i>that there are many spirits which are false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world.</i><br><br><i>And also Satan hath sought to deceive you, that he might overthrow you. ...</i><br><br><i>Behold, ... there are hypocrites among you, who have deceived some, which has given the adversary power.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:2–3, 7]<br><br>"Wherefore, take heed," the prophet Mormon adds, "that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil" (Moroni 7:14).<br><br>Ezekiel charged us to "teach ... the difference between the holy and profane, and cause [people] to discern between the unclean and the clean" (Ezekiel 44:23). It may be instructive to review a few of the contrasts between art that has Christ at the center and forms of art created by deceivers or hypocrites.<br><br><i>Art That Is Centered in Christ</i><br><br>1. "Inviteth and enticeth to do good continually, ... to love God, and to serve him" (Moroni 7:13).<br><br>2. Persuades us "to believe in Christ" (Moroni 7:16).<br><br>3. Seeks the welfare of Zion through service motivated by the pure love of Christ (see 2 Nephi 26:29–31).<br><br>4. Plants joy in the hearts of those who are seeking to be like Christ (see 2 Nephi 2:25).<br><br>5. Is virtuous and full of charity toward all men (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>6. Radiates light and is filled with hope (see Moroni 7:48).<br><br>7. Is born of meekness and lowliness of heart. The pure love of Christ is its driving force (see Moroni 7:44–47; 8:25–26).<br><br>8. Invites "the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love" (Moroni 8:26).<br><br>9. Is created by those who, through faith in Christ, "shall have the power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in [Him]" (Moroni 7:33).<br><br>10. Is miraculous in its manifestation of beauty and love.<br><br>11. Those who create it desire to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny [themselves] of all ungodliness; ... and love God with all [their] might, mind and strength ... , that by his grace [they] may be perfect in Christ" (Moroni 10:32).<br><br>12. Is manifest according to the power of the Holy Ghost (see 2 Nephi 32:2–5).<br><br><i>Forms of Art Created by the Great Deceiver</i><br><br>1. "Inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually" (Moroni 7:12).<br><br>2. Persuades us "to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God" (Moroni 7:17).<br><br>3. Sets the artist up as a light to the world for the purpose of getting "gain and praise of the world" (2 Nephi 26:29).<br><br>4. Offends the sensibilities of those who are seeking to be perfected in Christ (see Matthew 16:23).<br><br>5. Is profane, corrupt, vulgar, violent, and blasphemous (see Ephesians 4:22, 29; Moses 8:28–30).<br><br>6. Is dark and hopeless (see D&amp;amp;C 10:20–21).<br><br>7. Is born of pride and selfishness. Money is its driving force (see 2 Nephi 26:29, 31).<br><br>8. Is strong in "perversion; and [those who create it] delight in everything save that which is good. ... They are without principle, and past feeling" (Moroni 9:19–20).<br><br>9. Is created by those who walk "in [their] own way, and after the image of [their] own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16).<br><br>10. Is made to appear wonderful, even though it embodies darkness and sin.<br><br>11. Those who create it "do withdraw [themselves] from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in [them] to guide [them] in wisdom's paths. [They] cometh out in open rebellion against God; ... listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in [them], for he dwelleth not in unholy temples" (Mosiah 2:36–37).<br><br>12. Is manifest according to the power of the devil (see Jacob 7:4).<br><br>Such are the contrasts that exist between the work of Christ and the work of the deceiver and his followers. There is no middle ground. There is also a simple test. Art that is centered in Christ invites the Holy Ghost to be present during its creation and, again, as it is experienced by others in performance, exhibition, or publication. Satan's counterfeit has no such power (see Moses 1:12–21).<br><h2><b>"The Difference Between God and the Devil"</b></h2><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has provided additional insight:<br><br><i>Our model--our first priority--is Jesus Christ. We must testify of him and teach one another how we can apply his teachings and his example in our lives.</i><br><br><i>Brigham Young gave us some practical advice on how to do this. "The difference between God and the Devil," he said, "is that God creates and organizes, while the whole study of the Devil is to destroy" (</i>Discourses of Brigham Young,<i>p. 69). ...</i><br><br><i>Remember, our Savior, Jesus Christ, always builds us up and never tears us down. We should apply the power of that example in the ways we use our time, including our recreation and diversions. Consider the themes of the books, magazines, movies, television, and music we make popular by our patronage. ...</i><br><br><i>The powerful idea in this example is that whatever builds people up serves the cause of the Master, and whatever tears people down serves the cause of the adversary.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Powerful Ideas,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 26–27]<br><h2><b>A Personal Remembrance</b></h2><br>Allow me to share a personal experience that may help illustrate the power and purpose of artistic experience centered in Christ. Many years ago, unable to sleep because of pressing problems, I sought the boredom of late-night television as a substitute for "counting sheep." Alone in the family room, I tuned to an educational channel just as a rather curious dance production was beginning. It was the story of the prodigal son retold through the music and choreography of Israeli collaborators and performed by an Israeli dance company. I expected this to be the perfect way to fall asleep. How wrong I was!<br><br>As the familiar story unfolded through movement and music, the simplicity and power of the production increasingly moved me. Every expression and movement had meaning. The camera's ever-changing focus absolutely held me spellbound. The music touched my heart and filled it with wonder. The movements of the dancers, now transformed into actors, opened the eyes of my understanding. I observed that the Holy Ghost had an overpowering presence in my being. As the story reached the point of the son's return to his father, the son crawled to his father's feet, writhing in the agony of true repentance. At just the right moment, his father lovingly lifted him into his arms and held him in an attitude of total forgiveness. In an instant I felt and understood the reality of the Atonement with such intensity that I wept in both joy and sorrow. It was a powerful and precious experience in my life, an experience made possible through artists who had responded to the Light of Christ in this collaborative creative endeavor.<br><h2><b>The Song of the Righteous</b></h2><br>The Lord has counseled us to "pray always, and [He] will pour out [His] Spirit upon [us]" (D&amp;amp;C 19:38). He has also affirmed that He delights "in the song of the heart [and that] the song of the righteous is a prayer unto [Him that] shall be answered with a blessing upon [our] heads" (D&amp;amp;C 25:12). We should recognize that because heartfelt singing is similar to heartfelt prayer, the blessing promised the righteous singer is the presence of His Spirit. Singing, whether with the voice or through the aid of a musical instrument, can provide a conduit to spiritual enrichment for those who are seeking with real intent to purify their lives. This promised blessing characterizes the blessing available to the righteous through the arts.<br><br>With that idea in mind, let's sing another hymn together. As we do so, sing from and with your heart. Forget about what others around you may think and immerse yourself completely in the text and music. Approach this hymn as you might approach prayer, and allow me to lead you in a somewhat flexible manner. Let's sing verses one, two, and five of "Come, Follow Me" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 116).<br><br>Those who immersed themselves completely in that hymn just received a wonderful blessing! Heartfelt singing, whether it is done while you are alone or when surrounded by others, can provide a welcome conduit to peace and true joy.<br><h2><b>Toward Zion</b></h2><br>The Lord revealed a number of things about our day to Nephi. One of them was the following promise: "Blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost" (1 Nephi 13:37). If we were to labor with all our heart, might, mind, and strength to center the arts in Christ, would we help to bring forth Zion? And would we then enjoy the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost more abundantly? I believe we would. But we must be clear in our understanding. "Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom; otherwise [the Lord] cannot receive her unto [Himself]" (D&amp;amp;C 105:5). We must be willing to give up the idols of the world, abide by the principles that characterize celestial life, and follow Christ.<br><br>The Lord has admonished us to "keep [His] commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 6:6; 11:6; 12:6; 14:6). "For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; ... Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments" (D&amp;amp;C 82:14). What a wonderful opportunity we have to place the arts in service to the cause of Zion. Is this not real? Is this not the very purpose of the arts? As we participate together in Christ-centered artistic experiences, we will be increasingly bound together in singleness of purpose and a love for that which is good. We will become "of one heart and one mind" (Moses 7:18). Is this not Zion?<br><br>But there is a price that must be paid. The arts require diligence, sacrifice, and commitment. We have an example in the scriptures of one who imagined a marvelous outcome when he "took no thought save it was to ask" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). He failed. We must do more. According to President Spencer W. Kimball, "We must take thought. We must make effort. We must be patient. We must be professional. We must be spiritual" (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976], 253). And Elder Packer reminds us that our motives must also be considered: "There is a test you might apply if you are among the gifted. Ask yourself this question: When I am free to do what I really want to do, what will it be?" (Packer, "The Arts and the Spirit," 63). Will those who seek to serve the cause of Zion work in accordance with "the Spirit of truth or some other way? ... If it be by some other way," we have been warned, "it is not of God" (D&amp;amp;C 50:17–18).<br><h2><b>Many Ways to Contribute</b></h2><br>There are many kinds of artistic work that can contribute to the building of Zion. We must not constrict or limit our vision in this matter. And there will perhaps always be conflicting issues of personal taste and artistic understanding. Elder Packer offers a point of view that is very insightful and helpful:<br><br><i>I think</i>[Jesus]<i>would rejoice at the playing of militant martial music as men marched to defend a righteous cause. I think that He would think there are times when illustrations should be vigorous, with bold and exciting colors. I think He would chuckle with approval when at times of recreation the music is comical or melodramatic or exciting. Or at times when a carnival air is in order that decorations be bright and flashy, even garish.</i><br><br><i>I think at times of entertainment He would think it quite in order for poetry that would make one laugh or cry--perhaps both at once. I think that He would think it would be in righteous order on many occasions to perform with great dignity symphonies and operas and ballets. I think that He would think that soloists should develop an extensive repertoire, each number to be performed at a time and in a place that is appropriate....</i><br><br><i>But I am sure He would be offended at immodesty and irreverence in music, in art, in poetry, in writing, in sculpture, in dance, or in drama.</i>[Packer, "The Arts and the Spirit," 65]<br><br>What shall we do then? How can we know what is appropriate and useful to the cause of Zion? Nephi gave us an answer that is as precise as it is challenging:<br><br><i>I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after ye have entered in by the way. ...</i><br><br><i>Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak</i>[and, I might appropriately interject, "create" or "perform"]<i>with the tongue of angels? And ... how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?</i><br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, ... feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do. ...</i><br><br><i>... If ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ.</i>[2 Nephi 32:1–6]<br><br>Finally, Elder Packer has extended a challenge that applies to many of us here today:<br><br><i>Go to, then, you who are gifted; cultivate your gift. Develop it in any of the arts and in every worthy example of them. If you have the ability and the desire, seek a career or employ your talent as an avocation or cultivate it as a hobby. But in all ways bless others with it. Set a standard of excellence. Employ it in the secular sense to every worthy advantage, but never use it profanely. Never express your gift unworthily.</i>[Packer, "The Arts and the Spirit," 65]<br><br>I wish to conclude this message with the words of the prophet Moroni. He was a man centered in Christ who understood perfectly the necessity of our conversion and transformation. Join with me in pondering his words and the process they describe:<br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i><br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i>[Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>I pray that we will not deny ourselves access to the power of Christ as we seek learning and edification through the arts. Rather, I hope for the day when all we do will be centered in Christ, that we might then enjoy the spiritual abundance He has promised those who are obedient and faithful.<br><br>I am grateful for the love of our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, and for the peace and creative energy They extend to us through the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. I testify of Their presence and concern for each of us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>K.

<h1>re Am I, Send Me:&quot; Women of God - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
First, may I commend President Bateman, his staff, and the faculty for the truly great things BYU is doing here on the campus and all around the world. You students are attending one of the greatest universities in the world. I hope you understand and know that. Further, I'd like to congratulate our basketball team.<br><br>I have chosen to speak to you today about something that is very close to my heart. I have been married to Sister Ballard, who is with me here on the stand, for 50 years this August. The greatest day in my life was the day I met Barbara Bowen. My greatest accomplishment was convincing her that I was the only true and living returned missionary among all of those that she was dating. It was a most important day when we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. We are the parents of two sons and five daughters. Perhaps being the father of our five daughters and now the grandfather of 22 granddaughters makes me an expert on the subject of women.<br><br>Initially I intended to speak to the women in this audience. But as I have considered the days that lie ahead, I believe this message is vital to both men and women. So I invite you men to pay strict attention. In future days your lives will be increasingly influenced by the women who will become your wives, your daughters, and your associates with whom you will be privileged to work and serve in the Church.<br><br>Let me set the stage by reading from a letter sent recently to Church headquarters. This woman wrote:<br><br><i>I have a wonderful husband and children, whom I love deeply. I love the Lord and His Church more than I can say. I know the Church is true! I realize I shouldn't feel discouraged about who I am. Yet I have been going through an identity crisis most of my life. I have never dared utter these feelings out loud but have hidden them behind the huge, confident smile I wear to Church every week. For years I have doubted if I had any value beyond my roles as a wife and mother. I have feared that men are that they might have joy, but that women are that they might be overlooked. I long to feel that I, as a woman, matter to the Lord.</i><br><br>Today I would like to respond to the issue that underlies the concern of this faithful woman. Does the Lord respect women? Do women matter to the Lord? The answer is yes--a resounding yes!<br><br>Elder James E. Talmage stated that "the world's greatest champion of woman and womanhood is Jesus the Christ" (<i>Jesus the Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956], 475). I believe that. The first time the Lord acknowledged Himself to be the Christ, it was to a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well. He taught her about living water and proclaimed, simply, "I . . . am he" (John 4:26). And it was Martha to whom He proclaimed: "I am the resurrection, and the life. . . . And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die" (John 11:25–26).<br><br>Then, during His greatest agony as He hung on the cross, the Savior reached out to one person--His mother--when in that terrible but glorious moment He asked John the Beloved to care for her as though she were his own (see John 19:26–27).<br><br>Of this you may be certain: The Lord especially loves righteous women--women who are not only faithful but filled with faith, women who are optimistic and cheerful because they know who they are and where they are going, women who are striving to live and serve as women of God.<br><br>There are those who suggest that males are favored of the Lord because they are ordained to hold the priesthood. Anyone who believes this does not understand the great plan of happiness. The premortal and mortal natures of men and women were specified by the Lord Jehovah Himself, and it is simply not within His character to diminish the roles and responsibilities of any of His children.<br><br>As President Joseph Fielding Smith explained, "The Lord offers to his daughters every spiritual gift and blessing that can be obtained by his sons" (in Conference Report, April 1970, 59; or "Magnifying Our Callings in the Priesthood,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>June 1970, 66). All of us, men and women alike, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and are entitled to personal revelation. We may all take upon us the Lord's name, become sons and daughters of Christ, partake of the ordinances of the temple from which we emerge endowed with power, receive the fulness of the gospel, and achieve exaltation in the celestial kingdom. These spiritual blessings are available to men and women alike, according to their faithfulness and their effort to receive them.<br><br>The basic doctrinal purpose for the creation of the earth is to provide for God's spirit children the continuation of the process of exaltation and eternal life. God said to Moses:<br><br><i>And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them.</i><br><br><i>And I, God, blessed them, and said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</i>[Moses 2:27–28]<br><br>The Church's proclamation on the family confirms that God has not revoked or changed this commandment. The First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles "solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102).<br><br>This doctrine sometimes causes women to ask: "Is a woman's value dependent exclusively upon her role as a wife and mother?" The answer is simple and obvious: No. Although there is nothing a woman can do that has more far-reaching, eternal impact than to rear her children to walk in righteousness, motherhood and marital status are not the only measures of a woman's worth. Some women do not have the privilege of marrying or rearing children in this life. To the worthy, these blessings will come later. Men and women who do have the privilege of rearing children will of course be held accountable for that priceless, eternal stewardship. Although there is simply not a more significant contribution you can make to society, to the Church, or to the eternal destiny of our Father's children than what you will do as a mother or father, motherhood and fatherhood are not the only measures of goodness or of one's acceptance before the Lord. Every righteous man and woman has a significant role to play in the onward march of the kingdom of God.<br><br>I have a deep and abiding feeling about women and about the crucial difference they make in every important setting--particularly in the family and in the Church. I have spoken boldly about the role women must play in the council system of the Church. We cannot fulfill our mission as a Church without the inspired insight and support of women.<br><br>For that reason I am concerned about what I see happening with some of our young women. Satan would have you dress, talk, and behave in unnatural and destructive ways in your relationships with young men. The adversary is having a heyday distorting attitudes about gender and roles and about families and individual worth. He is the author of mass confusion about the value, the role, the contribution, and the unique nature of women. Today's popular culture, which is preached by every form of media from the silver screen to the Internet, celebrates the sexy, saucy, socially aggressive woman. These distortions are seeping into the thinking of some of our own women.<br><br>My deep desire is to clarify how we in the presiding councils of the Church feel about the sisters of this Church, how our Heavenly Father feels about His daughters, and what He expects of them. My dear sisters, we believe in you. We believe in and are counting on your goodness and your strength, your propensity for virtue and valor, your kindness and courage, your strength and resilience. We believe in your mission as women of God. We realize that you are the emotional (and sometimes spiritual) glue that holds families and often ward families together. We believe that the Church simply will not accomplish what it must without your faith and faithfulness, your innate tendency to put the well-being of others ahead of your own, and your spiritual strength and tenacity. And we believe that God's plan is for you to become queens and to receive the highest blessings any woman can receive in time or eternity. On the other hand, Satan's plan is to get you so preoccupied with the world's glitzy lie about women that you completely miss what you have come here to do and to become. Remember, he wants us to "be miserable like unto himself" (2 Nephi 2:27). Never lose your precious identity by doing anything that would jeopardize the promised eternal future your Heavenly Father has provided for you.<br><br>Young men, lest you get too comfortable while I focus on the women, you have a significant role in all of this. You are sometimes the reason our young women get distracted from their eternal mission here. Let the women in your life know that you want them to be women of God and not women of the world. Of you the Lord expects protection and safety for His daughters. Great will be your remorse if you should steal from anyone her virtue and purity.<br><br>My earnest plea and prayer is that young men and women will understand that our sisters have always been vital and integral to the work of the Lord. Faithful women have labored valiantly in the cause of truth and righteousness from before the foundations of this world. In President Joseph F. Smith's vision of the redemption of the dead, he saw not only Father Adam and other prophets but "our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had lived through the ages and worshiped the true and living God" (D&amp;amp;C 138:39).<br><br>Think about the incomparable role of Eve, whose actions set in motion the great plan of our Father. And what about Mary, the "precious and chosen vessel" (Alma 7:10) who bore the Christ child? Surely no one would question the contribution made by these majestic women.<br><br>Our dispensation is not without its heroines. Countless women from every continent and walk of life have made dramatic contributions to the cause of Christ. Consider Lucy Mack Smith, the mother of the martyred prophets Joseph and Hyrum and the grandmother of President Joseph F. Smith. Her resilience and righteousness under the most emotionally and spiritually taxing conditions surely influenced her prophet sons and set them firmly on the path toward fulfilling their foreordained destiny.<br><br>At this point you may be thinking, "But what about me and my contribution? I'm not Eve or Mary or even Lucy Mack Smith. I'm just regular, plain old me. Is there something about my contribution that is significant to the Lord? Does He really need me?" Remember, the righteous who are not highly visible are valued too, and in the words of a Book of Mormon prophet are "no less serviceable unto the people" (Alma 48:19).<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball responded to that question this way:<br><br><i>Both a righteous man and a righteous woman are a blessing to all those whom their lives touch.</i><br><br>[In]<i>the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignments while faithful men were foreordained to certain priesthood tasks. While we do not now remember the particulars, . . . we are accountable for those things which long ago were expected of us.</i>[<i>My Beloved Sisters</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979), 37]<br><br>Every sister in this Church who has made covenants with the Lord has a divine mandate to help save souls, to lead the women of the world, to strengthen the homes of Zion, and to build the kingdom of God. Sister Eliza R. Snow, the second general president of the Relief Society, said that "every sister in this church should be a preacher of righteousness . . . because we have greater and higher privileges than any other females upon the face of the earth" ("Great Indignation Meeting [Continued],"<i>Deseret Evening News,</i>15 January 1870, 2).<br><br>Every sister who stands for truth and righteousness diminishes the influence of evil. Every sister who strengthens and protects her family is doing the work of God. Every sister who lives as a woman of God becomes a beacon for others to follow and plants seeds of righteous influence that will be harvested for decades to come. Every sister who makes and keeps sacred covenants becomes an instrument in the hands of God.<br><br>I have been drawn to an interchange between God the Father and His eldest and Only Begotten Son, who is the ultimate example of living up to one's premortal promises. When God asked who would come to earth to prepare a way for all mankind to be saved and strengthened and blessed, it was Jesus Christ who said, simply, "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27).<br><br>Just as the Savior stepped forward to fulfill His divine responsibilities, we have the challenge and responsibility to do likewise. If you are wondering if you make a difference to the Lord, imagine the impact when you make commitments such as the following:<br><br>"Father, if you need a woman to rear children in righteousness, here am I, send me."<br><br>"If you need a woman who will shun vulgarity and dress modestly and speak with dignity and show the world how joyous it is to keep the commandments, here am I, send me."<br><br>"If you need a woman who can resist the alluring temptations of the world by keeping her eyes fixed on eternity, here am I, send me."<br><br>"If you need a woman of faithful steadiness, here am I, send me."<br><br>Between now and the day the Lord comes again, He needs women in every family, in every ward, in every community, in every nation who will step forward in righteousness and say by their words and their actions, "Here am I, send me."<br><br>My question today is, Will you be one of those women? And will you men who hold the priesthood answer the same call?<br><br>Now I know most of you want to. But how will you do it? How, in a world filled with deceptive messages about women and the family--and the significance of both to the Lord--will you perpetually respond to the Lord, "Here am I, send me"?<br><br>For those who really want to live up to who you are, for those who at all costs want to repent if necessary and who want to see through Satan's deceptions, I have two suggestions: First, listen to and follow those whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. Second, learn to hear the voice of the Spirit, or the voice of the Lord as communicated by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I cannot stress enough the importance of listening to and following the prophet and the apostles. In today's world, where 24 hours a day the media's talking heads spew forth conflicting opinions, where men and women jockey for everything from your money to your vote, there is one clear, unpolluted, unbiased voice that you can always count on. And that is the voice of the living prophet and the apostles. Their only motive is "the everlasting welfare of your souls" (2 Nephi 2:30).<br><br>Think of it! Think about the value of having a source of information that you can always count on, that will always have your eternal interests at heart, and that will always provide inspired truth. That is a phenomenal gift and guide.<br><br>Just four months ago President Hinckley spoke to you in a Churchwide fireside. Have you studied his message and identified things you need to avoid or do differently? I know a 17-year-old who just prior to the prophet's talk had pierced her ears a second time. She came home from the fireside, took off the second set of earrings, and said to her parents, "If President Hinckley says we should only wear one set of earrings, that's good enough for me."<br><br>Wearing two pairs of earrings may or may not have eternal consequences for this young woman, but her willingness to obey the prophet will. And if she will obey him now, on something relatively simple, how much easier it will be to follow him when greater issues are at stake.<br><br>Today I make you a promise. It is a simple one, but it is true. If you will listen to the living prophet and the apostles and heed our counsel, you will not go astray.<br><br>If you want to avoid the snares of Satan, if you need direction when the choices in front of you are puzzling and perplexing, learn to hear the voice of the Lord as communicated through the Holy Ghost. And then, of course, do what it tells you to do.<br><br>Nephi taught clearly that the Holy Ghost "is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him" and that "he that diligently seeketh shall find" (1 Nephi 10:17, 19). The stunning reality, my dear young brothers and sisters, is that you control how close you are to the Lord. You determine just how clear and readily available promptings from the Holy Ghost will be. You determine this by your actions, by your attitude, by the choices you make, by the things you watch and wear and listen to and read, and by how consistently and sincerely you invite the Spirit into your life.<br><br>Contemplate for a moment the extent and the impact of this blessing! You have been given a gift that when exercised and respected will give you the answers to all of the confusing, thorny questions and problems you will face in your lives.<br><br>I can only imagine some of the questions you are facing right now. Should you marry the young man you are now dating, or not? Should you finish your degree, or not? Should you serve a mission, or not? What career should you pursue? Why pursue a career with vigor when all you've ever really wanted is to be a mother?<br><br>As life progresses, how will you respond to challenges that will inevitably come? Will you know where to turn for peace and consolation if you are called upon to bury a child--as two of our own children have done--or if a child threatens to stray from the gospel path? How will you know what to do when you face financial reverses? Where will you turn for insight and inspiration when you are called upon to lead in your ward or stake? You young men are facing similar kinds of questions.<br><br>To all of you there is only one way to safely and confidently meet the obstacles and opportunities that are part of life's path. First, listen to the prophet and the apostles. Study the principles we teach. Then take those principles to the Lord and ask Him how you should apply them in your life. Ask Him to influence your thoughts, temper your actions, and guide your steps. "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good" (Alma 37:37). He will communicate with you through the power and presence of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>There are several things that greatly enhance our ability to understand the promptings of the Holy Ghost and thereby hear the voice of God.<br><br><b>First is fasting and prayer.</b>When the sons of Mosiah were united with Alma the Younger, they rejoiced in their reunion and acknowledged that because "they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting," they had been gifted with the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and "when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God" (Alma 17:3).<br><br><b>Second is immersing yourself in the scriptures.</b>The word of God "will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3). The scriptures are a conduit for personal revelation. Your generation is much more versed in holy writ than was mine at your age. You have been taught to read and study the scriptures. I urge you to intensify your study of them. I promise that your ability to hear the voice of the Lord as communicated through the Holy Ghost will increase and improve.<br><br><b>Third is preparing to spend time in the house of the Lord.</b>When the time appropriately comes for you to go to the temple, you will leave the temple "armed with . . . power" (D&amp;amp;C 109:22) and with the promise that as we "grow up" in our knowledge of the Lord, we will "receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C 109:15). The temple is a place of personal revelation. If you are endowed, visit the temple regularly. If you are not, prepare yourself to enter, for inside the doors of the temple rests the power that will fortify you against the vicissitudes of life.<br><br><b>Fourth is listening to the counsel of your father and mother.</b>They are wise and experienced. Share with them, as my children have shared with me, your fears and concerns. Seek blessings from your father. If for some reason he is not worthy or able, go to your bishop or your stake president. They love you and will count it a privilege to bless your life. You should also receive your patriarchal blessing.<br><br><b>Fifth is obedience and repentance.</b>There are certain things you simply cannot do if you want to have the Holy Ghost with you. It is not possible to listen to vulgar lyrics, watch movies filled with sexual innuendo, tamper with pornography on the Internet (or anywhere else for that matter), take the name of the Lord in vain, wear revealing clothing, compromise in any way the law of chastity, or disregard the values of true manhood and womanhood and expect the Holy Ghost to remain with you. Whenever anyone participates in those kinds of activities, it should not be a surprise if feelings of loneliness, discouragement, and unworthiness follow. Do not make the choice to go it alone rather than have the Spirit of the Lord to guide, to protect, to prompt, to warn, and to fill you with peace. Repent if you need to so you can enjoy the companionship of the Spirit.<br><br>Women and men who can hear the voice of the Lord, and who respond to those promptings, become invaluable instruments in His hands. I will never forget an experience I had following a stake conference. I was asked to participate in a blessing for a young woman your age who was suffering with cancer. The family were converts, and they had found peace through the promptings of the Spirit. Prior to our giving the blessing, this dear sister said to me: "Elder Ballard, I am not afraid to die, but I would like to live here with my family. I am prepared to accept the will of my Father in Heaven. Please bless me to find peace and to know that He will be with me." What faith, insight, and courage the Spirit had blessed her with! A few months later the family advised me that Heavenly Father had called her home. She died in peace, and the family lived in peace because they were familiar with the Spirit. One of the sweetest messages the Spirit will relay is how the Lord feels about you. And that reassurance will strengthen you in a way that almost nothing else can.<br><br>Now, finally, I turn again to you dear sisters, you who have such a profound, innate spiritual ability to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd. You need never wonder again if you have worth in the sight of the Lord and to the Brethren in the presiding councils of the Church. We love you. We cherish you. We respect you. Never doubt that your influence is absolutely vital to preserving the family and to assisting with the growth and spiritual vitality of the Church. This Church will not reach its foreordained destiny without you. We men simply cannot nurture like you nurture. Most of us don't have the sensitivity--spiritual and otherwise--that by your eternal nature you inherently have. Your influence on families and with children, with youth, and with men is singular. You are natural-born nurturers. Because of these unusual gifts and talents, you are vital to taking the gospel to all the world, to demonstrating that there is joy in living the way the prophets have counseled us to live.<br><br>More than ever before we need women of faith, virtue, vision, and charity, as the Relief Society declaration proclaims. We need women who can hear and who will respond to the voice of the Lord, women who at all costs will defend and protect the family. We don't need women who want to be like men, sound like men, dress like men, drive like some men drive, or act like men. We do need women who rejoice in their womanhood and have a spiritual confirmation of their identity, their value, and their eternal destiny. Above all, we need women who will stand up for truth and righteousness and decry evil at every turn and simply say, "Lord, here am I, send me."<br><br>I bear my witness and testimony to you this morning, my beloved young members of this church, that you are precious, that this is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The kingdom of God will roll forward until it fills the entire earth. It is for you to be beacons and banners to the entire world, to show the women and the men of the world there is such a natural disposition in women to do good, and to seek after things of the Spirit, what is right and what is true.<br><br>I simply say to you this morning, God bless the women of the Church, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>ral Law of Blessings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Looking out over this group, I am reminded of a BYU devotional that I attended back when I was a freshman. President Ernest L. Wilkinson was conducting. Just like today, we were on the verge of spring. "Ah, spring!" President Wilkinson said. "What a wonderful season! Spring is that time when a young man's thoughts turn to that which a young woman has been thinking about all winter long."<br><br>As you learned from my introduction, I am an agronomist. A considerable part of my career has been devoted to improving the production of corn. I begin my remarks with an insight that I have gained from my corn research, an insight that helps me to understand the key to obtaining blessings from heaven.<br><br>Let me show you a simple bar graph that shows corn yield as influenced by the previous crop. The best yield was obtained from corn that was grown on a field that had not been planted to corn for five years. The next best yield was from a field on which corn was grown alternately with soybeans. The most depressed yields were all from fields that had been planted to corn following a previous planting of corn for two, three, four, five, or ten years in a row.<br><br>The graph illustrates what is referred to among crop scientists as the rotation effect. Those of you who grow tomatoes have learned that they will not yield their best if you repeatedly grow them in the same spot in your garden year after year. A veteran Idaho potato farmer once said that the best rotation for potatoes was a thousand years of sagebrush and one year of potatoes.<br><br>There are two significant conclusions that my students and I gathered from our 20 years of research with corn. The first was that the rotation effect was unfailingly reliable. Rotated corn<i>always,</i>not just sometimes, but<i>always</i>gave the best yields. No matter the weather, no matter how we modified our management or inputs of fertilizers or pesticides, we could not lift the yield of continuous corn to the level of a first-year crop. Second, although we did gain some insights, we were never able to determine why that first-year yield boost occurred. We evaluated every physical and biological factor we could think of. We finally accepted that we were working with a law of nature and that we could not divert Mother Nature from her decreed course.<br><br>It is about the laws of Mother Nature--or rather about the laws of Mother Nature's father--that I will speak today. We might refer to Mother Nature's father as Grandfather Nature--or we might call him God.<br><br>I now switch from corn to my family. The youngest of our seven children is a nine-year-old girl named Sadie. Sadie's favorite home-evening game is what we call "the blessing game." To play the blessing game we need only our hands and a small treat. M&amp;amp;M's are good, or raisins. When Sadie starts the game, the rest of us place our hands on our laps, cupped open, and we shut our eyes. Sadie then goes around to each of us, one by one, and either places a treat in our hands or passes us by, leaving our hands empty. When she has finished her round, she calls for us to open our eyes and declare whether we were "blessed" with the small treat or not.<br><br>Once we discover who was blessed and who was passed by, we try and ascertain the "law" or condition of the blessing. Did Sadie give a raisin to only those in the circle who had shoes on, or maybe to those who had slept in the tent the night before? You see, some of the qualifications are elusive, and we have to ask for clues. When someone finally guesses the common qualifying prerequisite of the blessed ones, it is that person's turn, and we all close our eyes and cup our hands again.<br><br>One condition of the game, upon which Sadie's father insists, is that each time we play it, we read three scriptures.<br><br>The first is from D&amp;amp;C 78:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17]<br><br>The second is from D&amp;amp;C 130:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>The third is from D&amp;amp;C 132:<br><br><i>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:5]<br><br>As we read these scriptures in our family home evening, we like to consider the blessings that Heavenly Father has in His hands and how they must differ from Sadie's M&amp;amp;M's.<br><br>I'm going to quickly review a couple of Heavenly Father's irrevocably decreed blessings. The first is from section 62 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for the testimony which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you, and your sins are forgiven you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 62:3]<br><br>It is interesting that the angels in heaven record our testimonies and look upon them and rejoice over us for having borne them. It is remarkable that our sins are forgiven by the bearing of testimony. Just like the corn rotation effect, I have not figured out how this works, but I believe it does, for just three verses later in section 62, we find: "I, the Lord, promise the faithful and cannot lie" (D&amp;amp;C 62:6).<br><br>Section 78 of the Doctrine and Covenants describes an exceptional blessing for the simple act of maintaining a thankful heart:<br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:19]<br><br>The scriptures are well sprinkled with examples of blessings that seem extravagant in proportion to their qualifications. We have the windows of heaven opening with more blessings than we can accommodate just for paying our tithing.<br><br>I am going to focus the rest of my talk on one incredible conditional blessing laid forth by the Lord in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants known as the oath and covenant of the priesthood. This is the key to my message. I invite you to invest your attention.<br><br><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i><br><br><i>And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:35–40]<br><br>Did you notice it? Did you catch the simple qualification that we need to meet in order to receive the blessing of the Father's kingdom and all that the Father has? It's in there, and it is powerful in its simplicity. Sisters, I am completely confident that it is there for you to observe and fully receive as well as the brethren.<br><br>Let's go over it again: "And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord."<br><br>And how do we "receive" the Lord? He tells us in the next phrase: "For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me."<br><br>There it is. That is the qualification. Receive the Lord's servants. If we receive the Lord's servants, we receive the Lord. And if we receive the Lord, we receive the Father. And when we receive the Father, we receive the Father's kingdom and all that the Father has.<br><br>Bear with me now while I explore with you the implication of the oath and covenant that the Father makes with those who receive the servants of His Son. And let's not overlook the fact that this is an oath and covenant that the Father "cannot break, neither can it be moved."<br><br>I'm going to tell five stories. All of them are true.<br><br>The first story took place 3,000 years ago. It started with a lad who was of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look upon and of whom the Lord said to the prophet Samuel, "Arise, anoint him: for this is he" (1 Samuel 16:12). He was the lad who "put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead ... ; and he fell upon his face to the earth" (1 Samuel 17:49). Yes, this was David, who returned from the slaughter of the Philistine to encounter the women coming<br><br><i>out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing ... with instruments of musick.</i><br><br><i>And the women ... said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</i><br><br><i>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? ...</i><br><br><i>And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul.</i>[1 Samuel 18:6–12]<br><br>And then we have Saul casting his javelin at the young hero in jealousy, saying, "I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of [Saul's] presence" (1 Samuel 18:11).<br><br>The part of the story I want to focus on is the part where Saul, hearing that David was in the wilderness, "took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats" (1 Samuel 24:1–2). This is the part where David and his men were hidden in the very cave into which Saul entered to take a nap. And the men of David said unto him, "Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee" (1 Samuel 24:4)<br><br>Now, under these circumstances, what thoughts might have passed through David's head? It was obvious to him that Samuel, and the Lord, had rejected Saul, that Saul was a belligerent and mean-spirited man whose principal activity was to hunt David for his life, that the people of Israel loved David, that David was their hero, and, most of all, that he, David, had been selected by God and anointed by the prophet to replace Saul as king.<br><br>So what did David do? The record tells us that he crept quietly forth and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe. And when Saul rose up out of the cave and departed, David let him go a safe distance and then called after him, holding up the skirt of the robe, saying, "My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself" (1 Samuel 24:8).<br><br>Then, realizing what had happened, how his life had been in the hands of David and that David had spared him and was at that moment kneeling before him, "Saul lifted up his voice, and wept" (1 Samuel 24:16).<br><br>Now, are we not impressed with the conduct of David? Under the circumstances, has he not acted admirably? But wait. There are two more verses that we must read.<br><br><i>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.</i>[1 Samuel 24:5–6]<br><br>When I consider this story and the admirable perspective and actions of David, I am awed. I cannot think of another account that compares to this one as an example of honoring an anointed servant of the Lord, even when that servant, by any accounting, did not appear worthy of it.<br><br>My second story takes place in New Zealand, where my missionary companion and I were laboring in a suburb of the capital city of Wellington. I have changed people's names. We arrived at sacrament meeting one evening to discover the chapel completely filled. The branch president was being released. There were no seats left, so we stood in the back. I noticed, sitting on the last bench, a member of the branch who was inactive. His name was Jimmy Solomon. Jimmy drove a taxi, and I had seen him on the streets several times, usually with a cigar in his mouth.<br><br>"Everyone's here to see the change of guard," I thought, "even Jimmy Solomon."<br><br>After the retiring branch president had been given a vote of thanks, the mission president told the congregation that the Lord had called Brother Jimmy Solomon to be the next branch president. A gasp arose from the congregation. It seemed that everyone turned and looked at Jimmy. His head was down, and he was twisting a small cap in his hands.<br><br>"All who feel they can support Brother Solomon in this calling, please indicate with a show of hands." A few hands went up. "Are there any opposed?" The room was filled with hands.<br><br>I had never witnessed such a thing. "What do they do now?" I wondered.<br><br>The meeting was adjourned. All who were opposed were invited into the cultural hall to share their concerns. My companion and I did not join the group. The next morning we learned that, after much discussion, Jimmy Solomon had been sustained and ordained as the new president of the branch.<br><br>About a week later my companion and I were standing on the corner of a busy street in Wellington. We noticed a familiar figure driving a taxi toward us. As he passed by, we saw, to our disappointment, that there was a cigar in President Solomon's mouth.<br><br>That was the last I saw of Jimmy Solomon before I was transferred. A year later I returned to the branch to perform a baptism. Following the service we were invited to the house of the good brother who had been the branch president just prior to Jimmy Solomon. When we had finished our meal, he stood and said, "Come, there's something I want you to see." We went with him down the street to the house of Jimmy Solomon. The room we entered was brightly lighted and warm and full of the feeling of friendship. As I took hold of Jimmy Solomon's large hand, I noticed his face. It radiated. He was enthusiastic about our missionary work, and he talked about his love of the temple.<br><br>"What happened?" I asked the good brother as we left Jimmy's house a while later.<br><br>"Well," he answered, "as you remember, it was a challenging time for all of us when Jimmy was selected to lead the branch. The high priests group got together. We all agreed that the Lord must have called Jimmy, because none of us would have ever thought of it. And we reckoned that if the Lord had called him, it was our duty to sustain him. Together we went to him and assured him of our love and support. We volunteered to accept callings.<br><br>"Jimmy threw away his cigar. He started acting like the leader the Lord knew he was. And you know what? He went around to all of his beer-drinking buddies and got them started back to church, too. He has taken several of them to the temple. It's been wonderful. I couldn't have reached those men. And, as you saw today, we're building a new chapel. The old one can't hold all of us anymore."<br><br>The third story took place when I was a graduate student. I was standing before a chalkboard about halfway through my preliminary oral exam for my PhD. One of the professors had discovered an aspect of my knowledge and training in which I was weak, and he was proceeding to expose my ignorance. I recall very clearly how my thoughts floated above me, as it were, out of reach. And when the professor asked me a question, my thoughts began to drift slowly down toward me. But before they could reach me, I was hit with another question, and my thoughts quickly retreated back up again, out of my reach. I lost all hope, and instead of concentrating on the answers to the questions, I began to consider how I was going to deal with failing the exam.<br><br>Suddenly a different member of the examining committee broke in. "Stop. That's enough," he said. "Crookston, come and sit down. It's my turn to ask questions." I returned to my chair, feeling that I had been plucked from the roasting pan only to be tossed into the fire. He who had ordered me to sit down was a biochemist, and biochemistry was a subject in which I was less fluent than the one in which I had just been floundering.<br><br>But, instead of asking about biochemistry, the professor proceeded to ask me about my family and about my father's occupation. Once he could see that I was clearheaded again, he nurtured me through a discussion that led us into an area of my research where I was able to serve as teacher to him. Soon another examiner took up where the biochemist had left off, and I blossomed with answers that came to me quickly. I passed the exam.<br><br>I have looked back on that experience a hundred times. And every time I have, I have wondered what might have become of me if that professor had not received me, had not calmed me, had not allowed me to demonstrate one of my strengths rather than leave me to wallow in my weakness. He will forever remain one of my saviors.<br><br>The fourth story is short. We were living in the city of Saint Paul, which is home to one of America's great Catholic cathedrals. One of the archbishops of the Catholic Church presides there. One morning in the newspaper I read that the archbishop had been arrested for driving while intoxicated. I was startled. Later that same day one of my graduate students came to my office. She was a Catholic nun. Meaning to express concern and empathy, I asked her about the news of the archbishop.<br><br>"Oh, the dear, dear man," she replied quickly. "I have been praying for him ever since we received the news. He is my archbishop. He needs my support."<br><br>No sooner had I registered her sweet supportive nature than a disturbing question darted into my mind. How would I have responded had the same news been printed about our stake president and it was the Catholic sister asking the question of me?<br><br>Perhaps this story has made you uncomfortable. Let me be so bold as to move from the archbishop and the stake president to the Prophet Joseph Smith. This will be the fifth story.<br><br>It was late at night. I was alone on an assignment in Africa, and I was reading a book entitled<i>Joseph Smith: The First Mormon,</i>written by Donna Hill. It was a book that bore the mark of scholarship, with hundreds of notes and references. In one of the later chapters, which was entitled "Dissent in Nauvoo," the author had documented what appeared to be unlawful actions and an associated cover-up on the part of the Prophet in ordering the destruction of the<i>Nauvoo Expositor.</i>I checked the references; they appeared solid. I grew uneasy. A disturbing spirit entered the room. I shut the book. I turned out the light. I was troubled by what I was feeling. I wished I had never been given the book.<br><br>And then, suddenly, all the noises of my mind fell still. It was like a late winter afternoon, when all the sparrows of the neighborhood seem to have gathered to one single tree, and they go about hopping and chirping among the branches, like it was a little sparrow conference. Have you ever heard that? If you're like me, you don't notice it until something causes all the little birds to fall silent. They do that. Suddenly they all stop, exactly at once. And then the silence is so conspicuous that you take notice. Well, my mind went silent like that.<br><br>And into the silence there came what I could best describe as a scolding. "So," the words said. "You feel to reprove the actions of the Prophet, do you? You are upset, here in the darkness, because someone wrote something in their journal suggesting that Joseph Smith was not perfect. Not perfect. Imperfection disappoints you. And just who do you think you are? What do you suppose you would have done, had you been in charge in Nauvoo during those grim days? How would you have dealt with the apostasy, with the enmity, with the slander, with unending threats on your life? You expected perfection. You know better than that. Only Jesus was perfect. What imperfection would you have chosen for Joseph? Go ahead. You choose. What imperfection would you accept? He did have failings, you know. Some of them are documented right in the Doctrine and Covenants. And you! You get up on your high horse and condemn him for being a mortal. Shame on you!"<br><br>The chastisement continued. "Your problem, young man, your biggest challenge in your Church life, will be to accept those turkeys they call to preside over you at the local level in the Church. Turkeys is what you will be inclined to call them, because they will make mistakes--some disturbing ones. Your test will be to overlook imperfections, especially in those who appear to you to be less qualified for office than you think you are. Now get down off your high horse and start being thankful for the life of an imperfect man who, as a prophet of God, has brought into your life treasures immeasurable. Be thankful for President Kimball, who has struggled mightily with imperfections and gone on to earn and deserve the office of prophet and to serve as an inspiration to millions, including you."<br><br>And then the words stopped. And I slipped out from under my covers and my knees found the floor and I apologized. And I began pouring out a prayer of thankfulness for the Prophet Joseph Smith and for all that he had done for me. And I thanked the Lord for my bishop and for the time and effort that he spent in behalf of my family. And I expressed appreciation for teachers on low wages who taught my children in school and for politicians and judges struggling through the defects of imperfect systems on my behalf. And then I joyfully expressed thanks for the feelings of acceptance and appreciation that had moved into my heart, replacing criticism and censure.<br><br>Well, I trust that these few stories have helped you understand my feelings and perspectives related to the business of "receiving" the Lord'servants. You can see that I believe that the servants of the Lord are all around us and that we have the opportunity to receive them every day. Actually, I have studied the qualifier and the promise within the oath and covenant of the priesthood for almost as long as I have studied corn. And, as with the corn rotation effect, I do not fully understand this promise--how such a modest qualifier can result in such an awesome blessing--but I do believe I have achieved some insight into how it works. Bear with me while we role-play for a moment.<br><br>It is a hot day. You are in traffic that is at a virtual standstill. You are late for your appointment--exasperated. On your right a vehicle approaches. You stay close to the car in front of you. The car behind you stays close to you. Notice how you feel. Now, see it differently. See yourself letting a space open up in front of you and you motioning to the approaching vehicle to move in. Did you see a wave and a smile?<br><br>Also notice this: The very instant we made the decision to open up and let the other driver in, something happened within us. I'm sure you felt it. As soon as we decided to let the other car in, our "way of being" was altered. Would I be correct in suggesting that when we opened up a space in the traffic, our "way of being" became Christlike? "For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me."<br><br>The scriptures are full of this principle. From Matthew we read:<br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:34–40]<br><br>Is it not clear that everyone with whom we associate--everyone, from beginners on the job to seasoned veterans who preside over us--all are benefited when we receive them and support them, even when we disagree with them? I am sure of it.<br><br>I testify that whenever I have been able to humbly approach with the resolve to be a comforter and a peacemaker another person with whom I disagree, the Holy Ghost has accompanied me, and both the other person and I have been able to "receive" and support one another, even though we have different perspectives. There is a two-way blessing involved in this. Both the one who does the receiving and the one who is received are blessed. Shakespeare put it well when he spoke through Portia to Shylock in<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>(act 4, scene 1, lines 179–82):<br><br><i>The quality of mercy is not strain'd;</i><br><i>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</i><br><i>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:</i><br><i>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</i><br><br>It is time to close. Let me summarize my message.<br><br>The first concept I have hoped to develop is that the Father's hands are filled with blessings for us and there are immovable laws that govern the delivery of those blessings. Whenever we are obedient to the law upon which a blessing is based, it will be delivered.<br><br>The second concept is that all that the Father has will be ours if we meet one simple qualifier. The simple qualifier is that we receive the servants of the Father's Son. The scriptures make it clear that those servants include not only the prophets and apostles but also all of our brothers and sisters who stand in need of our encouragement and support.<br><br>I am convinced that what we find written in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants is an irrevocable promise that Grandfather Nature "cannot break, neither can it be moved." That we may become skilled, especially at this university, in receiving the servants of the Savior, including one another, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>R.

<h1>rine of Religious Freedom - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would be remiss on this occasion if I did not express gratitude for the opportunities I have had during one of the great transformative epochs in human history--the decade after the collapse of communism--to visit almost every post-communist country and to work with leaders in their homelands on implementing the ideals of religious freedom. I am grateful beyond measure for blessings that have been given and keys that have been exercised to allow me to participate in the high adventure of opening the doors of nations.<br><br>Several years ago a close friend and Church leader gave me a blessing promising that I would be able to invoke the witness of the Holy Ghost when I spoke with others about religious freedom. In fulfillment of that blessing, I have seen the influence of the Spirit change the hearts and minds and, indeed, the entire outlook of many of the governmental leaders with whom I have met, the "gatekeepers" who stand at the doors of nations. I pray that the Spirit will be with me again today as I have the chance to bear witness of this great principle among my own people.<br><h2><b>The Doctrine of Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>The title of my address--"The Doctrine of Religious Freedom"--is intended to remind us that religious freedom is not merely an important constitutional and human right.<sup>1</sup>There can be no doubt that it is a "first" freedom.<sup>2</sup>But for us it is even more: it is a matter of doctrine. Our 11th article of faith reads:<br><br><i>We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.</i><br><br>Moreover, this is not merely doctrinal for us--it is a core doctrine. Yet, as I will explain, it is a paradoxical doctrine. And it is a doctrine of prophecy.<br><h2><b>Religious Freedom Is a Core Doctrine</b></h2><br>That religious freedom is a core doctrine has been reemphasized to my mind by the following remarkable statement from Elder Bruce R. McConkie:<br><br><i>Freedom of worship is one of the basic doctrines of the gospel. Indeed, in one manner of speaking</i>it is the most basic of all doctrines,<i>even taking precedence over the nature and kind of being that God is, or the atoning sacrifice of the Son of God, or the vesting of priesthood and keys and saving power in the one true church. By this we mean that if there were no freedom of worship, there would be no God, no redemption, and no salvation in the kingdom of God.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Note two things about this statement. First, Elder McConkie does not say this is the most<i>important</i>doctrine. He said that "it is the most basic of all doctrines." It is the most basic because none of the other doctrines could become operative or have any meaning or authenticity if we did not have the option to choose them freely. The exercise of this right is in fact an attribute of divinity.<sup>4</sup>The atoning sacrifice of Christ would be meaningless if we could not avail ourselves of its power to save and exalt through freely chosen acts of faith, repentance, and covenanting. Part of the reason the Messiah is "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"<sup>5</sup>is that at the key moment in the premortal existence, He recommended the Father's plan of freedom, knowing its cost. He knew the price that He personally would pay to atone for all our abuses of freedom. He also knew that despite His payment of that price, countless numbers of His beloved brothers and sisters--individuals He loves with a depth and intensity that passes our understanding--would be lost forever because of their own decision "to choose captivity and death."<sup>6</sup><br><br>This brings me to the second point about Elder McConkie's statement. Note that he did not say that it made no difference<i>how</i>we exercise this freedom; to the contrary, everything depends on learning to follow the divine pattern set by the Master of worship in every thought and deed and with all our "heart, ... might, mind, and strength."<sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>The Paradox of Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>Paradoxically, following the pattern set by the Master includes learning to respect the beliefs and choices made by others, even while standing firm in witnessing and teaching doctrinal truths. Indeed, following the pattern means standing for the rights and freedoms of others, even at the cost of our own lives--and surely also even at the lesser cost of inconvenience or discomfort.<br><br>This paradoxical nature of the doctrine of religious freedom needs to be emphasized and understood more deeply. Most of our doctrines are teachings that we affirm and agree to follow. In contrast, although religious freedom is basic and foundational for the system of gospel truth, it demands that we respect the views of those who adhere to other systems of belief. What is paradoxical is that our belief in religious freedom obligates us to tolerate and respect beliefs with which we disagree--though it does not require us to accept, endorse, or support them.<br><br>Part of the paradox is explained by the fact, attested by all the modern prophets, that the gospel embraces all truth.<sup>8</sup>But more is involved in the doctrine of religious freedom than an admonition to accept truth wherever we find it.<sup>9</sup>It is a recognition of the realities of human dignity and conscience and of the obligation to respect agency at the precious core of the human spirit. This doctrine has had great practical meaning for our leaders.<sup>10</sup>Just a year before his martyrdom, Joseph Smith declared:<br><br><i>The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a "Mormon." I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of the Roman Catholics, or of any other denomination who may be unpopular and too weak to defend themselves.</i><br><br><i>It is a love of liberty which inspires my soul--civil and religious liberty to the whole of the human race.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Forgetting the paradox of religious freedom has been a cause of incalculable suffering during human history. Too often, groups who have pleaded for tolerance while they were a persecuted minority have turned into persecutors as soon as they acquired political power. Joseph Smith was very conscious of this tragic tendency toward unrighteous dominion and repudiated it.<sup>12</sup>We as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should not be guilty of insensitivity in this area. Having so often suffered from religious intolerance in the past, we should go the extra mile in assuring that others are not exposed to similar pain.<sup>13</sup>What those who forget this paradox do not understand is that the mere possession of truth does not carry with it a right to impose that truth on others. God possesses all truth, yet He has left us our freedom.<br><br>In the end, the paradox of religious freedom is linked to many of the deepest truths of the gospel, which share a similar paradoxical structure. "Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."<sup>14</sup>"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men."<sup>15</sup>What ultimately lies behind this paradox is the second great commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."<sup>16</sup>Love lies at the heart of the paradox and at the core of religious freedom.<br><br><i>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</i><br><br><i>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Stated differently, what makes the doctrine of religious freedom paradoxical is that the right to enjoy religious freedom for ourselves carries with it a reciprocal obligation to respect the religious freedom of others. In the words of the Golden Rule, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<sup>18</sup>Or as the Lord said at the Last Supper, "As I have loved you, ... love one another."<sup>19</sup><br><h2><b>Religious Freedom and Prophecy</b></h2><br>Religious freedom is not only a matter of doctrine; it is a focus of prophecy. You are all familiar with the great description of the last days found in Isaiah 2:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</i><br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:</i>for out of Zion shall go forth the law,<i>and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. ...</i><br><br><i>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>For me, Isaiah's great vision of the last days has taken on greater meaning ever since I read a commentary on this passage by President Harold B. Lee,<sup>21</sup>in which he pointed to an interpretation of the phrase "out of Zion shall go forth the law" that is found in the dedicatory prayer of the Idaho Falls Temple. The relevant portion of that prayer reads as follows:<br><br><i>We pray that kings and rulers and the peoples of all nations under heaven may be persuaded of the blessings enjoyed by the people of this land</i>[the United States]<i>by reason of their freedom under thy guidance and be constrained to adopt</i>similar<i>governmental systems,</i>thus to fulfil the ancient prophecy of Isaiah that "out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."<sup>22</sup><br><br>The Idaho Falls Temple was dedicated on September 23, 1945, immediately following the end of World War II. With that in mind, it is worth reflecting on developments that have occurred since 1945 that bear on the fulfillment of this prophecy.<br><br>First, virtually all currently enforceable international human rights treaties have been adopted since 1945. Moreover, the entire approach to international human rights law has changed. It is now taken for granted that it is legitimate for one sovereign nation to be concerned about the human rights practices of other nations.<sup>23</sup><br><br>At the national level, with only a handful of exceptions, all the countries on earth have adopted their current constitutions since 1945.<sup>24</sup>In short, we are witnessing a remarkable historical process in the field of international law and comparative constitutional law that is the subject of prophecy. This to my mind is one of the many ways that we see the tracings of the Spirit of Christ in history.<br><h2><b>The Significance of Religious Freedom for Church Growth</b></h2><br>Let me now give you a graphic sense for the implications that global religious freedom has for the growth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Look first at a map of the globe that attempts to plot the status of religious freedom around the world. [A map was shown to the audience.] The information in this map is based primarily on the latest annual report on religious freedom provided by the U.S. State Department.<sup>25</sup>The countries shown in gray are countries that have either no constitutional protection of religious freedom or that do not respect this ideal in practice. Some states protect religious freedom to some extent but have significant qualifications that make it difficult to found a new religious community in the country. Restrictions on proselyting are particularly problematic. As the map shows, most of the world now has normal-to-strong protection of religious freedom. No country has a perfect record, but the situation is markedly better than it was even 10 years ago.<br><br>Now look at the map showing the presence of the Church of Jesus Christ worldwide. [A second map was shown.] Darker gray shows the countries where the Church has not yet achieved formal recognition. As you can see, this band of the world includes China and most Islamic nations. Not surprisingly, since the Church always follows the policy of going "in the front door" and entering a country only when it is legal for it to do so,<sup>26</sup>there is a high correlation between low religious freedom and lack of formal presence of the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The third map shows that religious freedom also has considerable significance for general patterns of Church growth. [Another map was shown.] One of the things that is striking from the map is that concentrations are higher in what the scriptures refer to as the "promised land" of the Americas and certain "islands of the sea." Second, one is beginning to see the impact of growth in parts of Africa and the former socialist bloc, where we lacked significant presence until recently. Finally, what the map shows is that Church population remains very thin virtually everywhere. Aside from the United Kingdom, Portugal, and South Korea, there are no countries in these three vast continents of Europe, Africa, or Asia that have as much as one Latter-day Saint per 1,000 in its population. Even in the Americas population exceeds 3 percent only in Chile. Utah remains the only place where the Church is in the majority. The point is that we remain a tiny minority virtually everywhere--so religious freedom protections continue to be of tremendous significance to the Church and its members.<br><h2><b>Global Challenges to Implementing Religious Freedom</b></h2><br>With this background, let me turn now to some of the global challenges to implementing religious freedom. We live in a world that is peopled with an odd mixture of Sherems<sup>27</sup>and Korihors.<sup>28</sup>Sherem, as you remember, is the Book of Mormon figure who criticized prophets and revelations concerning Christ on the basis of fundamentalist or supposedly "orthodox" interpretations of religious texts. At the other pole stands Korihor, the secular anti-Christ who prefigured in his thought the great masters of suspicion of the 19th and 20th centuries--Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.<br><br>Both secularism and fundamentalism or orthodoxy in other traditions can pose profound problems for religious freedom. Further problems emanate from nationalism, ethnicity, and efforts to exploit these for the retention of political power. The arrest of Slobodan Milosevic this past weekend reminds us of the terrible ways a power-hungry leader can use these forces, often manipulating religion in the process to cause terrible devastation.<sup>29</sup>Finally, fears associated with stereotypical images of "dangerous sects"--often fanned by virulent anticult forces<sup>30</sup>--are leading to infringements of religious freedom both in areas of Western Europe and in many other parts of the world.<br><br>The Church has outgrown the "dangerous sect" label, but just barely, and we are constantly at risk that overbroad reactions to supposedly "dangerous" religions will create problems for us as well. Even if this were not the case, however, our own experience with religious persecution should encourage us to stand firm for the rights of the currently less fortunate groups.<br><br>Time is limited, but let me give a few concrete examples of how religious freedom is protected in practice.<br><h2><b>Technical Legal Assistance</b></h2><br>A year ago in January I stopped for three days in Romania because I had a few extra days between two other conferences in Europe. I was aware that very problematic legislation was pending that, among other things, would have made it virtually impossible for the Church of Jesus Christ and many other religious groups to find places of worship in that country. On the first day of my visit I stopped in to see the head of religious affairs, who I had met at a conference a few months earlier. By coincidence, or something more, I was in his office when he received a call indicating that the ruling coalition in Romania would consider whether to withdraw the proposed law from Parliament three days later. Armed with that alert, it was possible to help mobilize response from many groups and government leaders both within and outside of Romania, with the result that the legislation was withdrawn. With a kind of clarity that is seldom so clear-cut, I knew that my three days in Romania had been blessed, and blessed with success.<br><br>More typical of efforts working on legislation has been the experience of the past few weeks working on legislation in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Through this international organization I have been privileged to help provide technical advice to these central Asian republics as they grapple with the difficult problem of dealing with Muslim extremists coming into their countries from other parts of the Muslim world. Their initial reaction has been to clamp down on any transborder activity, restrict missionary work, and make it more difficult for religious groups to be registered so that they can operate legally in the country. OSCE efforts will help contribute to better laws for these countries and may help set patterns that can be utilized elsewhere in the Muslim world.<br><h2><b>The Influence of Academic Conferences and Consultations</b></h2><br>Academic conferences provide an important setting for contributing to religious freedom. Let me describe a few incidents that have grown out of this type of activity. Each fall for the past several years we have held an international conference at BYU dealing with religious freedom. The minister of justice from Peru attended one of these two or three years ago. At the time the Church had just learned that it had exhausted missionary quotas for the year in Peru. A Church official working with visas mentioned this to the minister of justice during a break at the conference. He was quite surprised that such a quota existed at all and indicated he would check into the matter when he returned home. Within a few weeks there were no more missionary quotas in Peru.<br><br>The people who come to BYU for our annual conference are often deeply moved by what they experience here. One of my favorite statements comes from another friend who is currently the head of religious affairs in Albania. He had the opportunity last fall, the day before our academic conference started, to attend the Sunday morning session of general conference in the new Conference Center. Some of you who stood in lines to get into conference this past weekend can appreciate what he saw. This is what he said about the experience:<br><br><i>I have been in</i>[my position as head of religious affairs]<i>for a year, and I have seen a lot. But now I am totally convinced that religion should be an essential part of people's lives. In my country, people line up for bread; today I saw thousands of your people standing in line ... to worship.</i><br><br>This kind of impression changes perspectives on the importance of religious freedom. I returned a month ago from a conference that same man had organized in Albania aimed at pointing the way toward a good law on religious associations that can bless the lives of people in that poor and struggling country for years to come. These stories indicate only a few of the many approaches that can help promote religious freedom.<br><h2><b>Implications</b></h2><br>In the end, what ultimately carries the day is that religious freedom is a true principle. It is a principle of justice. The just and honorable people of this earth recognize its validity. A nation that fails to respect it cannot claim to be just. We must do all in our power to make it a common heritage of all mankind. As the maps shown earlier suggest, the gospel flourishes best under conditions of liberty. God Himself respects this principle. Were it otherwise, He would not be just. His kingdom must be freely chosen. It will not be imposed on anyone anymore than worship in the temple is imposed on nonbelievers. The celestial kingdom is, among other things, a type of worship that will be imposed only on those who have chosen it. But choosing the Lord's kingdom has implications; you cannot arrive in Zion without having chosen to get there. You cannot ascend the mountain of the Lord's house without leaving other things behind. Part of the paradox of freedom is that the Lord allows people not to return to Him. Allowing freedom reflects the nature of a just God, but it cannot compromise divine truth. Just as mercy cannot rob justice, so justice cannot rob truth.<br><br>With this in mind, let me conclude by saying a few things about what the doctrine of religious freedom should mean for each of us. I am convinced that many in your generation will have opportunities to make important contributions to the cause of religious freedom. Hannah Smith, a law student, and Elizabeth Clark, the associate director of the BYU International Center for Law and Religion Studies, each played crucial roles in a recent visit to France to help oppose problematic anticult legislation there. Hannah's husband, John, also a law student, is helping to organize a conference on religious freedom in Ukraine. Others could be mentioned. In time there will be more and more such individuals with knowledge, experience, expertise, and contacts who will be able to help monitor religious freedom developments worldwide and provide assistance and positive contributions when called upon to do so.<br><br>Another young Latter-day Saint lawyer played a crucial role last year in helping to set up a conference on religious freedom with the constitutional court of Azerbaijan. His work had taken him to Azerbaijan at the time. He recognized the opportunity and checked with appropriate authorities. A way was found to organize the conference. I want to underscore the fact that this brother checked with appropriate authorities. Matters of religious freedom often raise a variety of sensitive issues, and it is important before working on these matters to follow the guidance of those holding the keys for the work. There are a number of unfortunate incidents in Church history where well-intended Church members exerted "zeal without knowledge," and set Church progress back by years.<br><br>The story of the founding of the Church in Kazakhstan suggests another role that some adventurous Church families will play. About three years ago a major law firm approached the Law School looking for a business lawyer willing to go to its office in Almaty, Kazakhstan. One of our graduates who had been in practice for several years responded. He and his family have now been in Kazakhstan about three years. Two other expatriate families have moved in. As recently reported in the<i>Church News,</i><sup>31</sup>the Church is now organized in Kazakhstan. These founding families are praying for someone to come with greater fluency in Russian, or with other gifts, so that they can teach and train new Church members more effectively.<br><br>During conference over the past weekend, you heard several talks about the need for couples. Let me tell you a secret. You don't have to wait until you are 65. I have been convinced as long as I have been teaching at the Law School that one of the great waves of missionary work we will see in our lifetime is that performed by families who, like Ammon, decide to go out to the frontiers of the kingdom, dedicated to serving those they find there and hoping to build the kingdom in these locations. This activity will not be for everyone, and there is much to be done on the home front.<sup>32</sup>But some of you will feel this call and will see unparalleled growth in the Church as a result of your faithfulness and witness.<br><br>Consider one other example that suggests another kind of role we all can play. I have a nonmember friend who has played a very important role in a country sensitive enough that I will not name it. He tells me that over the past few years, through a chain of coincidences, he has found himself being befriended by Church members at almost every turn. When he first came to the U.S., the librarian at his university was a Latter-day Saint who helped him immeasurably. Later he studied at another university, where he met additional Latter-day Saints. I heard of him through yet another organization and invited him to our BYU conference. He has subsequently met some Church members in his own country. He was ultimately retained to help secure legal recognition for the Church. In connection with rendering this service, he was asked what he would charge. The lawyer who asked him told me that at the time he was silent for several minutes. Then he said, "I really don't know what to do. I have been benefited so much by friends in your Church that I don't know whether I should charge at all." In the end he was persuaded to take some compensation, but I'm sure it was much less than his help was worth.<br><br>This leads me to a final set of comments about how we should implement the doctrine of religious freedom in our lives. Most of you will not in fact be engaged in legal defense of religious freedom in various parts of the world. For you, what will be most important is the paradoxical part of this doctrine--not the part that underlies all our doctrine and protects our rights to worship but the reciprocal part in which you show tolerance and respect and love for others.<br><br>A few years ago, precisely as much of my work in Eastern Europe was heating up, I became involved in an effort to revise provisions of the Utah Constitution dealing with religious freedom.<sup>33</sup>During the political process I had numerous opportunities to speak around the state. Two things concerned me. First was the number of Church members who felt it was part of their duty as Church members to impose their views on other members of our community. Too many of them, it seemed to me, had forgotten the vital lesson at the core of the paradox of the doctrine of religious freedom: the mere possession of truth does not carry with it a right to impose that truth on others. Second, I heard countless nonmember parents talking about pain their children had suffered because of either intentional or more often unintentional exclusion of their children in our communities.<br><br>I believe that President Hinckley has also sensed their concerns. I don't know if you have paid attention to this, but in virtually every conference for the past few years he has emphasized the importance of being tolerant, of being civil, and of being good neighbors. I cannot repeat his numerous statements on this theme.<sup>34</sup>I can only say that he has been an exemplary advocate of religious freedom. I was immeasurably proud when he greeted the arrival of the Southern Baptist Convention and its plans to "evangelize the Mormons" with counsel that we should be as courteous to them as we would hope others would be to our missionaries.<sup>35</sup>Again and again he has reminded us of our obligation to be true to the hard side of religious freedom: respecting the beliefs of others.<br><br>Let me conclude with a statement that some of you here may have heard President Hinckley give at his devotional on November 4, 1997. In that address he stated:<br><br><i>I hope that</i>[Brigham Young University]<i>will give to you a great sense of tolerance and respect for others not of your faith. The true gospel of Jesus Christ never led to bigotry. It never led to self-righteousness. It never led to arrogance. The true gospel of Jesus Christ leads to brotherhood, to friendship, to appreciation of others, to respect and kindness and love.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>After teaching this principle he told a remarkable story. He had been visited the week before by Shimon Peres, a former prime minister of Israel and one of the elder statesmen of the world. Mr. Peres told him the following story about a Jewish rabbi, which appropriately enough had been told to the prime minister by a Muslim. President Hinckley recounted the story as follows:<br><br><i>A Jewish rabbi ... was conversing with two of his friends. The rabbi asked one of the men, "How do you know when the night is over and the day has begun?"</i><br><br><i>His friend replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish a sheep from a goat, then you know the night is over and the day has begun."</i><br><br><i>The second was asked the same question. He replied, "When you look into the distance and can distinguish an olive tree from a fig tree, that is how you know."</i><br><br><i>They then asked the rabbi how he could tell when the night is over and the day has begun. He thought for a time and then said, "When you look into the distance and see the face of a woman and you can say, 'She is my sister.' And when you look into the distance and see the face of a man and can say, 'He is my brother.' Then you will know the light has come."</i><sup>37</sup><br><br>I am reminded of the first line of a hymn by my great-grandfather, Thomas Durham: "Stars of morning, shout for joy; Sing redemption's mystery."<sup>38</sup><br><br>The morning is coming. You are the stars of morning. We are the stars of morning. We are witnessing the Church coming "forth out of obscurity and out of darkness."<sup>39</sup>Part of "redemption's mystery" is our paradoxical--and yet ultimately not paradoxical--obligation to respect and love and protect the rights of others not of our faith.<br><br>May we sing this mystery well. May we be true children of our Father in Heaven, never forgetting--and never forgetting to live--the song learned in Primary: "As I have loved you, Love one another."<sup>40</sup>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W. Cole Durham, Jr., was a professor at BYU&#39;s J. Reuben Clark Law School when this devotional address was given on 3 April 2001.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Religious liberty is protected by a vast array of constitutions, treaties, and other international human rights instruments. See, e.g., U.S. Constitution, amendment 1;<i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights,</i>adopted and proclaimed by U.N. General Assembly Resolution 217A (III) (1948), art. 18;<i>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</i>adopted and opened for signature by U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2200A (XXI) (1966), art. 18.<br><br>2. See Franklin Delano Roosevelt, "The Four Freedoms," address to 77th Congress, 6 January 1941; available online at &amp;lt;http://www.libertynet.org/~edcivic/fdr.html&amp;gt;.<br><br>3. Bruce R. McConkie,<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985), 655; emphasis added.<br><br>4. The members of the Godhead Themselves worship each other freely as a natural, yet free response to the glory of Their beings. For example, the Father can be seen as worshiping the Son--not a worship of subordination, but surely worship in the sense of love and respect--when He declared, "This is my beloved Son." See 2 Peter 1:17: "For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The members of the Godhead bear witness of each other. See 3 Nephi 11:32: "I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me."<br><br>If C. S. Lewis is correct in pointing out that praise is a natural and willing response to "the worthiest object of all," then it is reasonable to assume that an attitude of worship and praise characterizes the reciprocal relations of members of the Godhead (<i>Reflections on the Psalms</i>[New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1958], 96). As Lewis says, "All enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise. ... I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation" (<i>Reflections,</i>94, 95; see also entire chapter, "A Word About Praising," 90–98).<br><br>5. Revelation 13:8.<br><br>6. 2 Nephi 2:27.<br><br>7. D&amp;amp;C 59:5.<br><br>8. There are countless statements supporting this proposition. Only a few of the more notable ones are listed here. Joseph Smith wrote:<br><br><i>The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is, that we believe that we have a right to embrace all, and every item of truth, without limitation or without being circumscribed or prohibited by the creeds or superstitious notions of men.</i>[Letter to Isaac Galland, written from Liberty Jail, 22 March 1839, in Dean C. Jessee, comp. and ed.,<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984), 420]<br><br>Brigham Young taught:<br><br><i>"Mormonism," so-called, embraces every principle pertaining to life and salvation, for time and eternity. No matter who has it. If the infidel has got truth it belongs to "Mormonism." The truth and sound doctrine possessed by the sectarian world, and they have a great deal, all belong to this church. ... There is no truth but what belongs to the gospel.</i>[<i>JD</i>11:375]<br><br><i>I want to say to my friends that we believe in all good. If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:335]<br><br>Further, he stated:<br><br><i>For me, the plan of salvation must ... circumscribe the knowledge that is upon the face of the earth, or it is not from God. Such a plan incorporates every system of true doctrine on the earth, whether it be ecclesiastical, moral, philosophical, or civil: it incorporates all good laws that have been made from the days of Adam until now; it swallows up the laws of nations, for it exceeds them all in knowledge and purity; it circumscribes the doctrines of the day, and takes from the right and the left, and brings all truth together in one system, and leaves the chaff to be scattered hither and thither.</i>[<i>JD</i>7:148]<br><br>A wonderful passage from John Taylor is worth quoting at length:<br><br><i>We wish to comprehend and embrace all truth and seek for and obtain everything that is calculated to exalt, ennoble and dignify the human family; and wherever we find truth, no matter where, or from what source it may come, it becomes part and parcel of our religious creed, if you please, or our political creed, or our moral creed, or our philosophy, as the case may be, or whatever you may please to term it.</i><br><br><b>We are open for the reception of all truth, of whatever nature it may be, and are desirous to obtain and possess it, to search after it as we would for hidden treasures; and to use all the knowledge God gives to us to possess ourselves of all the intelligence that he has given to others; and to ask at his hands to reveal unto us his will, in regard to things that are the best calculated to promote the happiness and well-being of human society.</b><i>If there are any good principles, any moral philosophy that we have not yet attained to we are desirous to learn them. If there is anything in the scientific world that we do not yet comprehend we desire to become acquainted with it. If there is any branch of philosophy calculated to promote the well-being of humanity, that we have not yet grasped, we wish to possess ourselves of it. If there is anything pertaining to the rule and government of nations, or politics ... that we are not acquainted with, we desire to possess it. If there are any religious ideas, any theological truths, any principles pertaining to God, that we have not learned, we ask mankind, and we pray God, our heavenly Father, to enlighten our minds that we may comprehend, realize, embrace and live up to them as part of our religious faith.</i><b>Thus our ideas and thoughts would extend as far as the wide world spreads, embracing everything pertaining to light, life, or existence pertaining to this world or the world that is to come.</b>[John Taylor,<i>JD</i>14:337; emphasis added]<br><br>Wilford Woodruff stated, "If any man has got a truth that we have not got, let us have it. Truth is what we are after. ... If we have not the truth, that is what we are after, we want it" (<i>JD</i>17:194).<br><br>Joseph F. Smith proclaimed:<br><br><i>We believe in all truth, no matter to what subject it may refer. No sect or religious denomination in the world possesses a single principle of truth that we do not accept or that we will reject. We are willing to receive all truth, from whatever source it may come; for truth will stand, truth will endure.</i>[<i>GD,</i>1]<br><br>Coming down to the present, President Howard W. Hunter stated:<br><br><i>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we seek to bring all truth together. We seek to enlarge the circle of love and understanding among all the people of the earth. Thus we strive to establish peace and happiness, not only within Christianity but among all mankind.</i>["The Gospel--A Global Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, 18]<br><br>Note the interesting linkage here between the notion of embracing all truth and enlarging the circle of love and understanding.<br><br>Finally, President Gordon B. Hinckley has restated the theme as follows:<br><br><i>I love to learn. I relish any opportunity to acquire knowledge. Indeed, I believe in and have vigorously supported, throughout my life, the pursuit of education--for myself and for others. ...</i><br><br><i>The learning process is endless. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds. I believe in the evolution of the mind, the heart, and the soul of humanity. I believe in improvement. I believe in growth. ...</i><br><br><i>... It therefore behooves us, and is our charge, to grow constantly toward eternity in what must be a ceaseless quest for truth. And as we search for truth, let us look for the good, the beautiful, and the positive.</i>[<i>Standing for Something</i>(New York: Times Books, 2000), 59, 62, 64]<br><br>9. Clearly that is part of our obligation, but it is not all. The light of Christ "lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (John 1:9; D&amp;amp;C 93:2), and we should be responsive to that light wherever it shines. In seeking wisdom "out of the best books" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118), my experience has been that although others may not have the fullness of the gospel with the authority and keys that have come with the Restoration, they often understand those portions that they have been given in greater depth. We can benefit immensely from their knowledge. For example, a modern physicist may not understand the fullness of the gospel, but as to the truths of the fundamental structure of matter, he no doubt knows more than most of us, and to the extent his knowledge corresponds to reality, he has knowledge of truths that are embraced by our religion. The same is true in other domains of knowledge. In this regard it is worth remembering Brigham Young's statement:<br><br><i>Our religion measures, weighs, and circumscribes all the wisdom in the world--all that God has ever revealed to man. God has revealed all the truth that is now in the possession of the world, whether it be scientific or religious.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:162]<br><br>10. When Nauvoo was founded, the Prophet Joseph Smith stated that he designed its charter "for the salvation of the Church, and on principles so broad, that every honest man might dwell secure under its protective influence<i>without distinction of sect or party"</i>(<i>HC</i>4:249; emphasis added). In this same spirit, the city council of Nauvoo passed one of the early "anti–hate crime" ordinances in American history. Section 1 of the ordinance read as follows:<br><br><i>Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Nauvoo, that the Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Latter-day Saints, Quakers, Episcopals, Universalists, Unitarians, Mohammedans, and all other religious sects and denominations whatever, shall have free toleration, and equal privileges, in this city; and should any person be guilty of ridiculing, and abusing or otherwise depreciating another in consequence of his religion, or of disturbing or interrupting any religious meeting within the limits of this city, he shall, on conviction thereof before the Mayor or Municipal Court, be considered a disturber of the public peace, and fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both, at the discretion of said Mayor or Court.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:306]<br><br>Significantly, Brigham Young clearly taught that even during the Millennium there will be just and honorable people of other faiths who will be protected in their rights to freedom of religion (see<i>JD</i>2:309).<br><br>11.<i>HC</i>5:498.<br><br>12. See D&amp;amp;C 121:37. For an example of Joseph Smith's critical view of the tendency of the persecuted to assume the role of oppressors, see his comments on intolerance in Massachusetts (<i>HC</i>2:464–65).<br><br>13. For an excellent discussion of this principle, see John K. Carmack,<i>Tolerance: Principles, Practices, Obstacles, Limits</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1993).<br><br>14. Matthew 16:25; see also 10:39; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33.<br><br>15. D&amp;amp;C 64:10.<br><br>16. Matthew 22:39.<br><br>17. Matthew 5:44–45.<br><br>18. See Matthew 7:12: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." A version of this great teaching of the Master is found in virtually every major religious tradition. See, e.g.,<i>The Analects of Confucius</i>15:23 ("What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others"--Confucianism);<i>Mahabharata</i>5:1517 ("This is the sum of duty: do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you"--Hinduism); Talmud, Shabbat 31a ("What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow man"--Judaism);<i>Udanavarga</i>5:18 ("Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful"--Buddhism);<i>Dadistan-i Dinik</i>94:5 ("That nature only is good when it shall not do unto another whatever is not good for its own self"--Zoroastrianism);<i>Forty Hadith of an-Nawawi</i>13 ("Not one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself"--Islamism);<i>Tablets of Bahá&#39;u&#39;lláh</i>71:26 ("Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself"--Bahaism);<i>Sutrakritanga</i>1.11.33 ("A man should wander about treating all creatures as he himself would be treated"--Jainism); Guru Arjan Dev 259,<i>Guru Granth Sahib</i>("Don't create enmity with anyone as God is within everyone"--Sikhism).<br><br>19. John 13:34.<br><br>20. Isaiah 2:2–5; emphasis added.<br><br>21. Harold B. Lee, "The Way to Eternal Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1971, 15; quoted in Jay M.

See Henry J. Steiner and Philip Alston,<i>International Human Rights in Context: Law, Politics, Morals</i>(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), 148–65. Moreover, a number of regional international treaties have been adopted. Most notable of these is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The European Court of Human Rights, which monitors compliance with this convention, is now the most significant constitutional court in the world. It has approximately 800,000,000 people within its jurisdiction, including all the former socialist bloc countries with the exception of those in Central Asia, and its pronouncements on human rights issues are now given effect throughout this vast region. See P. van Dijk and G. J. H. van Hoof,<i>Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights,</i>3rd ed. (The Hague: Kluwer Law, 1998), 1–2, 31–36; see also &amp;lt;http://press.coe.int/press2/press.asp?B=30,0,0,0,0&amp;amp;M=http://press.coe.int/cp/2001/226a(2001).htm&amp;gt; (Council of Europe press release).

To the best of my knowledge, the only exceptions are the following 10 countries, which adopted their constitutions prior to World War II: the United States in 1788, Norway in 1814, Liberia in 1847, Luxembourg in 1868, Switzerland in 1874, Tonga in 1875, Australia in 1901, Liechtenstein in 1921, Lebanon in 1926, and Ireland in 1937. The only other exceptions are the United Kingdom, Bhutan, Israel, and Libya, which do not have written constitutions.<br><br>25. U.S. State Department,<i>2000 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom</i>(5 September 2000) (available online at http://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/irf/irf_rpt/irf_index.html). The differentiation between "normal" and "strong" protection is subjective, based on personal perceptions and interactions with comparative constitutional law experts.<br><br>26. "Wherever we go, we go in the front door. Our representatives honor the laws of the nations to which they go and teach the people to be good citizens" ("President Hinckley Addresses World Affairs Council,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1999, 75). Similar statements have been regularly made by other Church leaders as well. See, e.g., Spencer W. Kimball, quoted in Martin B. Hickman,<i>David Matthew Kennedy: Banker, Statesman, Churchman</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1987), 342; also see Dallin H. Oaks and Lance B. Wickman, "The Missionary Work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," in John Witte, Jr., and Richard C. Martin, eds.,<i>Sharing the Book: Religious Perspectives on the Rights and Wrongs of Proselytism</i>(Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books, 1999), 270.<br><br>27. Jacob 7.<br><br>28. Alma 30.<br><br>29. See "Siege Ends as Milosevic Surrenders,"<i>Deseret News,</i>1 April 2001, A1.<br><br>30. W.

"Kazakhstan Recognizes Church,"<i>Church News,</i>17 February 2001, 5.<br><br>32. See Bruce D. Porter, "Building the Kingdom"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 80–81. Elder Porter provided a vital reminder that although<br><br><i>sometimes, perhaps, we may be inclined to see the building of the kingdom as something that takes place beyond the horizon, far away from our own branch or ward. In truth, the Church advances both by outward expansion and by inward refinement. ...</i><br><br><i>We do not have to be called to serve far from home, nor do we have to hold a prominent place in the Church or in the world to build up the Lord's kingdom.</i>[Porter, "Building the Kingdom," 80]<br><br>33. Because of what I regard as one of the great decisions in the history of our state supreme court,<i>Society of Separationists v. Whitehead,</i>it ultimately became unnecessary to pursue the constitutional amendment in question (870 P.2d 916 [Utah 1993]).<br><br>34. See, e.g., Gordon B. Hinckley, "A Time of New Beginnings,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2000, 87–88; "The Work Moves Forward,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1999, 4–5; and "We Bear Witness of Him,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 4–6. One statement that seemed particularly impressive to me is the following:<br><br><i>In many communities where our people are in the majority, accusations are heard that we are intolerant, that we display an attitude of self-righteousness, and that we are uncooperative in advancing causes which are for the common good. ... It has been reported that some parents, out of a desire to protect their children, have told them that they should not associate in school with those not of their faith.</i><br><br><i>It seems anomalous that some would keep their sons and daughters from so doing while they are in the elementary schools, and yet make great sacrifice when they grow older to send them into the mission field.</i><br><br><i>Let us not forget that we believe in being benevolent and in doing good to all men. I am convinced that we can teach our children effectively enough that we need not fear that they will lose their faith while being friendly and considerate with those who do not subscribe to the doctrine of this Church. Let us reach out to those in our community who are not of our faith. Let us be good neighbors, kind and generous and gracious. Let us be involved in good community causes. There may be situations, there will be situations, where, with serious moral issues involved, we cannot bend on matters of principle. But in such instances we can politely disagree without being disagreeable. We can acknowledge the sincerity of those whose positions we cannot accept. We can speak of principles rather than personalities. In those causes which enhance the environment of the community, and which are designed for the blessing of all of its citizens, let us step forward and be helpful. An attitude of self-righteousness is unbecoming a Latter-day Saint.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>661–62]<br><br>35. See, e.g., "'We Are a Biblical Church, Atlanta Members Told,'"<i>Church News,</i>23 May 1998, 5, quoting President Gordon B. Hinckley as saying:<br><br><i>I don't know how many will be there</i>[at the Southern Baptist Convention].<i>I have heard everything from 12,000 to 18,000. I hope there are 20,000 of them. I hope they have a wonderful time. I hope that our people are hospitable toward them and will reach out the hand of fellowship and show love for them.</i><br><br>36. Gordon B.

<br>
I am pleased to be with you today. This is a very humbling moment. I can assure you that I have given much thought and prayer to this assignment so that I could say a few words that would be of benefit to you this morning.<br><br>It has been my pleasure and honor to be at this great university for the past 40 years. My interaction with the students has been mostly as a coach. I did, however, spend seven-and-a-half years as a bishop and high councilor in a student ward and stake, which I consider the most enjoyable and rewarding Church assignments of my life.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants it reads:<br><br><i>Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand.</i><br><br><i>Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels to commit unto you;</i><br><br><i>Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked;</i><br><br><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of my Spirit, which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18]<br><br>We have all seen pictures of Moroni dressed in his armor including the breastplate and helmet. It is a little like a football player dressed in full uniform with all the required pads, shoes, and helmet. They are both dressed for protection from their adversaries. The football player has to withstand the blocks, tackles, and other hits he will take while practicing or playing a game. The Lord has offered us protective armor to use in our battles, and that is what I would like to discuss today.<br><br>As the scripture states, we should have our "loins girt about with truth." As members of the Church, we must seek truth in all areas, be it spiritual, educational, scientific, or in the social and moral settings of society. If we don't seek truth, we will not find it or recognize it. Probably the most profound search for truth was Joseph Smith's search for the true church. Just think where we would be today if he had not had that hunger for truth.<br><br>To recognize truth, to be truthful, and to be honest with others, we first have to be honest and truthful with ourselves. Self-deception is deadly. Deceiving ourselves leaves us open to Satan's ways--such as blaming others for our poor choices, justifying a little white lie, and cheating on a test. However, being honest with ourselves allows us to learn who we are and what we are all about. It helps our minds and hearts be open to further truth and inspiration. In a First Presidency message, Spencer W. Kimball said, "If men are really humble, they will realize that they<i>discover,</i>but do not<i>create,</i>truth" ("Absolute Truth,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1978, 34; emphasis in original).<br><br>We all know of the two plans of salvation presented to God by His sons Lucifer and Jehovah. A great battle commenced between their followers, and even though Lucifer was cast out, the war between the forces of good and evil has continued to this day. The temptations of these evil forces are greater today than ever before, but truth can make us free of Satan's deceptions.<br><br>The scripture continues with "having on the breastplate of righteousness." Being righteous means being upright, moral, and virtuous. It is something we have to work on every day. We have to keep progressing or we will regress. We have to continue studying, praying, and trying to live the Lord's teachings and commandments to gain and maintain a life of righteousness. I believe righteousness also includes service to others. A righteous person is aware of others' needs and acts on that awareness through service.<br><br>We are in an era of dot-coms, computers, and the Internet. It is easy to get caught up in all these wonderful inventions and let them control our lives, forgetting about the world and humanity around us. Our human interaction and having compassion and concern for each other are far more important than technology in trying to live Christlike lives.<br><br>A friend shared with me this profound creed that says it well:<br><br><i>Remember to be gentle with yourself and others. We are all children of chance, and none can say why some fields will blossom while others lay brown beneath the August sun.</i><br><br><i>Care for those around you. Look past your differences. Their dreams are no less than yours, their choices in life no more easily made.</i><br><br><i>And give. Give in any way you can, of whatever you possess. To give is to love. To withhold is to wither. Care less for your harvest than for how it is shared, and your life will have meaning and your heart will have peace.</i>[Kent Nerburn,<i>Letters to My Son: Reflections on Becoming a Man</i>(San Rafael, California: New World Library, 1993), 211–12]<br><br>This is a beautifully stated philosophy and one that I believe we should incorporate into our lives as we continue our quest for righteousness.<br><br>The next phrase of the scripture is "and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace." Preparation brings peace as it frees us to pursue our goals. In this era of violence in every medium, peace is a treasured feeling and one we want to keep with us as much as possible.<br><br>To me, preparation is the key to success in any endeavor. I have often heard the phrase "He [or she] has a great will to win." What it should say is, "He [or she] has a great will to prepare." The greatest athletes are not always the fastest, strongest, or most gifted athletically. The greatest players are those who have the ability to recognize their potential and prepare themselves to meet that potential.<br><br>On a Saturday afternoon in the filled stadium with the excitement of the band, the cheerleaders, and the crowd, a player can have all the desire or will to win in the world, but it will be for naught if he hasn't prepared. The same is true in our personal lives. We can have the desire to do something well, even to gain a strong testimony of the gospel, but it will be for naught if we are not willing to work, study, and prepare. Every one of us has the potential to successfully achieve our goals in life, but most goals won't be realized without effort on our part.<br><br>The next item of protection in the armor of God is "taking the shield of faith." In the Book of Mormon, the warriors used shields to protect them from the swords, spears, arrows, and other weapons of their foes. In football, the quarterback has an offensive line that forms a pocket in front of him to shield him from the opponents. Faith is our shield, our pocket of protection. It is our shield from the many weapons that Satan bombards us with every day, such as despair, indecisiveness, procrastination, depression, and anger. Faith lifts us up, gives us hope, and makes seemingly insurmountable challenges possible to overcome.<br><br>Life can be discouraging, and it isn't always fair. But with faith and an eternal perspective, we can make it through the hard times. We tend to think that we are the only ones with problems; in reality, everyone has problems, even President Hinckley. He said, "My life has been rich because it has been filled with problems to solve and associations to savor" (Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Standing for Something</i>[New York: Times Books, 2000], xi).<br><br>Sean Covey is the son of Stephen R. Covey of "seven habits" fame and grew up in our ward. He and the other members of his family had those seven habits stamped across their foreheads from the day they were born. And they knew how to succeed. They are a marvelous family. Sean was a great high school football player and led his team to the state championship. He was very highly recruited. It came down to us and Stanford. Sean elected to come to BYU because he wanted to lead us to another national championship.<br><br>His freshman year he did well with the junior varsity squad, and then he left on a mission. When he came home, he was excited and eager to resume his football career. He worked hard, prepared himself physically and mentally, and halfway through his sophomore year became our starting quarterback. After winning all but one of the last few games we played that season, everything looked like it was right on track for him.<br><br>The next year, his junior year, he was named the starting quarterback but sustained a concussion against Wyoming in the first game. He came back the next game, and we beat a nationally ranked Texas team. But then he had shoulder and knee problems throughout the year. The team suffered a little bit, and he had to have surgery after the season, which prevented him from going through spring practice.<br><br>At the time we had a young freshman quarterback named Ty Detmer, who had an outstanding spring. It became evident that he might be the better of the two, but because Sean was the starter the previous year, we wanted to give him a good chance to fight for the starting position when they returned in the fall. After fall camp, it was evident that Ty was the better quarterback of the two.<br><br>Before any announcement was made, I brought Sean into the office and explained our decision to him. He didn't speak for a couple of minutes, but finally he said, "Coach, I don't think this is fair. I've worked hard, prepared well, and done everything I was supposed to do to return as the starting quarterback. This is going to be a much better team than the others that I've played on."<br><br>I had to agree with Sean.<br><br>After a moment, he continued, "Coach, this isn't fair, but I want you to know that I will be at every practice. I will be at every meeting, and I will prepare myself every week as if I were the starting quarterback. I will be ready whenever you need me."<br><br>He did just that. Unfortunately for Sean, Ty went on to have a great year--the greatest of any sophomore quarterback in NCAA history. Sean rarely got in a game again.<br><br>Life, in this instance, was not fair to Sean, but he chose to do his very best and to contribute to the success of the team in any way he could. He was, and is, a young man of faith, of righteousness, and of prayer, with an eternal perspective on life. These attributes help him to make the right choices and to use the difficulties he encounters as stepping-stones to progress.<br><br>The scripture continues: "And take the helmet of salvation." Can you imagine how it would be to play a game of football without a helmet? It is the same as trying to live in this world of turmoil without the plan of salvation. Our understanding of this plan gives meaning to our lives, a knowledge of why we are here, and hope for where we can be in the next life. The promise of exaltation and eternal families gives us a constant goal to strive for--thus protecting us from and helping us to avoid much of the evil that is out there in the world.<br><br>Think of the amazing sacrifice the Lord made for each of us that we might have salvation from Adam's transgression and from our own sins. Think of the intense suffering He bore in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross to fulfill His mission on this earth. Think of the overwhelming love He must have for us to have completed the earthly part of His ministry in such a way. It is the greatest gift that will ever be given, and we must use it daily to repent, to make wise choices, to always have that eternal perspective, and to work toward exaltation.<br><br>The last part of the protective equipment the scripture mentions is "the sword of my Spirit." The most powerful part of our protective armor, the most powerful weapon we have against evil, is the Spirit of the Lord. He has promised us that we will have His Spirit with us if we are trying to do as He has asked. With the Spirit we know better how to use the rest of our armor to full advantage. As we do that, we can then feel the Spirit even stronger and exercise its power on a daily basis. Elder Loren C. Dunn expounded on this:<br><br><i>We keep the commandments and teachings of the gospel in order to condition us spiritually. It is not a matter of how many laws we keep and how many we do not keep. We keep the commandments because they are the laws that govern the Spirit. The Spirit in turn will sanctify us, condition us spiritually, and eventually prepare us to live in the kingdom where God is.</i>["The Spirit Giveth Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, 70–71]<br><br>In Ephesians 6:18, the armor includes "praying always." In the wars described in the Book of Mormon, it took a long time for the soldiers in the field to communicate with their leaders back at headquarters when they were in trouble, needed supplies or guidance, or even wanted to tell of triumphs and victories. We, on the other hand, can have constant and instant communication with our leader, the Lord, through prayer. Prayer is the stabilizing weapon we have against Satan. The more constant our prayers, the less opportunity there is for him to find a crack in our armor.<br><br>Prayer is a special one-to-one, soul-to-soul communication with our Heavenly Father, a time when we can ask for help in our battles, small and large. It is also a time to thank Him for His help as we safely come through each struggle, as He helps us keep our armor intact, as He blesses us while we try to keep progressing. One thing I had to learn the hard way was that prayer shouldn't be a last resort. Too often we depend only on our own skills or the help of others when prayer should be a part of every solution. Perhaps when we need Him, He won't recognize our voice, as in this anonymous poem variously known as "Answered Prayer," "Cowboy's Prayer," "Cowboy Story," or "Wyoming Cowboy Poetry":<br><br><i>Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence.<br>The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled gray and dense.</i><br><br><i>As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go,<br>The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.</i><br><br><i>When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart.<br>From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.</i><br><br><i>So Jake did what most of us do if we would have been there.<br>He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.</i><br><br><i>As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck.<br>They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.</i><br><br><i>Now Jake had been around in life and done his share of roamin',<br>But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked--It looked just like Wyomin'!</i><br><br><i>Oh, there were some differences, of course, but just some minor things.<br>One place had simply disappeared--the town they called Rock Springs.</i><br><br><i>The BLM had been shut down, and there weren't no grazin' fees,<br>And the wind in Rawlins and Cheyenne was now a gentle breeze.</i><br><br><i>The Park and Forest Service folks--they didn't fare so well.<br>They'd all been sent to fight some fire in a wilderness called Hell.</i><br><br><i>Though Heaven was a real nice place, Jake had a wondering mind,<br>So he saddled up and lit a shuck, not knowin' what he'd find.</i><br><br><i>Then one day up in Cody, on a cold fall afternoon,<br>He saw St. Peter coming, and he knew he'd be there soon.</i><br><br><i>Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter.<br>Now, this line, it ain't needed, but it helps with rhyme and meter.</i><br><br><i>So they set and talked a minute or two, or maybe it was three.<br>Nobody was keepin' score--in Heaven time is free.</i><br><br><i>"I've always heard," Jake said to Peter, "that God will answer prayers,<br>But one time I asked for help, well, He just plain wasn't there.</i><br><br><i>"Does God answer prayers of some, and ignore the prayers of others?<br>That don't seem exactly square--I know all men are brothers.</i><br><br><i>"Or does He randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?<br>Maybe it's the time of day, the weather, or the season.</i><br><br><i>"Now I ain't tryin' to act smart; it's just the way I feel,<br>And I was wonderin', could you tell, What the heck's the deal?"</i><br><br><i>Peter listened very patiently, and when ol' Jake was done,<br>There was a smile of recognition, and he said, "So, you're the one!</i><br><br><i>"That day your truck, it wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a-flying,<br>You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a-trying.</i><br><br><i>"A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,<br></i><i>But, you know, Jake, we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.</i><br><br><i>"And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota--<br>He didn't recognize your voice, and started a truck in North Dakota."</i><br><br>It's not always easy to recognize the Lord's blessings or His answers, but our faith and the Spirit can help us do so. Each of us has our own individual journey to make in life, and it isn't always a smooth ride. But prayer can make it bearable and give us the strength to keep moving. President Hinckley likes to use a wonderful quote from the newspaper editor and columnist Jenkin Lloyd Jones:<br><br><i>Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he has been robbed.</i><br><br><i>Most putts don't drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. ...</i><br><br><i>Life is like an old-time rail journey--delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed.</i><br><br><i>The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.</i>["Big Rock Candy Mountains,"<i>Deseret News,</i>12 June 1973, A4]<br><br>I would like to add one more item of protection to help us foil the adversary: surrounding ourselves with good people. Remember those special young men, the sons of Helaman, who had been taught by their mothers to have total faith in the Lord and came to the aid of their people in war? We never know when we are going to have a chink in our armor and need stripling warriors there who will help us, who will lift us, who will help us repair that crack.<br><br>One of the most famous runs that Steve Young made with the 49ers was in the game where he lost his helmet. Did he stop to pick it up? No, he kept running down field full bore, leaving himself open to serious injury. Steve had a couple of little chinks in his football armor. One, he didn't appreciate the wisdom of the slide, often playing like a blocker--taking on linebackers and trying to flatten them. And sometimes--actually a lot of times--his shield, his pocket, was shattered, and he was flattened by a 300-pound lineman. Fortunately Steve had good people around him to help him back up, to help him replace his chinks, to help him evaluate and repair his body, and to help him make wise decisions--like that of retiring. We all need our stripling warriors--family, friends, and leaders who have high values, who are loyal and fearless in their righteous desires, who know truth, and who have immense faith. I hope we can all be stripling warriors for others as they discover the cracks in their armor.<br><br>When we take upon ourselves the whole armor of God, it is much like the football player going into the game with all of his protective gear on. It gives him self-confidence and a freedom to play to his full ability. Take off his helmet or his pads, and he will become tentative in his playing and will render himself ineffective.<br><br>The struggle to find ourselves is very real, and that is why God has given us this armor: that we might recognize truth and understand ourselves, that we might have faith because of the gift of salvation, that we might attain righteousness to help us overcome the evils of life. If we don't use this armor we've been given, we will, like the football player, become tentative in our choices and decisions and leave ourselves open to the adversary.<br><br>As a high school and college coach for close to 50 years, I have seen this tendency evidenced as we place limitations on ourselves--more so than those imposed by others. It may be because of fear, lack of self-confidence, or a lack of eternal vision. We were placed here on the earth to be successful in all our chosen endeavors. I have a plaque in my office that says "Success is a journey and not a destination." We don't become successful and then just stay there. We either move forward or backward. True success is measured by what we choose to do with our lives, not by how many yards we gain running the ball or how rich we are or if we have a powerful position. Such measuring sticks are not eternal and can put chinks in our armor. They always have a negative effect on the way we perceive ourselves and our worth. President Hinckley said, "The course of our lives is not determined by great, awesome decisions. Our direction is set by the little<br>day-to-day choices which chart the track on which we run" ("Watch the Switches in Your Life,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1973, 91).<br><br>The armor of God we've been given is far more powerful than any earthly armor. I think of the story of David and Goliath. Goliath was not only huge in stature, but he was equipped with every conceivable armor then known. David, however, was armed only with the armor of God and a slingshot. He was ridiculed by his opponent.<br><br><i>Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</i><br><br><i>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; . . . that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</i>[1 Samuel 17:45–46]<br><br>We face intimidation in many ways during our life. It may be the bully in the neighborhood as a child or the powerful corporation as we strive to make our way in the business world. It may be through peer pressure: to be popular is to go along with the crowd; to really show your love, you have to give your all; to be competitive, you have to take steroids. It may be our neighbor's money and power and our lack of them. The armor of God can help us bring down any intimidator, no matter what weapons he is using. The armor of God gives us eternal perspective, the strength of faith, truth, prayer, and the promise of salvation. We need never be afraid to stand up for ourselves and our God if we are protected with His armor.<br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</i>[Ephesians 6:12–13]<br><br>It is my prayer that we will all put on the whole armor of God, that we will work at maintaining that armor through good choices, faith, prayer, study, service, and relying on the Spirit. I pray that each of us will come to truthfully know ourselves and our potential in the Lord's sight, and that through that insight we will find joy, peace, and success in our lives.<br><br>It has been my great pleasure to be at this great university, to have a lot of things happen to us that we never really expected. It has been great, but the true blessings that I have in my life have always been and will always be the testimony that I have of the gospel of Jesus Christ; my wife, Patty; and my children. These are my most important possessions. I bear testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>LaVell Edwards, retired BYU head football coach, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 10 April 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> and Technology - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to speak to you today. However, I am somewhat humbled by this opportunity. This reminds me of an instance about 20 years ago, when I responded to an editorial that I heard on WGN-Radio in Chicago. Shortly after sending a written response to the station, I received a call indicating that they would like me to come in and tape my response for broadcast. Luckily I wore a suit to the station, because when I arrived, I was informed that the taping would take place on the set for the evening news program, with a teleprompter. It hadn't crossed my mind that WGN was both a radio and a TV station and that my editorial response was to be televised. Needless to say, I was a little nervous.<br><br>My remarks today will focus on theology and technology. I have chosen these topics for obvious reasons. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a BYU faculty member as well, I have a great interest in and commitment to theology. And, as director of BYU's School of Technology, I also have a great interest in and commitment to technology.<br><br>I believe that technology and theology are linked--intertwined, if you will. I will share some perspectives of each, after which I will discuss the interrelationships.<br><br>We live in a wonderful time, a time when the marvels of technology have, in most instances, made life and work much easier--albeit more complex. President James E. Faust, at the October 1999 general priesthood meeting, noted this. He said:<br><br><i>The miracles of modern technology have brought efficiency into our lives in ways not dreamed of a generation ago, yet with this new technology has come a deluge of new challenges to our morals and our values. Some tend to rely more on technology than on theology.</i>[James E. Faust, "Of Seeds and Soils,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 47–48]<br><br>Many in our global society are relying more on technology, its products, and its benefits than they are relying on theology and God. This concern is not limited to President Faust and our church. To counteract the detrimental effects of technology, some religious groups have made the relationship between technology and theology a point of doctrine. For example, the Amish reject many modern technological advances like automobiles, television, electricity, and modern clothing fashions in an attempt to maintain a strong focus on God.<br><br>Of course we need to realize that theology clearly benefits from technology. President Faust further stated:<br><br><i>I hasten to add that scientific knowledge, the marvels of communication, and the wonders of modern medicine have come from the Lord to enhance His work throughout the world. As an example, the Church's FamilySearch® Web site has more than seven million hits a day.</i>[Faust, "Of Seeds," 48]<br><br>There is no doubt that technology benefits and complements the Church. Although I will discuss the benefits in more detail later, it must also be understood that technology is like a two-way street: it goes both ways--that is, it has both positive and negative effects. And though technology can be used to benefit theology in its purpose of bringing to pass the eternal life and exaltation of mankind, likewise, technology can be used by the adversary to benefit his purposes, which are to destroy goodness and to stop eternal progression. Let me quote President Faust again:<br><br><i>But Satan, of course, is aware of this great progress in technology and likewise takes advantage of it for his purposes, which are to destroy and despoil. He delights in the pornography on the Internet and the sleaze in many of our movies and television shows.</i>[Faust, "Of Seeds," 48]<br><br>Technology is a very powerful tool that can be used by both sides in the battle for salvation.<br><h2><b>Technology</b></h2><br>At this point I would like to discuss technology. My comments may seem a little academic; however, I will try to refrain from technobabble--which is using confusing technical jargon.<br><br>What is technology? If we were to conduct a Jay Leno–type "Jaywalking" survey, asking people on the street what<i>technology</i>means, I would predict that more than 95 percent of the respondents would answer with the word "computers" or maybe "the Internet" or something closely related to either computers or the Internet.<br><br>Does technology equate to or mean only computers? I think not. Today there does not seem to be a clear definition of what technology is. The term has many meanings. To some it means applied science; to others it means gadgets, devices, and machines; to yet others it means a complex social enterprise or a process. What then is technology? First, let's look at the dictionary definition, which is:<br><br><i>1. The application of tools and methods; 2. Method of applying technical knowledge; 3. Sum of a society's or culture's knowledge.</i>[<i>Encarta World English Dictionary,</i>1999, s.v. "technology"]<br><br>There are two words in this definition that resonate--<i>knowledge</i>and<i>application.</i>It is interesting to note that when John H. Gibbons was the director of the U.S. Congress' Office of Technology Assessment, he defined technology as "applied human knowledge," which, by the way, is probably the most succinct definition of the word<i>technology</i>(in<i>Technology Education: The New Basic</i>[Albany, New York: Delmar Publishers, 1988], videocassette).<br><br>To help gain a greater understanding of what technology is, let me share with you some results of discussions and debates that five doctoral students, a new assistant professor, and I had about 14 years ago when we were at the University of Illinois. This technology study group met weekly over a two-year period with the express purpose of creating an innovative program to prepare a unique kind of technology teacher for the 21st century. (See Scott D. Johnson and Thomas L. Erekson, "Technology's Role in Vocational Education Reform,"<i>Illinois Vocational Education Journal</i>44, no. 1 (1988):11–15.)<br><br>Our discussions about technology were spirited, and, as I recall, our vision became more focused as we examined characterizations of technology. In a scholarly paper about the philosophy of technology, Dr. Rodney E. Frey, then a technology education faculty member at Bethel College in North Newton, Kansas, a Mennonite institution, citing Carl Mitcham's work, identified four major characterizations of technology.<br><br>They are technology<br><br>*as object,<br><br>*as process,<br><br>*as knowledge, and<br><br>*as volition.<br><br>(See Rodney E. Frey, "Is There a Philosophy of Technology?" paper presented at the meeting of the Mississippi Valley Industrial Teacher Education Conference, Chicago, Illinois, November 1987; see also Carl Mitcham, "Types of Technology," in<i>Research in Philosophy and Technology,</i>vol. 1 [Greenwich, Connecticut: Jai Press, 1978], 229–94.)<br><br>Now let me briefly describe these four characterizations.<br><br>The first level of characterization views technology as an object or a thing. At this level technology is viewed as tools, machines, and devices that are produced and used by humans. In fact, it could easily be argued that technology as an object is the layperson's definition. Again, many people view technology and computers as the same thing. However, a computer is a technological device.<br><br>The second level of characterization views technology as a process or a system. This characterization suggests that technology is the application or the use of devices in systems. The focus is not on the device or the object; rather, it is on the application in a system or process. The Internet is a good example of a technological system at this level of characterization.<br><br>The third level of characterization views technology as knowledge. This perspective suggests that technology has its own unique knowledge base and modes of inquiry that underlie technological objects and systems. Some would suggest that, from this perspective, technology is a new academic discipline--and, in fact, I wrote an article in the early 1990s in support of this perspective. Do you remember the dictionary definition of technology? Part of that definition said that it was "a society's or culture's knowledge."<br><br>The fourth level of characterization views technology as volition or human will. In this characterization, the objects, processes, and knowledge of technology all become means to extend the capability to meet human needs and human wants. Volition means the ability to make conscious choices about which technologies to develop and to use. It also suggests that humans can control, or be controlled by, technology.<br><br>Our Illinois study group--after further analysis, discussion, and debate--determined that in its simplest form, technology is a synergistic noumenon that occurs through the interaction of knowing, thinking, and doing while extending human capabilities. Now, if any of you know what a noumenon is, you get an A for the day. I'll tell you what it is: A noumenon is an object that is conceived by reason, and is consequentially thinkable but not knowable by the senses. In effect, a noumenon is a phenomenon that cannot be seen. Technology then is not just knowledge. It is not just doing and it is not just thinking. It is the intersection or the interaction of all three.<br><br>From the perspective of technology as a noumenon, the physical phenomenon of technology was deemed by this Illinois study group as "technological activity." What most people consider technology to be, from our perspective, is actually technological activity.<br><br>Whether my definition of technology is accurate or not, technology suggests action or interaction, but it is not just application or doing. Technology should be thoughtful action based on core human values with the purpose of extending capabilities. As I said earlier, technology is applied human knowledge--or it might also be considered human ingenuity in action.<br><br>Another aspect of technology is that it is often irreversible. That is, once deployed, it is difficult to go back or to go without it. Take, for example, automobiles. How many of us want to go back to the days of the horse and buggy? Do you have any idea how many tons of horse manure were generated daily by the cabs in New York City at the turn of the last century? Would we want to do without things like power door locks and remote keyless entry? What about computers or photocopiers? Or CD players? I certainly do not want to go back to when technology was not as provident as it is today.<br><h2><b>Theology</b></h2><br>Now I would like to talk about theology and then about the relationship between theology and technology. Since I have tried to define technology, let's begin by defining theology. The dictionary defines<i>theology</i>as:<br><br><i>1. The study of religion, especially the Christian faith and God's relation to the world; 2. A religious theory, school of thought, or system of belief; 3. A specialized course of religious training.</i>[<i>Encarta World English Dictionary,</i>1999, s.v. "theology"]<br><br>As students at BYU, you are involved in studying religion, especially the Christian faith. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we espouse a religious theory and we have a system of belief. We have some beliefs that are common among religions and we have some beliefs that are unique to our Church.<br><br>I do not have time today to list all of our beliefs. However, the basics of our theology are described in the Articles of Faith, 13 brief statements that outline our beliefs. Many of us memorized all 13 when we were in Primary and then recited them to our bishops prior to Primary graduation. Additional aspects of our theology come from the standard works and the words of the living prophets and apostles.<br><h2><b>The Relationship Between Theology and Technology</b></h2><br>Is there a relationship between theology and technology? It is clear that technological activity--technology, if you will--has had, and will continue to have, significant impact on the major institutions of society--which are family; education; economics; politics, including the military; and religion.<br><br>There is no doubt that technology has changed the institutions of society and that the rate of change is accelerating. Elder L. Tom Perry stated that "as technology sweeps through every facet of life, changes are occurring so rapidly that it can be difficult for us to keep our lives in balance" (<i>Living with Enthusiasm</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 22). Individuals and families are being affected as a result of technology and technological changes.<br><br>Many examples could be cited at this point, but I would like to focus on the generation gap. Although there has always been a generation gap, it appears that the gap is widening as a result of technology. Due to the accelerating pace of change, the world that you have grown up in is significantly different from the one your parents grew up in, and your children's world will have even greater differences from your world because of the pace and scope of technological advancement.<br><br>I went to high school and served my mission in the 1960s, a time that was very different from today. In many respects I grew up in the last stages of the Industrial Age, whereas my children have grown up in the Information Age. A case in point is this: One of my favorite songs from my high school days was the Beach Boys' song "Little Deuce Coupe." My children do not know what a little deuce coupe is, and, furthermore, they probably don't care to know. Likewise, when my son, Bob, was playing in a heavy-metal garage band, I really did not understand or appreciate the electronics of music. And I especially did not appreciate music amplification. By the way, we did not let Bob's band practice in our garage!<br><br>Technology does not have to widen the generation gap if we embrace the concept of lifelong learning. My father, another Bob Erekson--who, by the way, just turned 80--is trying to keep up with the times. He has become a relatively sophisticated computer user. Last fall he and his brother, Gene, attended COMDEX–Las Vegas--one of the largest computer trade shows. They try to keep up with the latest and greatest computer stuff. My father is able to discuss computers with his grandchildren, many who work full-time in computing.<br><h2><b>The Source of Technology</b></h2><br>As we consider technology and theology, it is interesting that many of our Church leaders believe that technology has come as a direct result of inspiration from the Lord. In general conference in October 1926, Elder Joseph Fielding Smith stated the following:<br><br><i>I maintain that had there been no restoration of the gospel, and no organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there would have been no radio; there would have been no airplane, and there would not have been the wonderful discoveries in medicine, chemistry, electricity, and the many other things wherein the world has been benefited by such discoveries. Under such conditions these blessings would have been withheld, for they belong to the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times of which the restoration of the gospel and the organization of the Church constitute the central point, from which radiates the Spirit of the Lord throughout the world. The inspiration of the Lord has gone out and takes hold of the minds of men, though they know it not, and they are directed by the Lord. In this manner he brings them into his service that his purposes and his righteousness, in due time, may be supreme on the earth.</i><br><br><i>. . . I do not believe for one moment that these discoveries have come by chance, or that they have come because of superior intelligence possessed by men today over those who lived in ages that are past. They have come and are coming because the time is ripe, because the Lord has willed it, and because he has poured out his Spirit on all flesh.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1926, 117]<br><br>This statement was made at a general conference 75 years ago. As we contemplate the technological innovations since that time, we can see the Lord's hand in providing the technologies to further His work.<br><br>Early leaders of the Church embraced technology. For example, in 1861 President Brigham Young contracted to build the telegraph system from Nebraska to California. He also used this opportunity to build a telegraph line from southern Idaho to northern Arizona to connect members in the Intermountain West. Adopting this new technology also provided a means for the Church to communicate with the world.<br><br>Church leaders have always placed a premium on communication technologies. When I was a young deacon, I remember traveling with my father and grandfather to the stake center in Chicago each April and October to listen to the telephone wire transmission of the general priesthood meeting. Can you imagine being 12 years old, sitting on hard pews, and listening to a conference session over the PA system? What a joy it was when WGN-TV in Chicago decided to broadcast one hour of general conference on Sunday morning--of course the general priesthood session was still a sound-only telephone transmission.<br><br>When cable TV was emerging, our local community cable system carried a full session of general conference. Imagine, real time conference on TV! Or was it tape delayed? Before we knew it, stake centers had satellite dishes that enabled us to receive all conference sessions in real time, and without commercials! We could even get some BYU games via those satellite dishes! Now that was a real advancement. Today members worldwide have access to general conference via the Internet.<br><br>This is but one example of how the Church embraces new technologies. Other examples include the use of computers in family history research, in tracking and updating membership records, and in the general administration of the Church. My father, who currently serves as ward membership clerk, told me that in the late 1960s the Church had difficulty handling 3,000 membership record changes and updates per day--all done by hand. It could take up to four months for changes to be recorded and verified. Today he can submit membership record updates electronically on Sunday and have verification by Tuesday of the same week--and we are more than 11 million members and still growing!<br><h2><b>Doing</b></h2><br>Although our church has many unique beliefs, we are an action-oriented church--a church of doers, if you will. This aspect of our religion also shows the link between theology and technology, as doing is core to technology. Elder Hartman Rector, Jr., noted this: "The theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is such that you cannot be passive" ("The Roots of Mormonism,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1975, 56).<br><br>We can't be passive. We must be active. In effect, the Church purports a gospel of action, or doing. Membership requires action. It takes action to learn the gospel and the commandments. It takes action to keep the commandments and to live a Christlike life. To be a disciple of Christ, we have to receive the law and do it (see D&amp;amp;C 41:5).<br><br>In the New Testament, James noted that faith is difficult, if not impossible, to have without action and application. He stated that "faith without works is dead" (James 2:20). He further encouraged members to be "doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22).<br><br>We are members of a "doing" church. As I recall, President Kimball had a slogan on his desk that simply said, "Do it!" His watchwords to the Church were to "lengthen our stride." He also had the words changed in the chorus of the song "I Am a Child of God" from "Teach me all that I must<i>know"</i>to "Teach me all that I must<i>do</i>/ To live with him someday" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 301; emphasis added). It clearly takes more than knowledge to return to God after this life. It takes knowledge and thoughtful action.<br><br>We are a people of doers and hard workers. We even have hymns about work--for example, "Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 252). We should follow the example of the Savior, who did not stand idly by. He was active in learning--line upon line, precept upon precept. He was a carpenter and a teacher and a tireless worker. He applied His knowledge and experience in doing good.<br><br>President Hinckley noted that "nothing of real substance comes without work" (<i>Standing for Something</i>[New York: Times Books, 2000], 80). He further stated: "I believe in the gospel of work. Work is the miracle by which talent is brought to the surface and dreams become reality" (<i>Standing,</i>80).<br><br>Of course, doing and work require action and application. We won't accomplish much by just thinking about it. President Hinckley noted that "our pioneer forebears could never plow a field by turning it over in their minds" (<i>Standing,</i>80).<br><br>So, too, we must apply our knowledge. Of course knowledge can be applied for good or for evil--that two-way street I mentioned earlier. Leaders of the Church have encouraged us to use our knowledge and capabilities to build the kingdom. As students, you are preparing for your life's work--work in the home, in the Church, and in the professions.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball believed that technological development has come to further the work of the Lord. He stated:<br><br><i>I believe that the telephone and telegraph and other such conveniences were permitted by the Lord to be developed for the express purpose of building the kingdom. Others may use them for business, professional or other purposes, but basically they are to build the kingdom.</i>[Regional representatives seminar, 3 April 1975, 19; typescript copy, BYU Archives]<br><br>How will you apply the technological knowledge and experience you have gained in building the kingdom? Although each will have to answer this question for himself or herself, let me share some examples of BYU graduates who are applying their technological knowledge in building the kingdom.<br><br>Russ Mumford, a December 1999 construction management graduate, is the project engineer for the construction of the Nauvoo Temple. In this position he serves as second in command at the construction site. He is applying what he learned at BYU in literally building the kingdom and its temples.<br><br>Randy Bryson, a 1983 graduate of the electronics engineering technology program, is the director for the Church department that is responsible for the FamilySearch® Web site, one of the most heavily hit sites on the Internet. In this position he led the team that put together the Ellis Island project and loaded the information on the Internet. He works with stakes and wards in teaching people how to use the Internet for family history. Randy is applying his technological knowledge in the family history arena, helping members to do the research to redeem the dead.<br><br>Audrey Boone, a 1992 graduate of the technology teacher education program and a member of the Navajo nation, has been teaching at Monument Valley High School in Monument Valley, Utah, since graduation. In addition to teaching technology education, she has served as a seminary teacher. Audrey is applying her technological knowledge in teaching the rising generation.<br><br>Charles Harrell, a 1976 manufacturing technology graduate, has become an expert in computer-based simulation. He developed ProModel, a very powerful manufacturing simulation software package that is being used by the Church to plan and simulate in units such as the Family History Division, the Missionary Department, and the MTC. In the MTC, for example, ProModel is used to simulate traffic flow when missionaries are dropped off, and to simulate food service for the missionaries. Charley, now a BYU faculty member, is applying his technological knowledge in helping to strengthen the administration and operation of the Church.<br><br>Deborah Benson, who earned her master of science degree in 1993, initially worked for ProModel. She now works for Intermountain Health Care in the Engineering Management Division, where she uses simulation to improve hospital operations and reduce costs. She currently serves as a counselor in her stake Young Women presidency. She is applying her technological knowledge in her profession and she is providing leadership in the Church.<br><br>Darren Gardner graduated in facilities management in 1998. He works for the Church in the Planning Division of the Facility Management Department. As a facility planner he works with a team that analyzes where all new meetinghouses will be located and when they should be remodeled or expanded. He also speaks daily with stake presidents to assist them with their physical facility needs. Darren is applying his technological knowledge in strengthening stakes and wards with their meetinghouse needs.<br><br>Rhett Turner, a December 1999 construction management graduate, is a project superintendent for Fulton Homes in Tempe, Arizona. He is advancing rapidly in his chosen profession, and, like many BYU graduates, he is providing leadership in his local ward. Rhett was called as a counselor in the bishopric a short time after moving to Arizona. He is applying his technological knowledge in his profession and providing needed church service.<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>In summary, I believe that theology and technology are inseparably linked. Technology is, as I said earlier, knowing, thinking, and doing. Our theology is knowing and choosing the right and doing the right.<br><br>Theology provides a value structure for developing and deploying appropriate technologies. Technology provides the means for communicating the good news of the gospel and its theology to the inhabitants of the world and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Church.<br><br>In closing I would like to share with you part of the second verse of the hymn "Have I Done Any Good?":<br><br><i>There are chances for work all around just now,</i><br><i>Opportunities right in our way.</i><br><i>Do not let them pass by, saying "Sometime I'll try,"</i><br><i>But go and do something today.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 223]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, opportunities abound in our technological society, but we must do something about them. Make sure that you apply your education and experience in building the kingdom. Go and do something today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Thomas L. Erekson was director of the BYU School of Technology when this devotional address was given on 8 May 2001.</i><br><h2><b>Other Reading</b></h2><br>Rodney L.

<h1>ce: The Key to Eternal Progression - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago I was attending the baptismal service for my daughter Mary. As many of you may know, there are generally a few talks on the topic of baptism that are given at this service. On this particular day, the man assigned to give the talk decided to teach a short lesson to the baptismal candidates rather than give a traditional talk. So he had each eight-year-old child move to the front of the chapel and sit on the front bench as he gave the lesson. He started the lesson by asking the following question to the children: "After you're baptized, who is it that is there to guide you and comfort you and help you make good decisions?"<br><br>A little girl raised her hand and promptly answered: "It's the Holy Ghost."<br><br>Smiling, the teacher said, "That's right." The teacher then asked another question: "And after you are baptized, who is it that is bad and evil and wants you to be miserable for the rest of your life?"<br><br>A little boy raised his hand and blurted out: "I know who it is. It's the IRS!"<br><br>As my wife, Theresa, and I have tried to teach our seven children the principles of the gospel, we recognize that sometimes--as in the case of the young man in this story--our lessons haven't always been completely understood by our children. Those of us raised in the Church will have attended well over 2,000 meetings in which we have been taught the principles of the gospel before we reach the age of 18. Despite attending all of these meetings, I have found that most of us have difficulty understanding and applying even some of the basic principles of the gospel. That is why today I have decided to talk about the second principle of the gospel, that of repentance. I know many of you have heard talks and had lessons on this topic before, but I hope today we can gain some additional insight into this principle that will help us on our journey to salvation.<br><h2><b>Why My Interest in Repentance?</b></h2><br>One might wonder why I'm interested in this particular principle of the gospel. There are several reasons.<br><br>First, my professional life has been devoted to helping people, groups, and organizations change to become more effective. Although one might not call such changes repentance, I have learned much about how to initiate change in the secular world from what I have learned from the sacred. I have also gleaned ideas from my field regarding personal change that I have found helpful in the repentance process.<br><br>Second, my son Justin has been serving a mission in Recife, Brazil, for almost two years. His letters home describing the challenges, joys, and sorrows he has experienced as he has helped people in that part of the world repent and change their lives has encouraged me and my family to also try to change our lives to become better disciples of Christ.<br><br>Third, my patriarchal blessing explicitly warns me that the power of Satan will be strong in the latter days and that I will be tempted many times. My blessing encourages me to practice repentance all the days of my life. Evidently the Lord knew that I would make many mistakes. Thus I knew that for me to progress in this life I would need to understand and apply the principle of repentance. Fortunately the scriptures give me comfort, telling me that I'm not the only one who will need this principle, for the Apostle John wrote: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8).<br><br>Fourth, I developed a keen interest in the principle of repentance as I served as bishop of the BYU 127th Ward for four years. I worked with many bright, intelligent, and wholesome young people who, despite their upbringing in the Church, had made serious errors in their lives. Moreover, I found that many of them struggled to repent because they lacked a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of repentance.<br><br>For these reasons I would like to share some of what I have come to know on the subject of repentance so that you might be alerted to some of the snares that are often encountered in our attempts to repent.<br><h2><b>What Do We Need to Repent Of?</b></h2><br>The Savior tells us that no unclean thing can enter the kingdom of God (see 3 Nephi 27:19). And what makes us unclean? Breaking the commandments given to us by our Heavenly Father. President Spencer W. Kimball helps us to understand what those commandments are in his book<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(see pages 39 through 59). President Kimball outlined the following sins of commission that cause us to become unclean:<br><br>1. Idolatry, which he defined as worshiping the things of this world<br><br>2. Rebellion against the counsel of Church leaders<br><br>3. Being traitors, or those who strive to undermine the Church<br><br>4. Sabbath breaking<br><br>5. Loving money<br><br>6. Stealing<br><br>7. Being unholy masters, which he defined as treating employees unfairly<br><br>8. Improvidence, or failing to provide for one's family<br><br>9. Bearing false witness<br><br>10. Vulgarity<br><br>11. Violating the Word of Wisdom<br><br>12. Covenant breaking<br><br>13. Hating God<br><br>14. Ingratitude<br><br>15. Unmercifulness<br><br>16. Giving in to anger<br><br>17. Violating the law of chastity (President Kimball covered the law of chastity in two chapters in his book.)<br><br>Although these sins are what we call sins of commission--that is, they are based on particular actions--James wrote about what are called sins of omission. In James 4:17 he told us, "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." Furthermore, the Lord tells us in D&amp;amp;C 58:27 that we should be "anxiously engaged in a good cause" and use our free will to "bring to pass much righteousness." Thus we can also sin by merely doing nothing.<br><br>Why does our Father in Heaven give us all these commandments? Because He wants us to have joy in this life and in the world to come. He wants us to understand that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). However, He also knew that we, being imperfect creatures, would sin, and thus we would need a Savior to atone for our sins. Because our Father in Heaven "cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (D&amp;amp;C 1:31), we would all be lost without the principle of repentance and the Savior's Atonement, which makes us clean again and reconciles us to God.<br><br>Before continuing, I would like each of us to think about what sin or sins may be hindering our progress on the path to eternal life. Try to identify one or two things that you feel you need to either start doing or stop doing. Write them down if that would be helpful.<br><br>Now that you and I have some idea concerning what we need to work on, let us now focus on the steps we must follow to fully repent. From my days in Primary, I still remember what are called the four Rs of repentance. They are:<br><br>1. Recognition. We must recognize what we have done wrong.<br><br>2. Remorse. We must feel godly sorrow for our mistakes. This sorrow should lead us to confess our sins to those we have injured and, in serious cases, confess to our bishop.<br><br>3. Restitution. We must try to restore what has been lost as a result of our transgressions. This is why murder or violations of the law of chastity are difficult to repent of, since full restitution is difficult, if not impossible.<br><br>4. Resolve. We must resolve never to commit the sin again.<br><br>Although these steps might seem quite simple, actually following them is not that easy. I would like to describe six common mistakes that make it difficult for us to fully repent.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 1: Relying on friends or the media to help determine the difference between right and wrong.</i>Today there is much misinformation about what is right and wrong. If one watches television, movies, or other media, the message is that those who live clean and virtuous lives are out of step with the times; lying to gain advantage is what "smart" people do; and violence is an acceptable way to solve our problems. These views are no different from what Korihor, the anti-Christ, preached in Alma 30 when he argued that "every man prospered according to his genius, and ... every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime" (Alma 30:17). Because of such teachings, the Lord reminds us that there are those who will call evil good and good evil in the latter days. Moreover, our friends and associates may have adopted many of the views and ways of the world. They may influence us to rationalize our sinful behaviors by saying, "Everybody does it," and hence they are not reliable sources.<br><br>To recognize sin we must not rely on the world but rely on our living prophet, President Hinckley; the scriptures; and our ecclesiastical leaders to show us the way. And we also should rely on the Spirit. While counseling young people in my role as bishop, some of them expressed surprise that their conduct was considered sinful. However, I would ask them: "What did the Spirit tell you while you were doing those things?" Invariably they would answer that they felt uncomfortable and that they could feel that something was wrong. Thus we can also rely on the Holy Ghost to help us discern truth from error.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 2: Failing to confess properly.</i>Some people believe that they can change their lives by merely "working it out on their own." This is a serious mistake. Confession is important for four reasons.<br><br>First, the Lord requires that we confess. In D&amp;amp;C 58:43 we are told, "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them."<br><br>Second, confession provides individuals the opportunity to unburden themselves from sin, thus providing them with some catharsis.<br><br>Third, as we acknowledge our sins to those we've injured, we are motivated to move to the next stages of repentance by forsaking our sins and attempting to restore what has been lost as the result of our transgressions.<br><br>Fourth, by making our sins known to the proper people, those individuals can help us to change our lives.<br><br>One reason, I believe, that the Lord requires confession to the bishop in cases of serious sin is that the bishop can become part of the person's support system to change as the bishop objectively helps the person determine what is needed for repentance. All of the research on individual change indicates that a strong support system is necessary to achieve permanent change. We generally fail to repent when we try to change by ourselves or cover our sins in secrecy. I believe that is also why the Church encourages young people to share their problems, even their serious ones, with their parents. Although many of you may think, "I could never tell this to my bishop or my parents. They wouldn't understand," my own experience has shown that these fears are generally unfounded. Bishops and parents love you unconditionally. They want to help you. They've made mistakes, too, and will understand. Don't walk the path of repentance alone, if you truly want to change your life. Sometimes you might not know if you should confess a particular sin to a bishop. My rule of thumb is: When in doubt, visit with the bishop, for he will help you.<br><br>Others see confession as the only step in repentance. They believe if they merely confess to the bishop that they will be forgiven. What they fail to realize is that all of the steps in the repentance process are important. Furthermore, they fail to realize that it is the Lord who forgives, not the bishop. Although ecclesiastical leaders determine disciplinary action and serve as common judges in Israel, ultimately the Lord will determine whether we are worthy of His atoning sacrifice.<br><br>The example of Enos from the Book of Mormon is a good illustration of how we each must receive inspiration regarding our standing with the Lord. Enos prayed all day and into the night to finally get an answer as to whether he was forgiven.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 3: Feeling bad about being caught but not feeling godly sorrow for sin.</i>The remorse for sin that we must feel should be heartfelt in order to motivate us to change. Unfortunately, those who have fallen into sin over long periods of time often become, as it says in the scriptures, "past feeling" and have lost the Spirit. President Ezra Taft Benson described the importance of feeling remorse this way:<br><br><i>Godly sorrow is a gift of the Spirit. It is a deep realization that our actions have offended our Father and our God. It is the sharp and keen awareness that our behavior caused the Savior, He who knew no sin, even the greatest of all, to endure agony and suffering. Our sins caused Him to bleed at every pore. This very real mental and spiritual anguish is what the scriptures refer to as having "a broken heart and a contrite spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 20:37). Such a spirit is the absolute prerequisite for true repentance.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>72]<br><br>It is important to remember, however, that Satan's counterfeit of godly sorrow is discouragement and feelings of worthlessness. Satan would have you believe that there is no hope for you, so why resist? I found that many of my ward members would get so discouraged and feel so badly that they were impeded in their path to repentance. As a bishop I came to realize that good people make bad mistakes. That does not make them bad people. To repent we must feel godly sorrow and recognize our errors. But at the same time we should recognize that we are children of our Heavenly Father who are here on earth to succeed, not to fail. He loves us in spite of our shortcomings and will help us on our path to perfection.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 4: Restitution is not just saying you're sorry.</i>As I think back to the times when my children would fight with one another, Theresa and I would often try to make peace by requiring the children to tell each other they were sorry for what they had done. Unfortunately, a few minutes later they would often start fighting again, and again we would tell them to tell their brother or sister they were sorry. For some reason just saying "sorry" didn't seem to change their behavior very well. As I think about it now, a better solution would be to tell my children that they needed to not only say "I'm sorry" but to repair the harm they had done. For example, if they had taken one of their sibling's toys without asking, they might have to give their sibling one of their favorite toys to play with. If they had said something unkind, they might need to write a letter describing all the good qualities of the person they offended. By requiring such acts of restitution, they might think twice before fighting. Restitution is not easy. It requires thought and hard work.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 5: Believing only improvement is important.</i>Some people on the road to repentance feel that it is important to just continue to improve over time and that mistakes now and then are deemed acceptable by the Lord. Improvement is important, for President Benson has said: "Most repentance does not involve sensational or dramatic changes, but rather is a step by step, steady and consistent movement toward godliness" (<i>TETB,</i>71). However, at some point in time the Lord does expect us to completely forsake our sins and achieve perfection. He encourages us, "Be ye therefore perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Thus He would not be entirely pleased if we merely improved from paying only 2 percent of our income in tithing to paying 9 percent by the end of our lives. Nine percent is still not a full tithe. Similarly, a pattern of living the Word of Wisdom for several months and then falling back would not be considered true repentance. Moreover, when we repeat a sin after trying to repent, the Lord tells us that "the former sins return" (D&amp;amp;C 82:7). It is as though we didn't repent the first time. Thus, improvement is important and we should feel good about our progress, but perfection needs to be the goal.<br><br><i>Mistake Number 6: Not forgiving ourselves.</i>Although many of us are quite willing to forgive those who have transgressed against us, we often find it difficult to forgive ourselves. Satan would have us believe that the stains of sin are permanent. However, if the Lord is willing to forgive, we should forgive also, for the Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants: "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10). I believe that the phrase "all men" includes ourselves. Although we should be vigilant in not returning to our unrighteous ways, we should forgive ourselves, we should move on with our lives, and, as does the Lord, we should remember those sins no more.<br><h2><b>The Key to Repentance: A Change of Heart</b></h2><br>Following the four Rs of repentance can help us to change our behavior, but the Lord also wants us to experience a change in our hearts. When I was a new bishop on campus, I was told that bishops often help ward members avoid sin and repent by giving them various rules to follow. For example, if someone had a problem with the Word of Wisdom, the bishop might tell him to not frequent places where he had had this problem. If a sister was having problems with the law of chastity, she should be advised to set a curfew for herself. Unfortunately, in my experience, these rules didn't always help to change their behavior. As I thought about why the rules weren't working very well, it became clear to me that the individuals had not had a change of heart. If their hearts had been changed, their behavior would have changed as well. Mosiah described the process that the people listening to King Benjamin went through as they experienced a "mighty change in [their] hearts" (Alma 5:14):<br><br><i>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ.</i>[Mosiah 4:2–3]<br><br>Mosiah went on to say that because of this mighty change in the people's hearts, they had "no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2).<br><br>What a great blessing it would be to have no desire to do evil but to always want to do what is right! To repent, we must strive to achieve this change. It often takes much fasting and prayer so that we can truly change our hearts and overcome our sins.<br><br>Once we have changed our hearts and our actions, we then can be cleansed from our sins as we partake of the sacrament. If we have truly repented, our sins are washed away as we renew our baptismal covenant. Isaiah told us, "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow" (Isaiah 1:18). However, if we partake of the sacrament with no intention of repenting of our sins, the Apostle Paul tells us that we will be eating and drinking damnation to our souls (see 1 Corinthians 11:29). This does not mean we need to be perfect people to take the sacrament. If that were the case, there would be no need for the ordinance. But if we are striving to repent, we can then use the sacrament to aid us in the repentance process.<br><h2><b>The Blessings of Repentance</b></h2><br>In closing, I would like to briefly discuss the blessings of repentance. Previously I read a scripture from Mosiah that described the joy and peace of conscience that the people felt when they repented. Wouldn't we all like to feel the joy and peace of conscience that they felt? After he had repented, Alma the Younger marveled that his joy was as exceeding as was his pain, and there was "nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy" (Alma 36:21). Repentance also brings with it feelings of gratitude for our Savior, his atoning sacrifice, and the plan of salvation.<br><br>Some of these feelings of joy and gratitude connected with repentance are expressed in a letter one of my ward members sent to me several years ago. He wrote the following:<br><br><i>I feel much better about myself and my future. I've got a couple</i>[of]<i>low-paying job offers, and tomorrow I've got two more interviews. I'm going to take one so that I can have some money coming in. Thanks again for the blessing. It's very helpful and comforting to have one. It had been such a long time. I think I've finally got those problems licked. That is not to say I'm going to drop my guard, but I'm going to maintain it and my worthiness even more and at all costs. More than anything, I want to get back to the temple soon. Now that I've put those wrong behaviors behind me, I find myself desiring to follow our Heavenly Father's commandments to the utmost. I also feel grateful for being forgiven for my sins, and that makes me want to serve my Father in Heaven.</i><br><br>This letter describes a young man whose soul is now full of hope, where before it was filled only with despair.<br><br>Finally, repentance provides us with an opportunity to commune with the divine. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord tells us that "every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me ... , shall see my face and know that I am" (D&amp;amp;C 93:1). And the Lord gives the following promise to those who repent and keep his commandments: "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him" (John 14:23). What a wonderful promise! It is my prayer that we will use the great principle of repentance so that our Father's Spirit will abide with us always as we walk the path to eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W.

<h1>You This Day” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am deeply grateful for this opportunity and pray that the Holy Ghost will bless and enlighten all of us during the next 30 minutes. I pray that He will be with me that I might speak clearly and truthfully, and with you that you might hear with your ears and understand with your hearts.<br><br>Over the course of our lives we are required to make many decisions. Some of them are simple and straightforward, whereas others are more complex and in some cases may alter the course of our lives forever. During our earliest years, someone else, usually our parents or grandparents or siblings, either makes or helps us make all of our decisions. Yet as we grow and mature, more and more decisions are left to us.<br><br>Initially our decision-making responsibilities are relatively simple: Who shall I play with today? What clothes shall I wear? Shall I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a cheese sandwich for lunch? Although these decisions may seem somewhat challenging to young minds, usually there is no particular advantage or disadvantage of one decision over another. However, as we reach young adulthood, our choices become more and more important, and the implications and ramifications of each decision become more and more serious. We hope that at that critical juncture we are still open to the helpful insights and experiences of the mature adults in our lives--parents, grandparents, Church leaders, and teachers. So many times in our adolescence and early adult years our lives can be enriched and blessed if we are simply able to recognize our own lack of experience and wisely seek the advice and counsel of those who have our well-being and success first in their hearts.<br><br>At times, if we fail to make the right choices, we may find ourselves at least somewhat removed from that strait and narrow path that leads to eternal life. But fortunately that condition is not necessarily permanent. We need only repent and recover our standing with Christ and begin anew making the choices that will secure our souls in Him. In some cases we may forever lose some blessing or opportunity, but there are always future choices and wonderful blessings available to the repentant soul. Of his personal experience with repentance, the prophet Alma said:<br><br><i>For three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i><br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i>[Alma 36:16–20]<br><br>The Old Testament prophet Joshua labored faithfully among the children of Israel from their departure out of the land of Egypt until his death at the age of 110. He was consistently faithful and supportive of the prophet Moses, and of all the adults in Israel who left Egypt, only Joshua and Caleb were permitted to enter the promised land. To a new Israelite generation, whom he had nurtured and blessed as if he were their father, he gave this wise admonition:<br><br><i>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord,</i>choose you this day whom ye will serve;<i>whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell:</i>but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. [Joshua 24:14–15; emphasis added]<br><br>With a wisdom cultivated in 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, a new generation of Israelites, without reservation or hesitation, replied:<br><br><i>God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods;</i><br><br><i>For the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</i><br><br><i>And the Lord drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land:</i>therefore will we also serve the Lord; for he is our God. [Joshua 24:16–18; emphasis added]<br><br>Across time and space Joshua calls to modern Israel, to you and me: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve." To us, just as it did to the children of Israel in Joshua's time, comes the opportunity to declare that we will "also [choose to] serve the Lord; for he is our God."<br><br>For the balance of my time this morning I would like to share with you, in some detail, two personal experiences. One comes from my childhood and the other from my adult life. With each experience I found myself faced with a choice: in one case I made the wrong decision and the lesson came the hard way, whereas in the other I finally listened to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and was able to make the right decision. However, from each experience I learned a valuable, life-altering lesson. My purpose this morning is to try to bless your lives by sharing with you some of the lessons I have learned as I have made critical choices.<br><br>At first I thought I would share only experiences where I made the right decision, but none of us are perfect, and many of the important lessons of life are learned as we make mistakes and repent. Regardless, with every experience I have learned that the Lord's way, no matter how difficult or out of step with the rest of the world, is always the best way. Choosing Him and His ways has always brought the best blessings and opportunities into my life.<br><br>When I was six years old, my father, a career soldier, was assigned to the Southern NATO Command in Naples, Italy. We spent three marvelous years in that wonderful country. Prior to Christmas in 1958, my young friends and I determined that we all wanted BB guns for Christmas. I began discussing my request with my parents early in the fall, since many of our Christmas presents had to be purchased in the United States and sent by mail to Italy. My father sent the money for my BB gun to my Grandmother St. Clair well before Christmas, and yet the gun did not arrive until February of 1959. Despite regular encouragement from both myself and my father, my grandmother seemed reluctant to buy and send the gun to me. She repeatedly emphasized to us in her letters that she did not feel good about my having a BB gun at such a young age. As it turned out, my grandmother's concerns proved to be intuitive, perhaps even inspired.<br><br>When the gun finally arrived, my father took great care to teach me how to use it properly. He not only drilled me on various basic safety rules, but he repeatedly emphasized that I could not take the gun out of the house without his permission. I remember distinctly that my gun was the most powerful and best model that Daisy Manufacturing Company made, and my friends were both impressed and, at least in one case, somewhat jealous. One boy in our group of friends did not receive a BB gun that Christmas. In time this young man's jealousy, compounded by what I think was probably an abusive family situation, resulted in tragedy for me and in a very real sense for all of us.<br><br>My friends and I went on several "hunting" expeditions during the late winter and early spring of 1959, one of which I remember in particular. Very early one Saturday morning we went out to an open rocky area, not too far from where we lived, to hunt lizards. I recall that the lizards were far easier to shoot during the early morning hours when they were still somewhat lethargic. I vividly remember shooting my first lizard and for the first time feeling a clear sense of taking life from another living creature. It was a feeling I have never forgotten, and I remember from that time forward being content to shoot only at tin cans and other inanimate objects.<br><br>Toward the end of April 1959, on a Saturday, my parents went to Naples to pick up some friends. My brother and sister and I stayed with the maid. As the morning progressed, I became bored and decided that I would take the BB gun and shoot for a while from the flat roof of our apartment building. I clearly understood that this was against my father's rules, but I felt that I could "play with the edge" without getting caught. I also remember that the maid frantically pleaded with me not to take the gun, but even at the tender age of eight (almost nine), I was more concerned with what I wanted than with what the adults in my life knew was best for me. Little did I know that before that day came to a close, my life would be forever changed. Never again would I think or feel or see things the same way.<br><br>After shooting for a while, I invited one of my friends to come over. At some point I decided that I would have greater success if I climbed atop the small building covering the steps that exited from the main part of the building to the roof. After shooting from that vantage point for a while, I handed the gun down to my friend, who had remained on the main roof, and I jumped from the small building. When I asked for the gun back, he moved away from me, refusing to return it. Then spontaneously he raised my BB gun to his shoulder and shot me twice. I remember standing there as he pointed the gun at me, hardly able to believe what was happening. The first BB hit me in the body and the second BB struck me in the right eye. I fell to the roof, completely stunned by what had happened. My friend dropped the gun and ran away.<br><br>I have no idea how long I lay on the roof of that building. My recollection of it today is that it was not very long. I finally scrambled downstairs to our apartment, and when I encountered the maid, she immediately became hysterical. I went to the bathroom mirror in hopes of assessing the damage to my eye. The trauma had caused my eyelid to "freeze" shut. Later the doctors explained to me that this is a normal response to severe eye injury, though the eyelid itself was not damaged. I was frantic, to say the least, because as I pried my eyelid open, I realized that I could not see with my right eye.<br><br>At that point I think the maid took me downstairs to our friends who lived in the first-floor apartment. They immediately put me in their car and started for the hospital. On the way to the naval hospital in Naples, they stopped at a local Italian hospital. The doctor there made a cursory examination of my injured eye, simply bandaged the eye, and recommended that they rush me to the American hospital. Just before arriving at the naval hospital, we passed my parents on their way back from the morning's activities. To this day, one of my most painful memories from that nightmare is my mother's response as she climbed into the backseat of our neighbors' car with me. She immediately began to weep as she took me in her arms. Even after all these years, I grieve at the pained expression I can still see etched on her face.<br><br>My father followed us to the hospital in our car. When we arrived, they took me to the emergency room, where one of the doctors rinsed my injured eye with a sterile saline solution. I remember one of the doctors in the emergency room that day was a navy captain. My only question was: "They don't have one-eyed soldiers, do they?" I think in some small measure the magnitude of my mistake and the lifelong consequences of my choice had already become apparent to me. The balance of that day is a blur.<br><br>Fortunately, a young navy ophthalmologist, Dr. Woods, had been temporarily assigned to the hospital in Naples. Dr. Woods was summoned to the hospital, and after a thorough examination he determined that the retina had been severely and irreparably damaged. He gently recommended that the eye be removed immediately. The trauma of the injury, compounded by Dr. Woods' radical suggestion that my eye be removed, was more than my parents and I could assimilate. We pleaded for time to think and time to see if by some miracle the sight in my eye would be restored.<br><br>That night Dr. Woods, using a powerful electric magnet obtained from a nearby Italian hospital, removed the BB from my eye. Because I had a slight fever, the doctor determined that it would not be wise to use a general anesthetic; therefore, he numbed my face with several injections of Novocain. I distinctly remember Dr. Woods explaining that the BB had been lodged deep in the eye, very close to my brain. After the BB had been removed, the doctor bandaged both eyes, explaining to us that by covering both eyes, movement in the right eye could be restricted, thus promoting healing and recovery. Dr. Woods was immensely supportive and genuinely kind and gentle. I was immediately impressed by him and consistently felt confident in his skill as a physician.<br><br>I was in the hospital for two weeks. During that time one of my parents was always with me, day and night. Several times each week Dr. Woods and the medical staff would come into my room, remove the bandages, and use a small penlight to see if there was any light perception in my right eye. Each time the result was the same: "No response."<br><br>Mom and Dad read to me continually while I was in the hospital. I remember that I would lie there and listen to one Hardy Boys book after another. I must have been kept somewhat sedated, because I would often drift off to sleep and then suddenly wake up, realizing that I had lost track of the story line. Because both of my eyes were bandaged, my parents found it difficult to determine whether or not I was asleep.<br><br>One particular night when my father was staying with me, I remember waking up and hearing him as he wept, saying over and over again, "This is all my fault. Why did I ever buy that BB gun? What have I done?" For the second time the tragic impact of my poor choice on the lives of my innocent parents sank deep into my heart, and I wished more than anything that I could lift the burden of grief and responsibility from their shoulders. As I lay in that hospital bed, I felt a strong resolve begin to grow in my soul that never again would I cause my parents to suffer for my mistakes.<br><br>At some point during the two weeks I spent in the hospital, Dr. Woods came to my parents and again explained to them that my chances of recovery were essentially zero. I think we were all still hoping against hope that somehow things would change. But each time the doctor checked my injured eye, it was clearer and clearer to me that there was no change. I never said anything to anyone, but the dread of being blind in one eye weighed heavily on my mind. As much as I wanted the situation to be different, I knew that I had been permanently blinded at the moment the BB entered my eye.<br><br>Eventually I returned to school again, with a patch covering my injured eye. I remember several times praying fervently that somehow the Lord would heal my eye and allow me to see again. Fortunately the Lord knew and understood so much more than I did. His perspective was eternal, and mine was limited only to what seemed most important to my young heart. There was not to be any miraculous restoration of my sight; rather, another much more profound miracle was to begin--one that would unfold over a lifetime, one that would bless and enrich my life in ways that I could never understand at that point in my life. As always, the God who knew and loved me best did what was best for me in the end.<br><br>That beautiful spring day in April 1959 has become a benchmark day in my life, a day that has shaped and molded so much of what I have become over the course of my life. To this day, more than 40 years later, I vividly remember what happened, and, in spite of the pain and disappointment that at times have washed over me because of the choices and consequences of that day, I can honestly say that God in His infinite wisdom has been able to bless and enrich my life because of that experience. At this point in my life I regret only my disobedience and the pain and grief inflicted on my good parents because of my bad choice. However, I would not trade out of my life the lessons, insights, vision, and compassion that have come to me as I have dealt with my handicap. My soul is more committed to virtue, my heart is more dedicated to truth, and my own life is more filled with mercy and charity because of what happened to me in the spring of 1959.<br><br>Ten years later, in the spring of 1969, I received a call to serve a full-time mission for the Church in the Japan Okinawa Mission. Most of my friends would have been delighted with a call to such a mysterious and exotic place, but not me. I was stunned, and inside I was deeply disappointed. In high school I had concluded that I had absolutely no foreign language skills. I had studied Spanish for two years with little or no success. I decided that I would be delighted to serve a mission as long as I did not have to learn a foreign language. A call to Japan for me seemed devoid of inspiration. I was heartsick!<br><br>However, over the six weeks before I entered the Mission Home in Salt Lake City, I tried hard to adjust my feelings and prepare for a mission to Japan. But in all honesty, as I entered the Mission Home on June 14, I was still a reluctant servant. Three days later I left Salt Lake City with a group of new missionaries and traveled to Laie, Hawaii, to study Japanese for two months at what was then called the Church College of Hawaii. From the moment I exited the airplane in Honolulu, I was homesick and deeply discouraged by what seemed to be an absolutely impossible task.<br><br>That first evening each of us missionaries was handed an 81-page booklet containing the six missionary discussions in Japanese. We were informed that our task over the next two months was to memorize all six discussions. What our teachers failed to tell us was that so far no one had been able to accomplish the task. Nonetheless, it was perfectly clear to me that it was impossible. I struggled along on the verge of tears most of the time. I wanted so badly to go into the mission president's office and have him tell me that a terrible mistake had been made and that I had been reassigned to the Hawaii English-speaking mission. But there was no such luck. From morning to evening I struggled, becoming more and more discouraged with the passing of each day. The only thing that kept me from giving up and going home was the thought that my parents would be bitterly disappointed if I quit.<br><br>One Saturday, our preparation day in the Language Training Mission, I was reading my scriptures. I had just started the New Testament and was reading in the book of Matthew. I had read several chapters that morning and then suddenly realized that the mail had probably arrived. Since mail from family and friends was the one thing that seemed to lift my spirits, I decided to walk down to the mission office and see if anything had come for me. I was delighted to discover that I had a letter from home! As I looked at the envelope more closely, I was immediately alarmed. The letter was from my father. My father never wrote to me, and a letter from him invariably meant that something was wrong. With dread building in my soul, I took the letter back to my cubicle, opened it, and read it.<br><br>Just as I had suspected, the news was not good. My father, ever so briefly, explained that my mother was quite sick and had been taken to the hospital for surgery. He indicated that the prognosis was not good but that he would let me know more as soon as he was able to discuss the situation with the doctors. As I recall now, he didn't even tell me in the most general way what my mother's problem was.<br><br>My father had been assigned to Germany in December of the previous year, and I had not seen my family in more than six months. I had no idea how to place a phone call, and certainly my father had no idea how to contact me by phone. I would have to wait for his next letter. I was truly overwhelmed. I remember kneeling by my bed to pray. At first no words would come out of my mouth. I felt betrayed and abandoned. Then the words came slowly. With a measure of pain and disappointment, I reminded the Lord that I was trying to be His missionary and that the whole mission proposition had not been easy at all. I was frustrated and discouraged before, but now with the uncertainty of my mother's situation I was angry and devastated. It all seemed so unfair and unreasonable that I could have made such an incredible commitment to Him and now He was failing me. Between my tears I told the Lord that I was very unhappy with the way He was handling the whole situation. I also told Him that I had had all I could bear and that I was fully ready to call it quits and go home. I don't remember how long I went on, but I finally wiped away the tears and laid down on my bed.<br><br>Eventually I picked up my Bible again and began reading. In some miraculous fashion, just before I went to check the mail, I had finished reading Matthew 9. So when I resumed my reading, I started with chapter 10. In short order I reached verse 37, where I read these words:<br><br><i>He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</i><br><br><i>And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</i><br><br><i>He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</i>[Matthew 10:37–39]<br><br>In the words of Joseph Smith, "Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine" (Joseph Smith--History 1:12). I was completely stunned. I knew, beyond any capacity on my part to doubt, that the ancient Apostle Matthew had recorded those words so that a young, struggling, latter-day missionary would finally be able to get his soul in order. Every ounce of my self-pity and personal uncertainty was swallowed up in the absolute knowledge that I had to make a choice, and that choice might very well be between my mother and my Savior.<br><br>I teetered only for a brief moment and then fell weeping back onto my knees. I pleaded for forgiveness. I had accepted His invitation to serve but had held back most of my heart. I knew then that anything less than my whole soul, fully committed to Him and His work, was not good enough. With a resolve that I had never experienced before, I promised Him that I would be different than I had been, that I would give everything that He required, even whatever mortal time I had left with my mother.<br><br>Instantly my grief and disappointment were gone. There was no longer any heaviness or uncertainty in my heart. In an instant I had committed all I had, and He had in return cleansed my soul of every burden and filled my heart with a sublime peace. I was His, and without any reservation I knew He was my Savior and Master. I had finally "put [my] hand to the plough" (Luke 9:62), and never once since that day have I looked back!<br><br>I am grateful to say that my mother is still alive today, and I have been richly blessed with a long and meaningful relationship with this beautiful and wise woman. But I am here today to tell you, if she had died in 1969, it would not have changed my commitment to Christ. Just as I found out that summer day in 1969, I still know today that He is first and foremost in my life, He is my Savior and Master, and He has never forgotten me!<br><br>Choosing the Lord is both a daily and a lifelong task. In mortality we simply never arrive. We must diligently endure to the end every day. But I want you to know that with every choice you make in favor of Christ will come some blessing, some insight, some gift that will enrich and ennoble your life--not at all in a worldly way but rather in those beautiful, simple, and profoundly spiritual ways that secure our souls with the promise of eternal life.<br><br>Often in my prayers, both in private and with my family, I plead with the Lord to bless my children that they might see clearly and choose wisely. Today I extend that prayer to each of you that you, too, might be able to see clearly and choose wisely. I can think of no better blessing as you strive to successfully navigate the complex and uncertain waters of mortality. In all your choosing, please remember these simple but important lessons: consistent obedience to eternal law will always bless your life; poor choices will always bring grief and pain to the people that love you best; and, finally, we can never measure our relationship with Christ in degrees. His great gift requires our whole heart and soul. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry L.

<h1> in an Eternal Context - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and humbled by the opportunity to speak to you today. I want to discuss some features of the most prominent activity on campus--at least it should be the most prominent--that of learning. Learning has been important to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the beginning of the Restoration. There have been instructions about learning that have become part of our scriptures. The scriptures even tell us what kinds of things we can expect to learn and ought to learn, and give some indications of why we should learn. I would like to place the activity of learning in an eternal context, where learning gains value and appropriate attitudes about learning are fostered. With an eternal perspective, we can better fulfill our earthly missions.<br><h2><b>The Flood of Information</b></h2><br>First, let me remark, as did Elder Dallin H. Oaks in our last general conference, that we are inundated in these times with a flood of information. There are more sources of information now than ever before, and they are more easily accessed than ever before. Our challenge is not in finding information but in deciding to which information to give our attention. Without something to guide our choices, we could spend all our time perusing information without ever gaining any worthwhile knowledge. Without purpose to our learning, we could spend all our time acquiring knowledge and never learn what is important or how to use it. As Elder Oaks said in paraphrasing T. S. Eliot's poem<i>The Rock,</i>"'Wisdom' is 'lost in knowledge' and 'knowledge' is 'lost in information'" (Dallin H. Oaks, "Focus and Priorities,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 82–83; see also T. S. Eliot,<i>The Rock</i>[1934], I).<br><br>By the time adulthood is reached, every person has discovered that there is not enough time to do everything that he or she might be able to do. Similarly, it is now the case that there is not enough time to know everything that one might be able to know. Just as we must decide what to do, we must decide what to know. Our society has not fully discovered that principle and is still trying to handle all the information available without deciding which information to ignore. In many ways, our society is "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7).<br><h2><b>Knowledge of Greatest Worth</b></h2><br>The fact that some information is more important than other information is one of the basic principles taught by the gospel of Jesus Christ. We read in Moses 6 that Adam himself was instructed by the Lord what to teach his children. It is recorded that he was commanded to teach his children the plan of salvation: the gospel of Jesus Christ, the principle of repentance, and the ordinances of baptism by water and by the Spirit. The knowledge of the plan of salvation, we attest, is the most important information that can be known. Why is it the most important? Because without it, says the scripture, "they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God" (Moses 6:57).<br><br>We would classify the plan of salvation as spiritual knowledge, revealed to us by God. By contrast, we can learn many things on our own, outside of revelation per se, which we might classify as secular knowledge. A modern commandment to learn by teaching one another is found in the Doctrine and Covenants. The commandment is placed in the context of preparing to serve in the kingdom of God. It also clearly links spiritual and secular knowledge. We read:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:77–80]<br><br>I think this scripture is telling us that learning will help us carry out our earthly missions and that we ought to learn diligently in those studies where the grace of God can attend us. This scripture clearly places value on many secular subjects as being worthwhile to study as we prepare to build the kingdom. Some tend to think that whatever subject they wish to study is justified by this scripture. I would urge caution, though, for I think there are subjects in which the Spirit of God will not attend us. Clearly, some studies and choices of occupation better enable us to serve our families and the Church than others.<br><br>Once we realize that some information is more important than other information, and that there is more information available to us than we can learn, then it should not be hard for us to decide that we ought to spend our time learning the most important and valuable things. Whatever we learn should lift us, strengthen us, and enable us better to do the work we have to do in this life. Life is too short, as is often said, to spend our time learning trivial or degrading things when there is so much that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><h2><b>Learning by Faith</b></h2><br>Another scripture often quoted has to do with learning by faith:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>Most of us know what learning by study is, but seeking learning also by faith may not be as clear to us. Remember that to us, "faith" means "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" (Articles of Faith 1:4).<br><br>Here is a scripture that talks about the kinds of things we might expect to learn and also links learning to the power of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph wrote:<br><br><i>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now;...</i><br><br><i>A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld....</i><br><br><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ;</i><br><br><i>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars--</i><br><br><i>All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, ... and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times. ...</i><br><br><i>How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:26, 28–31, 33]<br><br>Exciting, isn't it? Especially the part about knowledge "pouring down ... from heaven" on our heads. It reminds me of the student's dream of having knowledge poured into his head without effort on his part, but I'm sure that's<i>not</i>what it means. I think it may also give us some insight about learning under the influence of the Holy Ghost; for one thing, we must have the Holy Ghost with us if it is going to work. We qualify for the companionship of the Holy Ghost when our lives are in order and when we seek it in prayer.<br><br>This reminds me of an old<i>Peanuts</i>comic strip. Linus has just received his history test back, and he says, "I'm afraid to look at it. Oh, I hope I got a good grade. Please, please, please, let it be a good grade."<br><br>Charlie Brown says to him, "You should have done all that hoping and praying when you were studying for the test."<br><br>Linus replies, with a look of disdain, "Hoping and praying should never be confused with studying."<br><br>Charles Schultz was right in having Linus say that hoping and praying are no substitute for studying. On the other hand, just as we are urged to pray for the companionship of the Spirit as we study the revealed word, so we should also desire the Spirit to help us as we study secular subjects, for the Spirit can enlighten us, help us understand, quicken our memories, and enable us to distinguish truth and error.<br><h2><b>Reasoning</b></h2><br>In several places in the scriptures, the Lord says, "Come, let us reason together." He even gives the reason for reasoning in the following passage:<br><br><i>And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit, unto the elders of his church, and let us reason together, that ye may understand;</i><br><br><i>Let us reason even as a man reasoneth one with another face to face.</i><br><br><i>Now, when a man reasoneth he is understood of man, because he reasoneth as a man; even so will I, the Lord, reason with you that you may understand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:10–12; see also Isaiah 1:18]<br><br>The Lord thus places value on reasoning as a means of understanding.<br><br>Let me note in passing that our experiences with students in mathematics courses tell us that our society does not place much value on reasoning. Many of the major forces in our society don't want you to reason. They would like you to just do as you are requested without thinking about it. Think of advertising, politics, and special interest groups of all sorts. Further, society doesn't give us much practice in reasoning as we are growing up. Even in school the emphasis seems too often to be on memorizing and regurgitating rather than on reasoning, and outside of school we spend a lot of time in passive entertainment. To live without reasoning sounds to me more like Lucifer's plan than the plan of happiness.<br><br>The Lord gives further light on the relationship of reason and faith in His interaction with Oliver Cowdery and his attempt to translate. Oliver was told that it was not enough just to ask, even in faith, but "you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). I think this pattern can apply to everything we study: we should do our best to reason it out and then ask the Lord to give us insight by the Spirit. I conclude from what the scriptures say that we are expected to use both reason and faith as we learn.<br><br>From what I have observed, Latter-day Saints contrast with many Christians in believing that reason even applies in understanding theological ideas. So much in classical Christianity is labeled as unexplainable mystery that many believers never try to reason things out.<br><h2><b>Conflict Between Knowledge and Belief</b></h2><br>As we study the gospel and secular subjects, we are going to come to ideas that contradict each other. I remember the rather shocking realization that something I was reading in a textbook couldn't be true. Books were given high regard in the home in which I was raised. From our earliest days my mother read to us--from the scriptures, library books, and stories serialized in the farming magazine. We grew up with a firm foundation in the gospel and with a love of reading and of learning in general. I had come to accept as valid what I read in books that were supposed to be telling the truth. Now here was something being stated as a fact that could not be true if my beliefs were correct.<br><br>I am sure this has happened to all of us. We gain knowledge from various sources and discover things that are supposed to be true that contradict each other. To reconcile such conflicts, we try to reason it out and we seek the light of the Spirit. We usually cannot reconcile these ideas until we gain more knowledge: either of our beliefs or of the subject under consideration. Sometimes the process takes years. In fact, many of us have conflicting notions in the recesses of our minds that are still unresolved, but we have faith that someday we will understand.<br><br>I don't remember the purported facts that first forced me to reconcile what I was learning with what I believed, but let me give you an example from a course I recently taught on campus. The course was History of Mathematics, and we were studying from one of the best books on the subject that is available today. This author is trying to be quite careful not to speculate on the early history of mathematics--for which there is no record and little evidence--but let me quote a paragraph from his first page:<br><br><i>It is commonly accepted that mathematics originated with the practical problems of counting and recording numbers. The birth of the idea of number is so hidden behind the veil of countless ages that it is tantalizing to speculate on the remaining evidences of early humans' sense of number. Our remote ancestors of some 20,000 years ago--who were quite as clever as we are--must have felt the need to enumerate their livestock, tally objects for barter, or mark the passage of days. But the evolution of counting, with its spoken number words and written number symbols, was gradual and does not allow any determination of precise dates for its stages.</i>[David M. Burton,<i>The History of Mathematics: An Introduction,</i>4th ed. (Boston: WCB McGraw-Hill, 1999), 1]<br><br>There are a couple of ideas in this paragraph that cause me some conflict. First, it is clear in the rest of the textbook that the author is going to be talking mainly about recorded history; that is, he is going to tell us something about the intellectual history of the race of Adam. But the race of Adam is only about 6,000 years old, according to scriptural history, so either that reference to 20,000 years ago is wrong or he is not talking about the race of Adam. This difficulty is of the same sort as numerous questions that arise--especially in anthropological studies--as to the dating of what appear to be human artifacts. Many of these kinds of questions are still unsettled.<br><br>Second, the reference to the gradual development of counting causes me some consternation. We know from scriptural history that the Adamic language was well developed rather than primitive. We read in the book of Moses:<br><br><i>And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration;</i><br><br><i>And by them their children were taught to read and write, having a language which was pure and undefiled.</i>[Moses 6:5–6]<br><br>Reading now parts of the next few verses, we find:<br><br><i>And a genealogy was kept of the children of God. And this was the book of the generations of Adam, saying: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him....</i><br><br><i>And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his own image, and called his name Seth.</i><br><br><i>And the days of Adam, after he had begotten Seth, were eight hundred years, and he begat many sons and daughters;</i><br><br><i>And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.</i>[Moses 6:8–12]<br><br>The next nine verses then go on to tell the birth dates and life spans of the patriarchs, all the way down to Enoch. From this I conclude that the language of Adam certainly included words for numbers, as well as the ability to count. Moreover, Enoch, in conversation with the Lord, talked about counting and mentioned a rather large number: "And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations" (Moses 7:30). That is, the race of Adam not only knew how to count, but they could discuss counting in the abstract. The upshot of all this, of course, is that the ability of Adam and his posterity to count and to speak and write numbers was fully developed from the beginning. The author's assertion that number ability developed gradually turns out to be speculation. On the other hand, we should not fault this author for making a statement that is in harmony with the currently accepted worldview; we just have to remember to reason out such statements for ourselves.<br><h2><b>Science and Religion</b></h2><br>We used to hear a lot about the conflict between science and religion. We seem to hear less about it in recent years, probably because so few in the world care to discuss religion in public. Let me explain just a little about the terms I am going to be using here. First of all, the scientific method is study that relies on observation--not on authority or on doctrine or on other preconceived ideas. That may be a slight oversimplification, but it will do for our purposes here. By "observation," I mean the use of the senses, often enhanced by instruments of various sorts, to determine what is happening. To describe what is happening, quantification and the language of mathematics is usually used. By "authority," I mean accepting something because someone says it is true. I do not mean that it is improper to accept someone's statement on faith, but it is an act of faith rather than of scientific observation. By "doctrine," I mean revealed knowledge, which does not come just by observation.<br><br>The primary aim of science is to construct explanations--called theories--of how things work and why they work that way. After numerous observations of a natural phenomenon, a theory is constructed that attempts to explain the phenomenon. If some subsequent observation does not conform to the theory, then the theory is modified to accommodate the observation. An observation that does conform to the theory does not prove the theory but merely fails to disprove it. Scientific theories cannot be proved, for to do so would require every possible observation to be made and noted to conform to the theory, and that is clearly impossible. Until some observation contradicts the theory, the theory is accepted as a plausible explanation.<br><br>Be on guard, then, when someone teaches a scientific theory as fact. Particularly be on guard when they treat any portion of science in a doctrinaire manner. Be equally on guard when someone allows no scientific evidence whatever to be presented; we regard such people as closed-minded or incapable of reason. So what about scientific theory and revealed knowledge that contradict each other? We have to continue to make observations and continue to study the revealed word and have faith that we will eventually make sense of the situation. After all, we do believe in absolute truth, which means that there is a way that things are; we just do not yet understand how all things are. It is in this context, particularly, that the assistance of the Holy Ghost is valuable; it can help us see how to understand the situation and can alert us to error.<br><br>When you consider science more carefully, the stance of science is that we<i>can</i>observe the world around us and learn something about it. The underlying premise is that there is order in the universe and that we can discover something about that order by observation. This has not been proven, though, but is accepted on faith. Stated more succinctly, scientific inquiry is really an act of faith. By extension, then, it is an act of faith anytime we undertake to learn something, for we first believe that there is some order to the question involved and that we<i>can</i>learn something about it.<br><h2><b>Attitude Toward Secular Knowledge</b></h2><br>Putting learning in an eternal context can help us form helpful attitudes about learning in general. For example, the history of this earth is an area in which there are still many questions unanswered. Geologists have constructed a theory by reading the evidence in the earth itself, but the theory still does not explain everything.<br><br>We know that we were all present when the Lord announced that an earth would be built on which we might dwell for the furtherance of our individual progression (see Abraham 3:24–26). We therefore undoubtedly watched with interest while the earth was being prepared for the race of Adam. Some, including President Joseph Fielding Smith, believe that we might have had a part in that preparation (see Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56], 1:74–75). It is probably the case, then, that we knew before we came to this earth far more about the earth's history than we will ever discover while here in mortality. The veil of mortality has blocked it from our memory, but there will come a point in our progression at which we will remember the things we knew from our experiences in pre-earth life. I suspect that not only in the matter of the earth's history but in many areas of secular learning, we have forgotten more in coming here than we will ever be able to learn while in mortality.<br><br>"Well, then," says the weary student, "if I'm going to remember it all at some point, why knock myself out now trying to learn it?" Beside the immediate application value of knowledge, Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>So if I study geology and learn all I can, then according to this scripture I will have an advantage in the next world as compared to someone who does not study geology. How can that be if we both eventually remember all we saw in our pre-earth life?<br><br>The only conclusion I can reach is that it must not be entirely the knowledge itself that gives us the advantage. I think it is the "diligence and obedience" that does so. If we practice learning while in this life, using self-discipline to be diligent and obedient, then we learn techniques of study, gain strength of character, and will have an increased ability to learn in the next life. These things, not just the knowledge itself, give us the advantage in the world to come.<br><br>I therefore believe that, in matters of secular learning,<i>more important than what we learn is what we go through to learn it.</i>The effort of learning gives us far more than just the knowledge we sought.<br><br>This should also be a comfort to many who labor diligently to learn the principles of, say, science and technology, only to have those ideas become obsolete in a short time. We can look back through the history of science and see how incomplete and inaccurate the theories of our forefathers were as compared to our own enlightened understanding. If you live long enough, you will see that our current understanding is also incomplete. That's just the way it is with most secular knowledge. But remembering that what we went through to learn it was also valuable, we don't have to feel that we wasted our time in learning it.<br><br>More particularly, this attitude gives us faith to study secular subjects, knowing that even if the subject changes, we will have gained much by our study. It also gives us patience as we try to reconcile what we are learning with what we believe, because the study required to do so also benefits us in other ways.<br><h2><b>Purpose of a University Education</b></h2><br>So why are we studying at a university, where much of our aim is to master the learning of the world? Remember that much of what we learn about secular things turns out not to be entirely accurate before long. Sometimes what you need to know and what you have worked so hard to master hardly lasts long enough to get you that first job. An acquaintance of mine who operates a private employment service says that, according to their statistics, a person can expect to have at least four different careers and 11 different jobs in a normal working lifetime. If a major aim of education is to prepare you for a job, how can it happen if the job you will have in 10 years does not yet exist?<br><br>I think the major role of a formal education is actually to teach us how to learn. This can be broken into several parts, including<br><br>1. to teach us how to communicate,<br><br>2. to teach us the skills of learning,<br><br>3. to inform us about how much there is to know, and<br><br>4. to give us the desire to learn.<br><br>First, at the university we refine the skills of oral and written communication, of qualitative and quantitative description, of reasoning, and of making understanding achievable.<br><br>Second, we gain practical skills in discovering worthwhile sources of information, gathering information, organizing knowledge into manageable structures, and preparing to use the knowledge we gain. We strengthen our resolve, our diligence, and our obedience by going through what must be done to gain knowledge. We learn self-discipline, which enables us to do whatever life asks of us.<br><br>Third, the university effectively teaches us how much there is to know by requiring us to sample widely in a general education program. Will Durant said, "Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance" ("Teachers: The Essence of the Centuries," Education,<i>Time,</i>13 August 1965, 48). We don't know how much we don't know until we know something. As former BYU academic vice president Eliot Butler once said:<br><br><i>For example, one who has never heard of ancient Greek civilization can have no concept of the extent of his ignorance of that subject. One who knows nothing of calculus cannot begin to appreciate how ignorant he is of the possibilities of reasoning, order, logic, and complex problem-solving offered by that area of mathematics.</i>[Eliot Butler, "Everybody Is Ignorant, Only on Different Subjects,"<i>BYU Studies</i>17, no. 3 (spring 1977): 281]<br><br>It is only as we come to know a little that we glimpse the vast extent of what we may yet learn.<br><br>Recognition of our relative ignorance also serves to keep us humble. Remember Jacob's lament: "O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned, they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God" (2 Nephi 9:28). It is this foolishness that leads to so-called intellectual apostasy. Recognizing how little we really know keeps us relying on the Lord.<br><br>Fourth, the desire to learn comes from several sources. The general education program whets our appetites for learning by showing us what may be learned. Teacher-scholars who are excited about their fields of study catch us up in the excitement of their learning when they share their knowledge and enthusiasm with us. As we continue to study the revealed word and learn the purposes of this life, we come to value learning for its own sake--that is, for the knowledge and experience it gives us--as well as for use in building the kingdom of God.<br><br>We are greatly blessed here at BYU to be able to learn in an eternal context. The knowledge of most worth comes first as we learn to place all learning in the context of the gospel of Jesus Christ and seek the gifts of the Spirit as we learn. An appropriate attitude about secular knowledge enables us to learn with diligence and obedience whatever interests us, in harmony with our mortal missions. As we study, we continually seek ways to reconcile secular and revealed knowledge, realizing that we may never learn enough in this life, even with the help of the Spirit, to be able to understand it fully. Even if our secular knowledge turns out to be inaccurate as time goes on, the faith, diligence, and obedience we exerted in learning it still gave us valuable experiences and strengthened us for the work we have to do.<br><br>May we ever be grateful to a loving Father in Heaven for having given us the capacity and opportunity to learn, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lynn E.

<h1>lity of Gospel Principles - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to be with you at Brigham Young University today. I am grateful for this opportunity. As I return to this campus, the wonderful and far-reaching influence of BYU on our family fills my mind. That influence began before I was born when a young woman from Monroe, Utah, Exilda Nielson, enrolled at Brigham Young University and graduated in the class of 1932. She would later be the mother of my sweetheart, Bonnie, who attended BYU for one year. Bonnie was ready to begin her sophomore year when I asked her to marry me, and she willingly sacrificed further formal education so that I could begin my college studies that year. In fact, she paid the tuition for my second term! She has not returned to these hallowed halls as a student, but she has nurtured the whole of her family here.<br><br>She bore two beautiful children while I completed my bachelor's degree in elementary education. She endured the next four years while I taught school in California and completed a master's degree at San Francisco State College. During that time period we were blessed with two more wonderful children.<br><br>Over the next three years she supported me with love and encouragement while I completed work for a doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Southern California. After completion of my doctorate and 13 years of university studies, I accepted a full-time teaching position in the College of Education here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>For me and my family, it was an honor and a privilege to associate for six years with the faculty and students of this great institution. I left BYU when I was called into full-time Church service.<br><br>Since that time all of our six children have attended BYU and have graduated with degrees in humanities, interior design, business, English, and education. Our son and his wife and a son-in-law have law degrees from BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School. Two sons-in-law have master's degrees from the Marriott School of Management. Our youngest daughter, Amy, graduated this past April with a degree in humanities. Next semester our oldest granddaughter will begin her first semester here--and thus our family's fourth generation--at this great university. You can see that Brigham Young University has had and will continue to have a marked influence for good in our family.<br><br>My heart is filled with gratitude to the Lord for all that His gospel and His church have brought into my life and the life of my family. I am grateful that under the inspiration of heaven, Brigham Young caused that this institution should be established. With gospel truths serving as the foundation for all learning and teaching at Brigham Young University, how great is the advantage to those who teach and study here.<br><br>On the first day of this month we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Brigham Young--prophet and president of the Church for 30 years. Last week, in a celebration held in Brigham Young's honor in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, President Gordon B. Hinckley paid tribute to him as "the greatest entrepreneur this country has produced." He said, "No one of whom I know was engaged in such a wide variety of undertakings."<br><br>In a video about Brigham Young, Utah historian Dean May stated that there is no "parallel to Brigham Young in the history of the settlement of the American West" (see "Brigham's Profound Faith,"<i>Church News,</i>9 June 2001, 16).<br><br>Harold J. Sheptstone, an English historian, wrote of Brigham Young:<br><br><i>Brigham Young dug canals, imported plants, and animals, built railways and telegraphs; established industries and banks, constructed theatres and universities; and encouraged literature, music, and art. . . . He planned and erected temples and tabernacles, still used by his people today; they are the wonder of modern architects. He was the founder of a hundred cities and settlements and the Governor of one of the territories of the United States.</i>[In Emerson Roy West,<i>Profiles of the Presidents</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 80]<br><br>President Hinckley pointed out that "while all of this was going on, he never lost sight of his greater mission. He was prophet, seer, and revelator to his people."<br><br>Today it seems appropriate to say a few words about Brigham Young the educator. Here was a man who received only 11 days of formal education (see<i>The Presidents of the Church,</i>ed. Leonard Arrington [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986], 44), yet became a leader of education and the founder of two great universities: Brigham Young University and the University of Utah.<br><br>He often spoke about the importance of education. In a conference of the Church in 1859, he said these words: "This is our labour, our business, and our calling--to grow in grace and in knowledge from day to day and from year to year" (<i>JD</i>6:268). He urged the people to promote schools and to study and counseled school teachers to "introduce every kind of useful studies into our schools" (<i>JD</i>12:32, misnumbered as page 407).<br><br>Brigham Young believed that a sound, practical education was a necessary requirement for preparation not only for one's life's work but also for service to the Lord. He said every minute of every day of our lives we should strive to improve our minds. He established a school in his home for his children and then later built a schoolhouse close to the home where the children were taught the basics of education as well as manners of conduct. Following elementary education his children were encouraged and assisted in furthering their knowledge and skills in their chosen fields of study.<br><br>Brigham Young lived by the words he taught:<br><br><i>We are the guardians of our children; their training and education are committed to our care, and if we do not ourselves pursue a course which will save them from the influence of evil, when we are weighed in the balance we shall be found wanting.</i>[In Dean C. Jessee,<i>Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), introduction, xxix]<br><br>Much of his greatness as a prophet and leader and father was in his practical approach to life and to education. He taught that the gospel is to be our guide for daily living. He felt and taught that "the religion of Jesus Christ is a matter-of-fact religion, and taketh hold of the every-day duties and realities of this life" (<i>JD</i>11:133).<br><br>Although he encouraged learning and education in "every kind of useful studies," he stressed that it is vital for us to learn and live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br><br>He felt that the spiritual and temporal aspects of the gospel are as one in the mind of God. He taught:<br><br><i>If I am in the line of my duty, I am doing the will of God, whether I am preaching, praying, laboring with my hands for an honorable support; whether I am in the field, mechanic's shop, or following mercantile business, or wherever duty calls, I am serving God as much in one place as another; and so it is with all, each in his place, turn and time.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:260]<br><br>Brigham Young's vision of education for his family and for members of the Church is practical for us in our "place, turn and time." During this demanding time of educational studies and pursuits, it is good for us to be reminded of the practical teachings of the gospel and their place as priorities in our lives.<br><br>I would like to focus on just a few of those practical teachings that I shall call the "simple things."<br><br>Prayer is one principle and privilege that may be so simple an act that we fail to recognize its power and importance in our lives.<br><br>We sing in a hymn, "Prayer is the simplest form of speech / That infant lips can try" ("Prayer Is the Soul's Sincere Desire,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 145). The smallest child can learn to pray daily and to recognize the guidance and blessings of a loving Heavenly Father.<br><br>Recently our 11-year-old grandson Clark was trying with all his energies and effort to get the lawn mower started so that he could complete the task of having the lawn mowed before his father returned from meeting me at the airport. Clark is a dutiful boy and wanted to please his father and his grandfather by having the lawn looking its best. Finally, after many frustrating moments of trying without success to get the mower started, he went to the telephone to call his mother, who was at a rehearsal at the church. She was there to preview a pageant that was being prepared for their stake youth conference and had been listening to words of scripture and testimony of prophets of the Book of Mormon from member-actors who were portraying Nephi, Alma, Helaman, and a mother of a stripling warrior.<br><br>Therefore, when Clark asked his mother what he should do, her first thought was to say: "Pray about it!"<br><br>Clark's first thought was "Pray about starting a lawn mower!?" But, "stripling warrior" that he is, he didn't doubt his mother, and he didn't doubt the Lord. He thought, "Well, God created this whole world! Of course He can start a lawn mower!" He knew when he went back to try again the lawn mower would start. And it did, with very little effort from Clark. Then Clark prayed again, this time to say "Thank you." This simple faith of a young boy brought an answer to his earnest prayer when he needed help.<br><br>Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Were I to draw a distinction in all the duties that are required of the children of men, from first to last, I would place first and foremost the duty of seeking unto the Lord our God until we open the path of communication from heaven to earth--from God to our own souls.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:339]<br><br>To one of his sons who was attending a university in New York, Brigham Young wrote:<br><br><i>As you advance in life you will find every position and occupation surrounded by its peculiar temptations, the great strength and bulwark against all of which is prayer to our Heavenly Father. Cultivate this spirit and you will find that it shall be a wall of fire around you, and your glory in the midst of you. In its practice you will find a safeguard against the wiles of the adversary, and every good resolution will be fortified by it, and every seductive influence will lose its power to annoy you.</i>[In Jessee,<i>Letters,</i>introduction, xxxv]<br><br>To the members of the Church, Brigham Young admonished, "Ask him to put you just where he wants you, and to tell you what he wants you to do, and feel that you are on hand to do it" (<i>JD</i>6:43).<br><br>Of all the wealth of information available to you as students of this university and out of the great amount of knowledge that you are trying to gain, can there be anything more important for you to know than the will of God for you--where He wants you to be and what He wants you to do?<br><br>He has provided you with a way to know. He has given to you--to all of us--the simple but powerful principle and privilege of prayer.<br><br>In October 2000 general conference, President Hinckley gave us this instruction:<br><br><i>There is no other resource to compare with prayer. To think that each of us may approach our Father in Heaven, who is the great God of the universe, for individual help and guidance, for strength and faith, is a miracle in and of itself. We come to Him by invitation. Let us not shun the opportunity which He has afforded us.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Great Shall Be the Peace of Thy Children," November 2000, 53]<br><br>President Hinckley has further expressed the need for us to seek more diligently to obtain the Spirit of the Lord and let it be the governing influence in our lives.<br><br>Seeking to know the will of our Father in Heaven through prayer and desiring strength to do His will draws Him near to us. This practice brings us to a unity with Him of direction and purpose. He has made it easy for us to communicate with Him. He has given us a pattern for prayer and has made Himself always available to us. He has told us to "pray often," to "pray continually," and to have a prayer in our heart always so that we might not be led into temptation.<br><br>Although the act of praying is simple, answers to prayers are not always that simple to recognize. However, the Lord has given us a means of identifying His answers.<br><br>Remember His words to Oliver Cowdery:<br><br><i>Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>When He brings our mind and heart into harmony on the matter about which we are praying, we have experienced the spirit of revelation and therefore have the answers to our prayers.<br><br>Most often an answer to prayer comes simply as a feeling of peace. The Lord's response to Oliver Cowdery was, "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23).<br><br>There are times when we may feel that peace and therefore be certain that we have received an answer to our prayers. We feel inspired to pursue a particular course of action, and then we encounter bumps in our road or obstacles in our way. We may run into a darkness or fog that slows us down or blocks our view of the desired destination. Doubts or questions may arise concerning the source of our inspiration. We may even feel that the Lord didn't hear our prayers after all or that we are unworthy of the blessing we have asked for. We may even be tempted to turn away from the inspiration we have received or to seek another answer from the Lord--perhaps a different or easier course could be found. We may even become discouraged enough to quit praying.<br><br>Brigham Young had some teachings on that subject, too. He said:<br><br><i>Let no person give up prayer because he has not the spirit of prayer, neither let any earthly circumstance hurry you while in the performance of this important duty. By bowing down before the Lord to ask Him to bless you, you will simply find this result--God will multiply blessings on you temporally and spiritually.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:103]<br><br>It is important, therefore, for us to continue to pray as the Lord has taught--with real intent and with all the energies of our heart. We must pray for the spirit of peace to be with us and for strength of faith to do what is required for the Spirit to remain with us. Trust in Him and stay the course. Leave the matter in the Lord's hands and have faith in His timetable. We should not counsel the Lord nor try to predict how our prayer should be answered.<br><br>Brigham Young said we should keep our "spirit, feelings and conscience like a sheet of blank paper, and let the Spirit and power of God write upon it what he pleases. When he writes I will read; but if I read before he writes, I am very likely to be wrong" (<i>JD</i>14:79).<br><br>Brigham Young also said, "Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us, let us inquire what we can do for ourselves" (<i>JD</i>9:172).<br><br>Answers to some prayers may require fasting--another simple thing we can do to draw nearer to the Lord and one of the few things we can do to give of ourselves to Him. Often answers to our prayers may be found in a simple verse of scripture. It has been said that when we want to talk to the Lord, we pray. When we want Him to talk to us, we read the scriptures.<br><br>"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21).<br><br>Obedience in doing the simple things has always been the means of obtaining the greatest blessings of the Lord.<br><br>Remember the story of Naaman:<br><br><i>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</i>[2 Kings 5:1]<br><br>At the direction of his king, Naaman went to Elisha the prophet to be healed of his dreaded affliction.<br><br><i>Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</i><br><br><i>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</i><br><br><i>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. . . .</i><br><br><i>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</i><br><br><i>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</i>[2 Kings 5:9–11, 13–14]<br><br>Are we not all sometimes like Naaman, looking for big and important things to do and bypassing the simple acts that could improve and heal our lives and bless the lives of others?<br><br>Several years ago President Howard W. Hunter gave a devotional address to the students of this university entitled "What Is True Greatness?" He taught that "the achievement of true greatness . . . always requires regular, consistent, small, and sometimes ordinary and mundane steps over a long period of time" (in<i>BYU 1986–87 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1987], 115).<br><br>President Hunter taught this lesson to me in a very personal way. The first time I met him was when I was called to his office to be set apart for an assignment on a general board. He greeted me very kindly and discussed with me the opportunities I would have as I served in this new calling. He commended me, smiled at me, and then, in his gentle, kind manner, he humbled me by telling me it was not difficult to find people to serve in that assignment. He said if we were to step outside and stop the next 100 members of the Church who passed in front of the Church Administration Building, almost all of them would be able and willing to serve in that same calling.<br><br>Then he asked, "Do you know what we need in the Church, Brother Pinegar?" I just sat there, not knowing how to respond, and he didn't really wait for my answer. "What we need," he continued, "are home teachers. That is the great need in the Church today."<br><br>As he placed his hands on my head, I was uncertain what Elder Hunter would say. I thought he might set me apart as a home teacher, but in his pleasant, reassuring manner he set me apart and gave me a blessing that I would be able to fulfill my new calling. I promised myself that I would be a better home teacher.<br><br>The calling of a home teacher--and many other callings--may seem small when compared to some leadership positions in the Church, but any calling faithfully fulfilled can be of inestimable value to you and to others.<br><br>President Hunter said, "Frequently it is the commonplace tasks that have the greatest positive effect on the lives of others" ("What Is True Greatness?" 115).<br><br>As a teenage boy I worked for a building contractor pouring concrete foundations, driveways, and sidewalks for homes. I learned that concrete was made up of a mixture of very simple elements that of themselves were not stable enough for a foundation. But mixed together in proper sequence and proportions, tiny grains of sand, small pebbles, water, and cement powder form a unique substance of unusual strength and durability. For a few hours after the concrete is mixed, it can be poured into any desired form. At first, before it is completely hardened, even a tiny bird hopping across its soft surface will leave an imprint. Later, however, it becomes so firm an elephant could walk over it without leaving any tracks.<br><br>Just as a few simple elements combined in a proper way form a sturdy foundation for a house, so do the simple teachings of the gospel bond together to make a strong foundation for our lives.<br><br>In contrast, we must be aware that there are small things that can destroy rather than build or strengthen us. For instance, tiny grains of salt sprinkled on concrete, if they are not removed, can actually cause it to break up and crumble. Similarly, small steps taken in the direction of wrongdoing, ignored or uncorrected, will weaken and destroy our lives. Big problems grow out of thinking that little things--wrongs--won't matter.<br><br>President James E. Faust quoted President George Albert Smith when he addressed the priesthood session in general conference last October:<br><br><i>If you cross to the devil's side of the line one inch, you are in the tempter's power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the Lord.</i>[George Albert Smith,<i>Sharing the Gospel with Others,</i>ed. Preston Nibley (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1948), 43; quoted in Faust, "The Enemy Within,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 45, 46]<br><br>Let us choose to do the little things that come to us under the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, and the big things we face will assume their proper perspective in the eternal scope of things.<br><br>President David O. McKay also spoke of the positive power of small and simple acts:<br><br><i>There is no one great thing that we can do to obtain eternal life, and it seems to me that the great lesson to be learned in the world today is to apply in the little acts and duties of life the glorious principles of the Gospel. Let us not think that because some of the things . . . may seem small and trivial, that they are unimportant. Life, after all, is made up of little things. Our life, our being, physically, is made up here of little heart beats. Let that little heart stop beating, and life in this world ceases. The great sun is a mighty force in the universe, but we receive the blessings of his rays because they come to us as little beams, which, taken in the aggregate, fill the whole world with sunlight. The dark night is made pleasant by the glimmer of what seem to be little stars; and so the true Christian life is made up of little Christ-like acts performed this hour, this minute, in the home, in the quorum, in the organization, in the town, wherever our life and acts may be cast.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>October 1914, 87–88]<br><br>Elder Hartman Rector, Jr., was a fairly recent convert of the Church when he was called to the First Council of the Seventy. In a conference address in 1994 he taught a simple message that has had a great impact. He began, "I have found the gospel to be very simple, but also very profound." He observed that after baptism, "it appears that all the Father requires of us is that we endure to the end. . . . I believe it means basically three things. One: . . . repent. . . . Two: . . . forgive others. . . . And three: Yes, we must be nice. If we're not nice, I don't think we're going to make it" (Hartman Rector, Jr., "Endure to the End in Charity,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, 25, 26).<br><br>President Hunter's mother, Nellie, taught her son, a future prophet, "It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice" (in Leonard J. Arrington, Susan Arrington Madsen, Emily Madsen Jones,<i>Mothers of the Prophets,</i>rev. ed. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987, 2001], 240).<br><br>Being "nice" is part of those "every-day duties and realities" spoken of by Brigham Young. It should come naturally to those who are striving to follow the example and teachings of the Savior. Simple acts of kindness--a kind word, a friendly hello, a thoughtful deed, even a smile--can make a great difference in the life of one who is lonely or troubled or without hope. We may assist the Lord in bringing a blessing or even a miracle by the simple act of being nice.<br><br>It is by our good conduct that we demonstrate charity--the true love of Christ. We emulate and honor Him by our willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for the welfare and happiness of another. The Christlike qualities of selflessness, patience, honesty, and integrity are the most valuable assets we can acquire that will bless the lives of others as well as our own and should be demonstrated in all of our associations and endeavors.<br><br>In Brigham Young's words:<br><br><i>I . . . feel to urge upon the Latter-day Saints the necessity of a close application of the principles of the gospel in our lives, conduct and words and all that we do; and it requires the whole man, the whole life to be devoted to improvement in order to come to knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. Herein is the fullness of perfection.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:255–56]<br><br>Through living these simple principles, you and I will find great blessings of enlightenment, enabling us to make a greater contribution of good in the lives of others. And we will learn, as Brigham Young declared, that "the religion of Jesus Christ is a matter-of-fact religion" that influences every duty and reality of life (<i>JD</i>11:133).<br><br>I bear witness of Jesus Christ, that He lives, that His gospel deserves our very best effort in its application in our lives. Put the simple things first so that your other studies will be seen in their proper light. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Rex D. Pinegar was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 June 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>l Cataracts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a humbling experience to speak with you this morning and to have present friends, family, missionaries, colleagues, and many others. As I reflected on the message I wanted to share today, I was reminded of an experience my mother-in-law, Helen Thomas, had a few years ago. She noticed that her vision was deteriorating. The images she saw were becoming increasingly blurred and faint. Finally she scheduled an eye exam and was told she had cataracts. Fortunately she was able to have corrective surgery, which restored her vision. My mother-in-law was so excited after the operation, she said, "I hadn't realized how much my eyesight had changed. I have not been able to see this well for years. My vision must have changed just a little bit at a time."<br><br>There are important lessons in this experience for all of us. Thus I will first talk about cataracts and their causes, consequences, and correction. Then I will draw a parallel between the causes and prevention of cataracts with what we might refer to as the causes and prevention of spiritual cataracts.<br><br>Now let's talk about cataracts. Many cataracts begin as small spots or specks in the lens of the eye. These spots interfere with light rays that pass through the lens to be focused as an image on the retina in the back of the eye. The greater the number of specks, the more obscure the image. These specks can become so dense that the entire lens becomes milky white, and the light rays can't pass through the lens, resulting in blindness.<i>But it is important to remember that the light is still there; it just can't pass through the lens of the eye.</i><br><br>The effects of cataracts can be illustrated by looking at the stars. If you are high up in the mountains and look at the stars on a clear night, their images are sharp and crystal clear. In a setting like that, it is inspirational to look at the North Star and the numerous other constellations that have fascinated countless generations. However, if you try to look at the same stars from a highly populated area, the stars will appear fuzzy or may seem to disappear because of the physical pollutants in the atmosphere. Just like cataracts in the lens of the eye, the physical pollutants in the atmosphere deflect or block the light rays and obscure the image of the stars so that they appear fuzzy. Even if the light from the stars isn't visible to the naked eye, the stars are still there.<br><br>In the early days of navigation, the North Star was used to guide ships to their desired destinations. However, this was not possible when the skies were overcast. Just as those sailors were without guidance on overcast nights, those with severe cataracts miss many things. They may not be able to see the vibrant fall colors on a drive up the canyon or see the excited smile on the face of a newly baptized member of the Church or see the radiant glow of a new bride as she kneels at the altar in the temple. Cataracts, if left uncorrected, can lead to complete blindness, and it often happens just a little bit at a time.<br><br>As I mentioned, my mother-in-law's vision had not deteriorated that far, and she was able to have corrective surgery that restored her eyesight. The operation involved removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with a clear plastic lens that would again let the light rays pass through and focus on the retina as a sharp image.<br><br>The more I thought about my mother-in-law's experience with cataracts, the more I thought about some different types of cataracts--not cataracts on our physical eyes, but something far more serious: cataracts on our spiritual eyes. Now let's consider some of the important parallels and lessons we can learn by comparing physical and spiritual cataracts.<br><br>Numerous scriptures seem to refer to spiritual cataracts. We repeatedly read of those having eyes and seeing not and of those whose eyes have been darkened (see Jeremiah 5:21; Mark 8:18; Psalm 69:23). And Nephi warned, "Wo unto the blind that<i>will not</i>see; for they shall perish" (2 Nephi 9:32; emphasis added). Whom else could these scriptures refer to, other than those with<i>spiritual cataracts?</i><br><br>Specifically, let us remember Laman and Lemuel. They had seen an angel and had "heard his voice from time to time," but they eventually reached a point where they were "past feeling" (1 Nephi 17:45). Their spiritual eyes had become blind, "and there was nothing save it were the power of God, which threatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts" (1 Nephi 18:20).<br><br>So what is it that those with spiritual cataracts are not seeing? Those with spiritual cataracts have lost sight of spiritual light. What is the light?<br><br>In 3 Nephi 18:16, Christ told the Nephites, "Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you." Christ is our North Star. He is the source of our light and understanding (see 2 Nephi 31:3). Just as sailors steered by the light of the North Star, so should we steer our lives by the light of Christ's example, His teachings, and His glory.<br><br>For 200 years after Christ's ministry to the people of Nephi in the Americas, members of His Church focused their eyes and their hearts on the Lord and were greatly blessed. We read in 4 Nephi:<br><br><i>There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. . . .</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and</i>surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. [4 Nephi 1:15–16; emphasis added]<br><br>This wonderful state lasted for about 200 years, until spiritual cataracts began to cloud the people's spiritual lenses. And you know what happened after that. As they<i>lost sight</i>of Christ, they fell into paths of iniquity, and the Nephite nation was eventually destroyed.<br><br>When our spiritual vision is clear, we are happy. How then are spiritual cataracts developed and what happens when we lose that vision? King Benjamin told us specifically what happens when we lose sight of the Savior by falling into transgression. He said:<br><br><i>And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved.</i>[Mosiah 2:36]<br><br>Thus we see that transgression is a serious spiritual pollutant that will cloud our spiritual lenses, blur our image of the Savior, and weaken our resolve to live as He would have us live. Let me discuss four of the spiritual pollutants or transgressions that are mentioned in the verses from 4 Nephi.<br><br>The first pollutant mentioned by Nephi is envy. Do you ever find yourself being envious of others? Someone from the BYU counseling office recently told me that one of the major issues worrying students is their educational progress. This concern often involves interpersonal comparisons. Why is it that we so often compare ourselves with someone who maybe does better in a class or seems to have more friends, better clothes, or perhaps a nicer car? These interpersonal comparisons are often spiritually destructive.<br><br>The scriptures help us keep interpersonal comparisons in a proper prospective. In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord told William Phelps to "stand in the office" to which he was appointed and to repent, "for he seeketh to excel" and he was not "sufficiently meek" (D&amp;amp;C 58:40–41).<br><br>We might ask ourselves the question "Well, what is wrong with excelling? Are we not supposed to excel?" In discussing this with John Tanner from the English Department, John mentioned that the Greek root of the word<i>excel</i>refers to being better than everyone else. Maybe the objective should not be to be better than others but merely to do our best.<br><br>John mentioned that additional understanding of this issue can be found in the life of Oliver Granger. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read that Oliver Granger's name "shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 117:12).<br><br>What did Oliver Granger do to earn such a powerful promise? Oliver Granger was not an apostle. He did not accumulate great personal wealth. So what did he do? Well, Oliver Granger was sent back to Kirtland to help dispose of Church property after the Saints left. These were difficult times for the Church. But Oliver did as he was asked and performed his assignment in such a manner that he received compliments from members and nonmembers alike.<br><br>Greater insight into what matters to the Lord is found in verse 13 of section 117. Speaking of Oliver Granger, the Lord said: "His sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase." (See Susan Easton Black,<i>Who's Who in the Doctrine and Covenants</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 107–9.)<br><br>Thus it appears that the Lord cares more about sacrifice and having a willing heart and mind than He does about whether we win, lose, or accumulate material possessions.<br><br>Dishonesty and lying are other pollutants or transgressions that will cloud our spiritual vision. The Duke University Center for Academic Integrity conducted a survey of 22 universities in the United States. The purpose of the survey was to assess the level of honesty among students. BYU was included in the survey. BYU students set a high standard with 92 percent of the students reporting they had never seen another student cheat during their time at the university. This compares with a national norm of 55 percent. (See<i>Academic Integrity Study: Fall 1999, A Report of BYU Responses Compared to Normative Group,</i>administered by the Center for Academic Integrity at Duke University and prepared by the BYU Office of Assessment, April 2000.)<br><br>After we have congratulated ourselves, we might step back and just take a more detailed inventory. One example we might consider is writing term papers. The cut-and-paste computer technology makes it relatively simple to splice together other people's ideas into our own papers. However, in finalizing our term papers we must give appropriate credit for other people's ideas or it is plagiarism. Now let us examine our actions in other areas that might easily be overlooked. Do we make unauthorized copies of music or movies? Do we only use computer software we have purchased or that is available as shareware in the public domain? Are we honest in these important areas as well?<br><br>What are the consequences of envy, lying, or pride? We read in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants that "when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise . . . unrighteous dominion . . . ; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved" and is withdrawn (D&amp;amp;C 121:37).<i>This is when our spiritual vision becomes blurred.</i><br><br>Tumults and contention are other pollutants mentioned in 4 Nephi. Do you find yourself being contentious or argumentative? Do you find yourself picking fights with roommates or with a spouse? Do you find yourself criticizing Church leaders? What are the consequences of contention? Nephi answered that question, teaching us that Satan "is the father of contention" (3 Nephi 11:29), and we know the Spirit withdraws from those who become subject to the spirit of Satan (see Alma 34:35).<i>The result of contention is that our spiritual vision becomes obscured.</i><br><br>We can illustrate the importance of harmony to the presence of the Spirit with a story from the life of Joseph and Emma Smith. David Whitmer recorded the following:<br><br><i>One morning when he</i>[Joseph Smith]<i>was getting ready to continue the translation, something went wrong about the house and he</i>[Joseph]<i>was put out about it. Something that Emma, his wife, had done. Oliver and I went upstairs and Joseph came up soon after to continue the translation but he could not do anything. He could not translate a single syllable. He went downstairs, out into the orchard, and made supplication to the Lord; was gone about an hour--came back to the house, and asked Emma's forgiveness and then came upstairs where we were and then the translation went on all right.</i>[In B. H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Century One</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1930), 1:131]<br><br>Joseph Smith lost his spiritual vision because of contention. He was told to resolve the conflict, and then his "vision" was restored. Thus we see the spiritual impact of contention and how its resolution leads to a restoration of our spiritual sight.<br><br>A fourth spiritual pollutant mentioned by Nephi is lasciviousness, which includes lust and pornography. This problem is real, it is addictive, and, unfortunately, it is too common. Various Church leaders have warned it is more addictive than drugs. This was echoed by a letter I recently received from someone pleading for help with this problem. Visual images are difficult to forget. We all know the tragic story of David of old, whose fascination with the bathing Bathsheba led to adultery, deceit, and murder (see 2 Samuel 11). The accessibility of movies, magazines, and the Internet brings the problem right into our homes. This is a deadly practice. Don't be deceived. It can creep up on you a little bit at a time. Don't take chances. Avoid it as you would the plague, staying as far from it as you can. If you even have the beginning of a problem, please visit with your bishop.<br><br>What are the consequences of lasciviousness? We read in section 42 of the Doctrine and Covenants that "he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her . . . shall not have the Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 42:23).<i>And his spiritual vision becomes darkened.</i><br><br>There are, of course, many additional spiritual pollutants. King Benjamin told us that they are so numerous that they cannot be numbered and that we need to watch our thoughts, words, and deeds and observe the commandments of God (see Mosiah 4:29–30).<br><br>As we allow pollutants of any kind to affect our spiritual lenses or to remain unchecked, each additional pollutant causes increased blurring of our spiritual vision and causes us to withdraw from the Spirit of the Lord. However, in spite of our spiritual cataracts,<i>the Lord is still there. We have just let what matters less get in the way of what matters most.</i><br><br>Fortunately, just as with physical cataracts, where corrective surgery holds the promise of a restoration of our physical sight, repentance holds the hope for a restoration of our spiritual sight and being able to return to our Father in Heaven.<br><br>The Lord has told us that if we will repent of our sins, He will remember them no more (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42) and that as often as we repent and seek forgiveness with real intent, we will be forgiven (see Moroni 6:8).<br><br>My mother-in-law was ecstatic about the restoration of her physical vision. Similarly, how great is the joy of those who fully repent and return to the Lord. Christ changes our hearts, awakens us out of a deep sleep, and illuminates our souls by the light of His everlasting word (see Alma 5:7). A repentant Alma the Younger described his feelings by saying, "There can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy" (Alma 36:21). The choicest blessings in the world are those of a spiritual nature. Spiritual blessings endure and leave a love and a peace in our hearts. They come from having a spiritual vision unobstructed by spiritual cataracts.<br><br>However, just as there may be dangers in delaying cataract surgery too long, there are dangers in delaying repentance. Our spiritual cataracts can build up, a little bit at a time, until we become spiritually blind. The Lord told Joseph Smith in the Doctrine and Covenants, "He that repents not, from him shall be taken even the<i>light</i>which he has received" (D&amp;amp;C 1:33; emphasis added).<br><br>Let me share one such example from Church history. On February 14, 1835, Lyman Johnson was the first person in this dispensation to be called as an apostle to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The years of 1836 to 1838 were difficult times for the Saints in Kirtland, and many members faltered. Lyman Johnson was one of those who faltered, and in April 1838 he was excommunicated from the Church. (See Black,<i>Who's Who,</i>158–59.)<br><br>Lyman remained friendly to the Saints, but it is clear that his spiritual vision was obscured by cataracts. To some of the brethren, Lyman later stated:<br><br><i>"I would give anything, I would suffer my right hand to be cut off, if I could believe it</i>[Mormonism]<i>again. Then I was full of joy and gladness. My dreams were pleasant. When I awoke in the morning my spirit was cheerful. I was happy by day and by night, full of peace and joy and thanksgiving. But now it is darkness, pain, sorrow, misery in the extreme. I have never since seen a happy moment."</i>[Quoted by Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>19:41<br><br>What a terrible tragedy. Although you may feel secure in the faith and immune from temptation or spiritual pollutants, it is important to remember that Lyman Johnson was a member of the Twelve. Yet he apostatized and denied the faith. Lyman Johnson suffered from spiritual cataracts. He did not wake up one morning and say, "Today I'm going to apostatize from the Church." Nor did David, one chosen of God, wake up one morning and decide to commit adultery and murder; but he did happen to see a woman bathing, and he did not look away, and the scriptures tell us that he "enquired" after her (2 Samuel 11:3).<br><br>Do we ever enquire after things that obscure our vision of the Lord? The specks on David's spiritual lenses caused by lasciviousness continued to grow and cloud his spiritual vision until he lost both the Spirit and the eternal perspective he once had. Generally, others who have fallen do not decide in an instant, after living a clean and virtuous life, to commit grievous sins. Rather, it usually begins with a small transgression that continues to grow unchecked. It generally happens just a little bit at a time, and so, unless we are careful, it will with us as well.<br><br>We have talked about the causes, consequences, and correction of cataracts. Now let us turn to the question about the prevention of cataracts and explore further the important parallel between physical and spiritual cataracts. First, concerning physical cataracts, there is medical evidence that certain vitamins and medications--often referred to as antioxidants--if taken daily, or at least regularly, can actually help prevent the growth of cataracts.<br><br>How about preventive measures for spiritual cataracts? Are there such things as spiritual antioxidants? Since the specks on our spiritual lenses are transgressions, the role of spiritual antioxidants is to prevent transgression. Thus, in the most general sense, the universal spiritual antioxidant is obedience to the commandments of God. We have been promised that as we draw near unto the Lord, He will draw near unto us; that as we seek Him, we shall find Him (see D&amp;amp;C 88:63). And, ultimately, the Lord has told us<br><br><i>that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;</i><br><br><i>And that I am the</i>true light<i>that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1–2; emphasis added]<br><br>What a wonderful promise! When we repent and keep the commandments, we will retain our spiritual vision and know that Christ is the Light of the World. Now, specifically, how do we do that?<br><br>The scriptures prescribe some marvelous spiritual antioxidants that, if taken daily or at least regularly, will help prevent spiritual cataracts. Let me mention three of these spiritual antioxidants and the associated scriptural promises or guarantees. These spiritual antioxidants are not complicated. In fact, they are so basic that you may be tired of hearing about them--for we hear of them often. Nevertheless, the promises associated with them are real. Let us not falter because of the easiness of the way. They may be easy, but let us be certain to take them daily as they have been prescribed.<br><br>The first spiritual antioxidant is prayer. It is interesting that in three of the four Gospels, the disciples record Jesus' admonition given them in the Garden of Gethsemane to "watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation" (Matthew 26:41; see also Mark 14:38; Luke 22:40, 46).<br><br>Thus we learn that prayer helps us avoid temptation--and therefore avoid sin--keeping our spiritual lenses clear. Now, how often should we pray so that we may conquer temptation?<br><br>Variations of this counsel are found in both the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenants (see 3 Nephi 18:15; D&amp;amp;C 31:12). These variations nearly always contain the phrase "pray always." Specifically, Joseph Smith was told to "pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan" (D&amp;amp;C 10:5) Therefore, the prescription of prayer is one that should be taken at least daily.<br><br>The Nephites also benefited from the power of frequent prayer. Helaman recorded that as his people prayed often, their hearts were purified and sanctified (see Helaman 3:35). In other words, their spiritual lenses were kept clean as they prayed and yielded their hearts unto God.<br><br>Helaman also taught us:<br><br><i>Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--</i><br><br><i>And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven.</i>[Helaman 3:29–30]<br><br>This brings us to our second spiritual antioxidant for clear spiritual vision--studying the word of God. From Helaman's words we learn that similar to frequent prayer, using the scriptures will help us cut through the snares of the devil to conquer Satan and therefore resist temptation. This is a powerful promise--one that we all desperately need.<br><br>Again, scripture study is a prescription. How often should it be taken? The Lord commanded Joshua, "Thou shalt meditate [on the scriptures] day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein" (Joshua 1:8). He also promised us that "whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived" (JS--M 1:37).<br><br>I would like to share with you the experience of a friend of mine from the mission field that illustrates the power of scripture. Terry Barrett was sent to fight in Vietnam in 1966. He returned home in 1967 with a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal for valor and heroism. To deaden the emotional pains associated with the atrocities of the war, Terry turned to alcohol and soon became addicted. Then, in 1998 he faced a major surgical procedure. Not being LDS, he was hesitant to receive a priesthood blessing from an LDS friend. Finally, however, Terry consented and received the blessing. Concerning that blessing, he says, "I felt a peace I had never felt before, and a voice said, 'It will be all right, Terry.'"<br><br>As a result of the blessing, his hunger and thirst for alcohol was instantaneously and miraculously transformed into a hunger and thirst for the scriptures. He says, "To this day I cannot get enough of the scriptures and the Spirit." He attends institute three days a week. Terry, his wife, and his daughter were baptized and have been to the temple. He is eternally grateful for the scriptures and the relationship that he now has with the Lord.<br><br>Just as the word of God acted as a compass in Terry's life--giving him an eternal perspective--we have been promised that it can do so for us, steering us clear of the deception and temptation of Satan. In Alma's parting words to his son Helaman (Alma 37:38–47), Alma likened the word of God to a personal Liahona, which will point us in a straight course to a far better land of promise. He said, "The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever." He then pleaded, "And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things [the scriptures], yea, see that ye look to God and live" (Alma 37:46–47).<br><br>The third and final spiritual antioxidant I will discuss is service. In King Benjamin's famous address from his tower, he instructed his people that "for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, . . . I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor" (Mosiah 4:26). Translated to our vernacular, that means: To maintain spiritual vision unclouded by sin, on a daily basis we need to serve others.<br><br>Daily Christlike service is an important spiritual antioxidant that helps rinse spiritual pollutants from our eyes and also allows us to maintain our focus on the Savior.<br><br>Again, drawing on the words of King Benjamin, we learn that we cannot know our Savior unless we have served Him. And we best serve Him by serving our fellowmen (see Mosiah 2:17; 5:13).<br><br>Thus daily prayer, daily scripture study, and daily service are three important spiritual antioxidants that help guarantee we will retain our spiritual vision and have the Spirit to guide us in our day-to-day activities. Are we taking our daily doses regularly?<br><br>The Lord gave us a beautiful promise for having 20/20 spiritual vision:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify</i>[or cleanse]<i>yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67–68]<br><br>Let me invite each of you to perform a spiritual eye exam. Let us evaluate how clear our vision of the Savior is right now. Next, if necessary, schedule the restorative surgery of repentance. And, finally, remember to diligently and deliberately take our daily doses of prayer, scripture study, and service and obey the commandments of God.<br><br>I pray that we will so sanctify ourselves that we may be found among the pure in heart and share in the promise given in the Beatitudes that we will see God.<br><br>I want to share my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Savior and the Redeemer of the World, that He loves us. He is my North Star. He points the way. Through daily prayer and daily scripture study, I know of His will. Through daily service I feel of His love. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James B.

<h1>Thine Eyes to the Mountains - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled by the invitation to speak today. As I have prepared my remarks, I have had particularly in mind the 900 new freshmen who arrived on campus less than two weeks ago. The rest of you will, I hope, find something of value in what I say, but I especially pray that I can help the youngest students among us understand some of the unique opportunities that lie before you.<br><br>I have entitled my remarks "Lift Up Thine Eyes to the Mountains." This title was inspired by an experience I had two years ago. I like to vacation in the mountains, yet the summer of 1999 was the first time I had ever traveled to nearby Wyoming to visit the Grand Tetons. A friend and I arrived at the national park in the late afternoon. As we drove along the park road to get closer to those majestic peaks, we noticed an area where we could pull off and read signs telling us the names and geologic history of the mountains. As we stood outside the car, drinking in the beauty of the scene, a van pulled off the road and parked beside our car, and a couple probably in their early forties got out to admire the mountains, too.<br><br>I noticed that the license plate on their van indicated they were from one of the flat midwestern states, and I thought perhaps the mountains would be especially awe-inspiring to them. As I turned to go back to the car, I noticed in the rear of their van two teenaged boys--presumably the sons of this couple--seated with their backs to the Grand Tetons and showing absolutely no interest in looking at them. One boy had headphones on and his eyes shut, apparently caught up in whatever he was listening to. The other had his nose in a magazine, doggedly reading, seemingly oblivious to the beauty that surrounded him.<br><br>Now I don't know why these two boys were ignoring the view; maybe it was the last day of their trip and they had already seen enough. But, unfairly or not, I imagined that they had come on vacation at their parents' insistence, and now, just to show how cool they were, they were refusing to be impressed by the sights their parents had brought them to see.<br><br>As I drove away from this family, I thought that many of us often behave in the way these boys did: There are inspiring things our Father in Heaven wants to show us and wonderful experiences He wants to give us, yet we are so absorbed in trivial, worldly interests that we sometimes turn our backs to the thrilling views of eternity that are available if we would only lift up our eyes and see.<br><br>Today my desire is to help us all lift up our eyes and see the heights to which we may aspire if we will take full advantage of the opportunities offered us here. Brigham Young University exists in large part to help The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fulfill its mission. The mission of the university, as stated in this little blue booklet, "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." The mission statement declares that "all students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Any education is inadequate which does not emphasize that His is the only name given under heaven whereby mankind can be saved" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1996], 1). As President Spencer W. Kimball said in a 1967 address, BYU should provide "education for eternity." The faculty here, he stated, have a double heritage and a double responsibility to preserve and teach not only the knowledge of men but "the revealed truths sent from heaven" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1967</i>[Provo: BYU, 1968], 2).<br><br>Included with the mission statement in the blue booklet are<i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i>approved by the board of trustees in 1995. A BYU education should "be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service" (<i>Mission and Aims,</i>3). We faculty members are frequently encouraged to read this booklet and to incorporate the four aims into our teaching. Yet I wonder how often students take the time to read and ponder the words that elaborate on the four aims. I hope that you will read the complete statement of the mission and aims. They are available on the Internet as a link from the BYU homepage and are also printed in the catalog. I recommend you read them at least once a semester to remind yourself of the higher goals you should have beyond merely passing courses and accumulating credits for graduation.<br><br>To me, each of these aims is like a mountain peak--or, more accurately, each is like a facet of a single towering mountain that we are invited not only to look at but to climb. In many ways we faculty can only do like the parents in the story I related. We can bring you students to the mountain, we can encourage you, and we can try to model the behavior that we hope you will choose. But you must make the effort to lift up your eyes and then to scale the peak through your diligence. This university will achieve its divine destiny only as faculty, staff, and students unite and help each other in the climb upward.<br><br>I wish to speak about each of the four aims, suggesting things that may help us ascend together. I propose that in striving to achieve the aims of a BYU education, you will simultaneously be advancing in your quest for perfection and eternal life--a quest that we must always remember is made possible only through the love and the Atonement of the Savior.<br><h2><b>Building Character</b></h2><br>I will start with the third aim of "character building" for reasons that I think will become clear. For centuries the ultimate goal of education in Western civilization was the formation of students' character. True, in each period of the past students were taught what was known in every branch of learning. But they were taught such things as oratory, languages, philosophy, literature, music, and mathematics to increase their wisdom and judgment and to enable them to serve their societies. Education was to engender virtue, and the morality of students was the constant concern of most teachers from ancient Greece through the first hundred-plus years of the United States. In this country up until about 1890, the last course that students took at college was moral philosophy, a course considered so important it was usually taught by the college president (see Jeffrey R. Holland,<i>A "Notion" at Risk,</i>pamphlet of address given at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., 22 March 1984, 7–8). Very few universities now attempt anything in the way of molding students' character. Most have capitulated to the relatively recent belief that the goal of higher education is to specialize in some area of learning so that one has the credentials to get a job and earn money--preferably lots of it.<br><br>I hope you will be grateful that one of the aims of BYU is not to prepare you to become wealthy but to build your character. President Kimball taught that BYU<br><br><i>has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service. ... It is not justified on an academic basis only.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "On My Honor," in<i>Devotional Speeches of the Year, 1978</i>(Provo: BYU Press, 1979), 137]<br><br>How can your experience at BYU help you develop the kind of Christlike character the aims document describes? Let me suggest a few things to consider.<br><br>Your character is formed by the things you think about, the daily decisions you make, and the actions that follow. How true are the words of this old saying:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap a habit;</i><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><br>[Quoted by Samuel Smiles (1812–1904) in<i>Life and Labor</i>(1887)]<br><br>How you choose to use your time, treat your family, interact with your friends and roommates, serve your employer, do your homework, fulfill your Church callings--all of these decisions and actions will contribute to your character. The Honor Code aims to instill in us "those moral virtues encompassed in the gospel of Jesus Christ" (Church Educational System Honor Code, available in university catalogs or from http://www.byu.edu/honorcode/honor_code.htm). If you will follow both the spirit and the letter of the Honor Code, you will develop traits of honesty, integrity, humility, and benevolence that will make you the kind of person who is sought after as a friend, an employee, and a spouse.<br><br>Your pledging to obey the Honor Code is an act of no small importance. Too many people today too easily break their promises and set aside commitments when it is no longer convenient to honor them. Such people diminish their own character and demonstrate the truth of the words spoken by Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's play<i>A Man for All Seasons.</i>In this play, More refuses to swear to the Act of Succession, because he cannot in good conscience approve of some of King Henry VIII's actions. When More is in danger of losing his life because of his refusal, his daughter Margaret urges him to swear the oath outwardly but in his heart to "think otherwise." More replies, "What is an oath then but words we say to God? ... When a man takes an oath, ... he's holding his own self in his own hands. Like water. And if he opens his fingers<i>then--</i>he needn't hope to find himself again" (Robert Bolt, "A Man for All Seasons," in<i>Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and the Essay,</i>2nd ed., ed. Robert DiYanni [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1990], 1497; emphasis in original). To make any commitment and then violate your promise is to let your character dribble away like water between your fingers. Honor the commitments you have made to parents, friends, roommates, teachers, employers, your bishop, and the Lord. Your character will grow more firm and steady each time you set aside your desire to do what is convenient and instead do what is right.<br><br>Let me suggest something else you might consider as you think about character development. In the October 2000 general conference of the Church, President Boyd K. Packer told of receiving his patriarchal blessing at the age of 18 after he had entered military service. The patriarch told Brother Packer, "Guard and protect [your body]--take nothing into it that shall harm the organs thereof because it is sacred. It is the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character." President Packer reiterated those words to all of us: "Your body really<i>is</i>the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character" (Boyd K. Packer, "Ye Are the Temple of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 72; emphasis in original).<br><br>I think of these words now as I walk across campus and pass students who have disabilities. Coping with blindness, deafness, motor impairments, and other challenges, these students have not allowed less-than-perfect bodies to stop them from seizing the opportunity to improve their minds. They have no doubt faced barriers and the temptation to settle for something less than a college education. But in overcoming adversity, they have built great strength of character. Their bodies--perhaps<i>because of</i>their disabilities--have become the foundations of characters marked by courage and persistence.<br><br>It is likewise with those who battle invisible challenges of chronic illness or mental and emotional conditions. They, too, can forge a sterling character in the fire of adversity. The same can be true for all. If we realize that our body is a great gift from God and our mortal parents, and if we treat that body with wisdom and respect, we can all lay the foundation for a strong character. All around us today we see two extremes where the body is concerned. At one extreme are those who seem to hate their bodies, scarring and defacing them with tattoos and multiple piercings. They use drugs and other substances that weaken and addict their bodies. To me such people seem to have tormented, unhappy characters. At the other extreme are those who are far too vain about their bodies. They are much too preoccupied with appearance. Goaded by media images of models and movie stars, they try to shape their bodies into unrealistic ideals through sometimes life-threatening practices. They spend excessively on fashionable clothing and myriad other products to use in or on the body. Trying to meet the world's narrow, shallow, and ever-changing standard of beauty, they may neglect to develop deeper, more lasting character traits. Such preoccupation with appearance calls to mind the words of Moroni, who, when he saw our day in vision, wrote this as he finished the record of his father, Mormon:<br><br><i>And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel....</i><br><br><i>For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel ... more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.</i><br><br>Then Moroni asks:<br><br><i>Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?</i>[Mormon 8:36–37, 39]<br><br>In verse 38 Moroni suggests an answer to his own question: People do these things for "the praise of the world"; they esteem being in fashion and having peer approval more than they esteem their fellowmen and the approbation of God.<br><br>In contrast to the extremes, the gospel teaches us to make our bodies attractive by keeping them clean, neatly groomed, and modestly clothed and to discipline them by controlling our physical appetites. May I suggest that following a daily regimen that includes sufficient sleep, exercise, a healthy diet, and staying clean and well-groomed can in itself contribute to the development of character? Keeping up such discipline can present a challenge to busy students--or anyone else. Faced with homework, tests, and other responsibilities, it is easy to excuse ourselves for lapses in a healthy routine by insisting we are just too busy. But if we persist in such an unwise course for very long, we find ourselves fatigued, sick, or depressed, unable to accomplish the physical and mental work we need to do.<br><br>Remember the remarkable promise given at the end of the Word of Wisdom:<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–20]<br><br>Notice that treasures of wisdom and knowledge are promised to those who heed the commandments and the laws of physical health. As President Packer said, "Your body really<i>is</i>the instrument of your mind."<br><h2><b>A "Spiritually Strengthening" and "Intellectually Enlarging" Education</b></h2><br>I want to speak about the first and second aims of a BYU education--to "be spiritually strengthening" and "intellectually enlarging"--together. As far as I can tell, when these two activities are correctly understood, you can't do one without the other. I have heard some people speak of the intellect and the spirit as if they were diametrically opposed, warning that those who engage deeply in intellectual pursuits will lose their testimonies. However, sociologists who have studied members of our Church have concluded the opposite: higher levels of education are strongly correlated with indicators of faithfulness, such as prayer and scripture study, tithing, missionary service, and temple marriage (see Stan L. Albrecht and Tim B. Heaton, "Secularization, Higher Education, and Religiosity," in<i>Review of Religious Research</i>26, no. 1 [September 1984]: 43–58). This is not to say that one must have diplomas and degrees to be a stalwart member of the Church. Some of the greatest spiritual giants in my life had little formal education. But I propose that those who have attained a high degree of spirituality are also those whose minds are most alive to the wonders of creation and the noblest achievements of the human race. I submit that intellectual and spiritual pursuits not only<i>can</i>but<i>should</i>be harmonized so that the most effective learning will take place, as well as the learning that will most contribute to our spiritual safety.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the intellect; and that the nearer</i>[a]<i>man approaches perfection, the clearer are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>51]<br><br>This statement suggests that the intellect and the spirit are developed simultaneously and that the greater one grows in spiritual stature, the greater one will grow in intellectual ability as well. Brigham Young described the scope of our religion thus: "It matters not what the subject be, if it tends to improve the mind, exalt the feelings, and enlarge the capacity. The truth that is in all the arts and sciences forms a part of our religion" (<i>JD</i>1:335 [5 December 1853]). These familiar verses from the Doctrine and Covenants sum up well the encompassing nature of what the Lord expects us to teach and learn:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]<br><br>This scripture describes well the education we try to give students at BYU. In your religion courses you will be instructed "more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God." I hope you will not be dismayed when your religion professors are more rigorous and demanding than the typical Sunday School teacher. The gospel is a vast topic, and it can't be learned casually. In addition to studying the gospel, this scripture implies we should study everything from astronomy to zoology--every field of learning that belongs to this earth.<br><br>We often stop quoting the verses from section 88 at this point, but let us read the next verse, which explains<i>why</i>we should learn about so many things:<br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I</i>[the Lord]<i>shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:80]<br><br>This scripture states quite simply that the education we gain in the gospel and other fields is to prepare us for the callings that the Lord will give us. I think we could do no better than to look at the current leaders of the Church to see excellent examples of people who magnify their callings precisely because they blend profound knowledge and testimonies of the gospel with broad learning and experience in various professions. For example, President Hinckley's experience with and understanding of the mass media have enabled him to represent the Church in a positive light to millions who are not members. I could multiply examples, but the point is clear: the Lord and His Church need people who have both spiritual understanding and excellent educational preparation. We don't know what callings may yet come to us, but we should consider every subject we study as part of our preparation.<br><br>Thus it is important to approach our studies with an inquiring and enthusiastic attitude. Occasionally students will ask why so many courses are required in general education. Some have even seriously suggested that if they already know what they want to major in, they shouldn't be required to take general education. Allow me to let Albert Einstein and then Brigham Young respond to that argument. When Benjamin Fine of the<i>New York Times</i>interviewed Einstein in 1952, Einstein said:<br><br><i>It is not enough to teach man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine, but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good.</i><br><br><i>Otherwise he--with his specialized knowledge--more closely resembles a well-trained dog....</i><br><br><i>Overemphasis on the competitive system and premature specialization on the ground of immediate usefulness kill the spirit on which all cultural life depends, specialized knowledge included.</i>[Albert Einstein, in Benjamin Fine, "Einstein Stresses Critical Thinking,"<i>New York Times,</i>5 October 1952, News section, 37; also included as "Education for Independent Thought" in Albert Einstein,<i>Ideas and Opinions,</i>ed. Carl Seelig, trans. and rev. Sonja Bargmann (New York: Bonanza Books, 1954), 66–67]<br><br>Now let us see what Brigham Young had to say on this topic:<br><br><i>Let us not narrow ourselves up; for the world, with all its variety of useful information and its rich hoard of hidden treasure, is before us; and eternity, with all its sparkling intelligence, lofty aspirations, and unspeakable glories, is before us, and ready to aid us in the scale of advancement and every useful improvement.</i>[Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>8:9 (4 March 1860)]<br><br>Can we imagine that Jesus, the Creator of this earth and everything in it, lacked any kind of knowledge as He prepared to fulfill the assignment His Father gave Him to "go down" and "make an earth whereon [we might] dwell" (Abraham 3:24)? I urge you to give serious effort to your general education courses. Rather than think of them as something to "get out of the way," think of them as a way of becoming more like the Savior and of seeing His hand in all creation.<br><br>It has been said that major education prepares you to make a living, but general education prepares you to make a life. You will succeed more in your chosen profession if you are broadly educated because you will be more versatile and more able to see how details relate to each other and create the big picture. Your employer will find this a valuable trait and will be able to entrust you with more responsibilities as you gain experience in the workplace. Furthermore, your leisure time will be spent in a more ennobling way if you learn to appreciate good art, music, literature, drama, dance, and film than if you succumb to consuming most of the entertainments that popular culture offers you. So much of it is unworthy of your time, attention, and money.<br><br>I hope you will approach your studies with the attitude demonstrated 20-some years ago by a young man on this campus who was chosen to be a Rhodes scholar--a rare achievement. When he won that honor, the campus newspaper published an interview in which he said that as he approached the library to study, he felt much the same way as when he approached church on Sundays to attend his meetings. Both study and worship were for him a time of spiritual edification. I commend that approach to you.<br><br>This young man was an example of what Elder Neal A. Maxwell has called the "disciple-scholar":<br><br><i>For a disciple of Jesus Christ, academic scholarship is a form of worship. It is actually another dimension of consecration. Hence one who seeks to be a disciple-scholar will take both scholarship and discipleship seriously; and, likewise, gospel covenants. For the disciple-scholar, the first and second great commandments frame and prioritize life. How else could one worship God with all of one's heart, might,</i>mind,<i>and strength? (Luke 10:27.) ...</i><br><br><i>... Consecrated scholarship thus converges the life both of the mind and of the spirit!</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "The Disciple-Scholar," in<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar,</i>ed. Henry B. Eyring (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995), 7, 8; emphasis in original]<br><br>However, Elder Maxwell qualifies his urging that we worship God with our minds through scholarship. The first qualification is that "there is no democracy among truths. They are not of equal significance" (Maxwell,<i>On Becoming,</i>3). The revealed truths of the gospel<i>are</i>more important and<i>do</i>take precedence over the truths that have been forged out of the collective efforts of human beings. It is good to know both, but if we must on occasion choose where to put our allegiance, we should choose the revealed truths of the gospel. The second qualification Elder Maxwell offers is this: "Genius without meekness is not enough to qualify for discipleship" (Maxwell,<i>On Becoming,</i>14). The disciple-scholar blends intellectual traits with spiritual ones that often seem their opposite. Such a person tempers curiosity with obedience; questioning with submissiveness; zeal for knowledge with faith and humility; and striving to excel with brotherly kindness. Perhaps this is part of what is meant by the encouragement to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).<br><br>I recall a time when I was in a BYU ward where one of the bishop's counselors was an undergraduate student with what I judged to be fairly ordinary intellectual talents. But he had extraordinary faith and a desire to obey. In a sacrament meeting he told of an experience he had had the previous week. With a deadline for a paper looming before him, he was hard at work writing one afternoon when a knock came at the door. A member of the ward needed his help. This young counselor knew that if he took the time to serve, he would be hard-pressed to finish his paper and do a good job on it. But he chose to serve. He came back to his paper with the deadline now only hours away. He told us he knelt and asked his Heavenly Father to let words flow into his mind. When he went back to work, his prayer was answered in just the way he had asked. Words flowed into his mind, and he was able to complete his assignment on time. He learned not only by study by also by faith.<br><br>Such dramatic experiences may not come to you. But I believe all can have experiences such as I had one Saturday afternoon in graduate school. I was wrestling with the homework in a course requiring a knowledge of statistics I lacked. As I grew more and more frustrated, I was tempted to just give up and take a zero on the assignment, knowing it would mean I would do poorly on the next test as well. But instead I prayed, and there came to me a feeling of calm and confidence that I could do this. As I went back to the homework with more faith, I found that I could figure it out, and I was able to do the assignment and pass the test.<br><br>This principle that faith contributes to learning is reinforced in Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>Notice that two ways in which we gain knowledge and intelligence are diligence and obedience. Some things we cannot learn through intellectual efforts alone. How can we know that the windows of heaven will open for us unless we tithe? How can we know the blessings of Sabbath observance unless we keep the Sabbath holy? If we are diligent and not hit-and-miss in our obedience, we will know things in a way we could never know by study alone. Let us remember the counsel of Nephi: "To be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29). Such hearkening will increase our knowledge and enlarge our intellectual aptitude.<br><br>Finally, let us follow the counsel given by our beloved prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, when he was a member of the Twelve nearly 40 years ago. Speaking of the Savior's invitation to "learn of me," President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>With all of your learning, learn of him. With all of your study, seek knowledge of the Master. That knowledge will complement in a wonderful way the secular training you receive and give a fulness to your life and character that can come in no other way.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>CR,</i>October 1964, 118; see also "With All Thy Getting Get Understanding,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1988, 5]<br><h2><b>Preparing for "Lifelong Learning and Service"</b></h2><br>The fourth aim of a BYU education is to prepare you for "lifelong learning and service." As I stated earlier, it is not to prepare you to earn a lot of money. Nevertheless, statistics show that, on average, those with college degrees earn significantly more than those with less education (see National Center for Education Statistics, available from http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=77). Thus most of you will become comparatively wealthy simply as a byproduct of earning a degree. Notice I said "comparatively wealthy"--and the comparison group is much of the population in the rest of the world.<br><br>On a National Public Radio program I heard recently, it was said that one billion people on this earth live on one dollar a day, and another two billion people live on two dollars a day (Lisa Simeone, "African Hunger,"<i>Weekend All Things Considered,</i>NPR broadcast, 24 June 2001). Think of those figures as you listen to these statistics I gleaned recently from the newspaper: Almost $7 billion was spent in the United States last year on cosmetics alone (Anna Quindlen, "While Obsessing Over Our Bodies, Have We Lost Our Minds?"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>18 April 2001, A19). Some $13 billion was spent on chocolate (Sudarsan Raghavan and Sumana Chatterjee, "Child Slavery Taints Global Chocolate Industries,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>1 July 2001, A9). Another $7 billion was spent on "videotape rentals, $20 billion at jewelry stores, and $24 billion at liquor stores" (Spirituality and Ethics, Shelvia Dancy, "If They Wanted, Americans Could Feed Half the World's Starving People,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>, 14 April 2001, C1). Altogether those sums total $71 billion. Meanwhile, an organization called the Bread for the World Institute estimates that it would take only about $1 billion a year from the U.S. over the next 15 years to subtract "512 million people from among the estimated 800 million people worldwide who suffer from hunger" (Dancy, "If They Wanted," C1). These figures challenge us all to consider whether we have the right priorities for using our means.<br><br>Those who are privileged to "enter to learn" at BYU have an obligation to then "go forth to serve." Let me read to you from the aims document:<br><br><i>Since a decreasing fraction of the Church membership can be admitted to study at BYU, it is ever more important that those who are admitted use their talents to build the kingdom of God on the earth. ... Students should learn, then demonstrate, that their ultimate allegiance is to higher values, principles, and human commitments rather than to mere self-interest. By doing this, BYU graduates can counter the destructive and often materialistic self-centeredness and worldliness that afflict modern society. A service ethic should permeate every part of BYU's activities--from the admissions process through the curriculum and extracurricular experiences to the moment of graduation. This ethic should also permeate each student's heart, leading him or her to the ultimate wellspring of charity--the love for others that Christ bestows on His followers.</i>[<i>Mission and Aims,</i>13]<br><br>The pure love of Christ will fill our hearts as we serve the less fortunate. The self-centeredness of those who ignore the poor and the needy is well-depicted in a mural painted by the great Latter-day Saint artist Minerva Teichert on a wall of the world room in the Manti Temple. Some of the murals in this room show the grand march of gentile history from the Tower of Babel to the sailing of Columbus. In one mural, against the backdrop of a great and spacious building, are a number of colorful, brightly lit figures who represent the wealthy, powerful, learned, and successful people of the world--those who have made things happen and have left their mark. In contrast to these grand figures are a number of darker figures in the foreground that one almost doesn't notice at first. They represent a variety of people in need: a homeless family; a mother and her lame son; a crippled soldier who has lost a leg in battle; a woman holding the limp body of her child in her arms; another woman clutching her head in despair; and a family of immigrants driven by oppression to seek a new life in an unseen land. (I am grateful to my colleague Doris Dant for illuminating my understanding of these murals through her article "Minerva Teichert's Manti Temple Murals," published in<i>BYU Studies</i>38, no. 3 [1999]: 6–44.) Surveying this mural, one realizes with shock that the rich and powerful don't even glance at the poor and needy on the margins of their worldly parade. Perhaps these words from Jacob explain how this could happen: "Because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god" (2 Nephi 9:30).<br><br>We know that riches are not in themselves bad; rather, it is the way we use riches that leads either to approbation or condemnation. We learn also from Jacob that if we seek first for the kingdom of God and obtain a hope in Christ, we "shall obtain riches, if [we] seek them." But he adds a powerful caution: We should seek them "for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted" (Jacob 2:18–19). As with riches, fame is not necessarily bad--if it comes from doing something good. Certainly we are grateful to know the story of Columbus, whose voyage prepared the way for a new nation where freedom would flourish and the gospel could be restored. A deed like his is worthy of mention in the world's history. But remember that one can also do important service that likely won't be recorded by historians. These words from the closing lines of George Eliot's<i>Middlemarch</i>express an important truth:<br><br><i>The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.</i>[George Eliot,<i>Middlemarch</i>(Ware, Hertfordshire, UK: Wordsworth Editions Ltd., 1994), 781]<br><br>Whether you serve in relative obscurity as a parent or a Primary teacher, or whether you serve in the limelight as a government official or a prominent Church leader, your service is significant to its beneficiaries, and it is known to the Lord.<br><br>I know that you students have already begun to give significant service, which has been considered in the decision to admit you to the university. Let me suggest some ways that you can continue to serve. One is to accept callings and assignments in your ward and stake. Another is to take a service-learning course. The Jacobsen Center for Service and Learning on this campus helps teachers make service an integral part of the curriculum in many courses, and it keeps track of service opportunities for which students may volunteer outside of class. The David M. Kennedy Center has several international study programs that make service in a foreign land a meaningful part of the time students spend abroad. But you don't need to travel abroad or even to turn to an organized center to find opportunities to serve. They are all around you in your family, your ward, your apartment or residence hall, and in the community.<br><br>One of the joys of my current assignment is to review portfolios of students who are applying to graduate with University Honors. Among other things, these portfolios contain a description of a memorable service activity that each student has engaged in. As I have read these descriptions, I have sometimes been humbled to tears by the quality and quantity of the service rendered. Keep in mind that students who want to graduate with honors must also keep a high GPA as well as do original research and write a thesis while taking a regular load of courses, so finding time for significant service requires great discipline and sacrifice on their part. Yet they do it willingly, and they write of tutoring children with developmental disabilities or helping those with physical handicaps or of giving health care or helping to build schools or sanitation facilities in less-developed nations. Often the honors thesis itself represents research that has blessed or will bless the lives of others. You don't have to be an honors student to serve others or to do research that may benefit others; nevertheless, the Honors Program is open to all, and many of you freshmen may want to investigate joining. Regardless, you will find your learning and service here to be just as perfunctory or just as enriching as you decide to make them.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The four aims together "aspire to promote an education that helps students integrate all parts of their university experience into a fundamentally sacred way of life" (<i>Mission of BYU,</i>14). No other university I know of (except our sister campuses in Hawaii and Idaho) aspires to such a lofty goal. Because of the seriousness of what we are about, some of you may be thinking that life at BYU will be a cross between boot camp and a never-ending church meeting. You may be asking yourselves, "Isn't there going to be any fun here?" The answer, of course, is yes. You will find plenty of fun--in adventures with roommates and friends; activities in your ward and residence halls; at sporting events, concerts, and dances; and, occasionally, even in the classroom. I don't need to wish for you that you will have fun. It will happen.<br><br>But I do wish for you that when you look back years from now, you will see that your college years were much more than fun. I wish for you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you honored commitments, treated friends and associates in a Christlike way, and increased in self-discipline and integrity. I hope you will feel a humble gratitude from knowing that you dedicated--even consecrated--yourself to improving your intellectual talents and increasing your spirituality. I pray that because you have tasted the joy that comes from service, you will seek to serve continually throughout your life. Such a sweet self-assessment can be yours years hence if you do not content yourself now with lounging comfortably at a base camp in the foothills when, with some exertion, you could be standing on the summit of a great mountain.<br><br>President Kimball prophesied that Brigham Young University will one day be an "educational Everest" (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>[Provo: BYU, 1976], 244). President Bateman last fall expressed his belief that BYU will play an important role in the establishment of Zion (see Merrill J. Bateman, "Learning in the Light of Truth," BYU Annual University Conference, 21 August 2000, http://speeches-dev.byu.edu/auc/00AUC_Bateman.pdf). I believe that will happen in large part because the students who come here will rise to the challenge of the four aims and dedicate themselves to becoming a Zion people.<br><br>I express my confidence in you. You are a chosen generation, and the Lord loves you and will bless you in all your righteous endeavors. I leave you my testimony that His church and kingdom have been restored to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that His chosen servant, Gordon B. Hinckley, leads His work on the earth today. I am grateful for that testimony, and I bear it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kristine Hansen was a professor of English and an associate dean of General Education and Honors when this devotional address was given on 3 July 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>s Is Half Full: The Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to be here today among friends, colleagues, and students. As I was seated upon the stand and thinking about what I might say to introduce my topic, it dawned on me how things have really come full circle. It doesn&#39;t seem like it was very long ago when I was in your seats here as a student myself at the university. And, interestingly enough for me personally, I notice seated upon the stand two professors who had a profound impact upon my own education and on what I would eventually do for a living. You have heard from one, Brother Donald Q. Cannon, who gave the opening prayer. He was a very important teacher in my life who directed my attention to the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He encouraged my pursuit of a degree in that field and has been a kind friend, colleague, and important mentor ever since. Also upon the stand is associate academic vice president Noel Reynolds. Professor Reynolds was one of my political science professors. And since that time he has been a good friend and mentor.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about the Second Coming, but I would like to talk specifically about two aspects that I call related but separate issues. The first aspect is the timing of the Second Coming and the second is the emphasis we sometimes place on the prophecies that tend to highlight the terrible days and tribulation that lie ahead for the generation who will witness this long-prophesied event.<br><br>I often come into class the first day wearing sunglasses, so I am going to put on a pair of sunglasses right now to illustrate an important point. This is where we&#39;ll begin today. All of us, whether we know it or not, wear a pair of glasses. The color, the tint of the lens, is determined by our social and academic background, our experience, our ethnicity, our gender, and also our religious convictions. Sometimes we go a long time without having our eyes checked, and therefore we wear glasses from an old prescription. So not only do we have a tint of color in our glasses, but sometimes the glasses are out of focus. I remember one difficult year during graduate school. You can imagine starting a family while in a PhD program and living on a shoestring budget. I broke a pair of glasses and decided that I couldn&#39;t afford a new pair. So I went for about six months before I finally went to the optometrist and got a new prescription and a new pair of glasses. When I came out of his office, I literally stood on the sidewalk disoriented as I attempted to focus. And I said to myself, "Boy, I forgot that blades of grass can actually be discerned." In six months my eyes had changed tremendously.<br><br>When we worship together on Sunday; go to the temple; attend classes here at BYU in the sciences, humanities, mathematics, arts, religion, and all other fields; attend general conference; and receive blessings and counsel from our friends, part of the purpose in these endeavors is to get a better prescription--that is, to try to get a better pair of glasses and eliminate the artificial color and blurring of our vision. Changing our glasses can affect the way we see the world. And so today I would ask all of us to take off our glasses--the way we generally look at the Second Coming--and try to look through a new pair of lenses, which, I pray, will give us a better understanding.<br><br>Paul the Apostle put it another way: "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Although the modern reader of the King James Version may not quite get the proper reading of the text from the language of 1611, we generally understand what he is saying. Let me restate the quote in modern phrasing: "During mortality," Paul would say, "we look into an bronze mirror and see ourselves as a reversed and distorted image. Someday, however, we will see a perfect view of ourselves and the world, not reversed like a mirror and not distorted like an ancient bronze mirror."<br><h2><b>The Timing of the Second Coming</b></h2><br>It has not been unusual for nearly every generation who has lived on the earth since the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ to believe they might witness the terrible events immediately preceding the Second Coming and be present at His coming. Apparently even some first-century Saints thought they lived in the "last days"; they believed His coming was imminent. You will recall Paul&#39;s famous admonition to the members of the Church in Thessalonica:<br><br><i>Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</i><br><br><i>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</i>[2 Thessalonians 2:1–2]<br><br>For this group, anxious about the event, Paul provided a list of some of the key events that must occur<i>before</i>the Lord&#39;s second advent. In other words, he exhorted them to be patient and not to be troubled about the timing of the Second Coming.<br><br>Later generations were also anxious. In particular, some Christians greeted the turn of the first millennium after Christ with the belief that the end of the world was at hand. There were even some who sold all their possessions, dressed in white clothing, and waited in a prayerful attitude in fields outside their cities as the church bells tolled the dawn of a new millennium.<br><br>Through more than 25 years of personal study--beginning during my undergraduate training here at BYU and continuing on through graduate school and the present--I have come to realize that even during our glorious dispensation of the fulness of times, many Latter-day Saints believe they might witness the Second Coming. For example, some Saints living in the 1860s believed that the great American Civil War was the beginning of the end. Another group of Saints thought that 1890 would be a decisive year, and still another generation of members of the Church were sure that the Great War that we now call World War I was the foretold destruction that would immediately precede the coming of Christ. Some of my parents&#39; generation, the so-called "Greatest Generation," believed that World War II was nothing more nor less than the beginning of the destruction that would be poured out upon all nations before the Second Coming and of almost every major conflict or development in the Middle East. From my personal observation today, nothing has really changed since the days of Paul: for generation after generation some people have become anxious about the timing of the Second Coming and have misread many of the prophecies found in sacred scriptures.<br><br>The proliferation of popular books, tapes, and firesides among the Latter-day Saints during the last 25 years of my adult experience demonstrates how fruitful our imaginations have been when we have attempted to interpret current affairs in light of ancient and modern prophecy without proper historical context and the prophetic and ordained authority to do so.<br><br>The Internet brought a whole new way to stir the waters. Rumors abound about a friend whose uncle knew a woman who worked in the temple who had met a young missionary who was told by his patriarch that the elder would not finish his mission before the Second Coming! Certainly the Internet has blessed our lives, but what a curse it has been as far as rumormongering is concerned--even among Latter-day Saints.<br><br>My generation was not immune either from the effects of what I call Second-Coming fever. As young missionaries, some of us serving in the Italy Milan Mission speculated that 1974 would be a critical year--and possibly the very year of the Second Coming. We were highly imaginative as we wove together a tapestry of various bits of data, including the facts that the April annual general conference that year was to be the 144th annual conference of the Church and President Spencer W. Kimball, the twelfth president of the Church, would be sustained as prophet, seer, and revelator in a special solemn assembly to be held on April 6. What better day than this, a day filled with historical tradition and scripturally significant numbers such as 12 and 144, for the Lord to return to earth to begin His millennial reign? You may laugh, but we took our wild speculation very seriously. Of course that historic and spiritually uplifting conference has come and gone, and we are still here. (See<i>CR,</i>April 1974, or<i>Ensign,</i>May 1974.)<br><br>Even today I encounter scores of people who believe they will witness the Second Coming in their lifetime. For my part, I am now somewhat reserved and wiser. I teach my students these guiding principles: prepare a will, buy life insurance, put funds away in a retirement program, and, if they really want to be nice to their family, purchase a pre-need funeral program that includes a cemetery plot! For many of my students, this last bit of advice is a little morbid, but it makes my point. Live today as if you will meet Jesus this evening, but plan your life as though you will live to be 100 years old.<br><br>A bright friend of mine always dreamed of becoming a medical doctor. However, during our undergraduate training here at BYU he fell prey to Second-Coming fever and made a decision in his life not to continue his education and apply to medical school. He reasoned that if the Second Coming was close, then he probably wouldn&#39;t even have time to finish paying off his college loans, and in the Millennium he wouldn&#39;t even have a job! Needless to say, my dear friend made a terrible mistake on two accounts. First, he was wrong to believe that the day Paul had talked about was upon us:<br><br><i>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</i><br><br><i>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</i>[1 Thessalonians 4:16–18]<br><br>Second--and this may be a more important point for you and me today--my friend did not realize that the Lord expects us to live for the future no matter what lies on the horizon. One of the best examples of this principle is the story of the Saints&#39; efforts to build the beautiful Nauvoo Temple on the banks of the Mississippi River in Illinois more than 100 years ago. They knew that they were leaving for a great journey to a new land far away in the west, yet they built the temple anyway. They not only built it so they could receive sacred ordinances, but they built it as though it would stand for decades to come. We need to plan for tomorrow, no matter what comes today.<br><br>This is continually reinforced to me as students who seem to be overly concerned about the timing of the Second Coming sincerely ask, "Why should we plan for the future?" "Why should we finish our college education?" "Why should we have children when events so awful are about to descend upon us that just the thought of them can make even the most callous of us have an upset stomach?" There never seems to be a week following a news broadcast about the events in or connected to the Middle East that someone does not ask me, "Well, Brother Holzapfel, is this it?"<br><br>Let me read a quote that sums it up well:<br><br><i>I recall a reported statement, attributed, as I remember it, to President Wilford Woodruff. Some of the brethren of his time are said to have approached him (they had their troubles also) and to have inquired of him as to when he felt the end would be--when would be the coming of the Master? These, I think, are not his exact words, but they convey the spirit of his reported reply: "I would live as if it were to be tomorrow--but I am still planting cherry trees!" I think we may well take this as a page for our own book and live as if the end might be tomorrow--and still plant cherry trees!</i>[Richard L. Evans,<i>CR,</i>April 1950, 105–6]<br><br>Although I certainly do not know the day nor the hour of the coming of our Lord--as Jesus said Himself, no one knows that but the Father (see Matthew 24:36)--I have learned to be careful in speculating about events associated with the Lord&#39;s glorious return. We should not be so myopic and consider ourselves the focus of history. Additionally, I try to take into account all the prophecies of the last days instead of focusing on a few isolated passages and ignoring a host of others that provide a broader context of the last days. Certainly there is a lot of work yet to do, so I am not overly anxious about the timing of the coming of the Lord.<br><h2><b>Hope in Our Day and in the Future</b></h2><br>Another aspect related to the Second Coming is the pessimism often associated with the events immediately preceding the coming of the Lord.<br><br>According to one dictionary,<i>pessimism</i>is "an inclination to take the least favorable view (as of events) or to expect the worst" (<i>Merriam-Webster Dictionary,</i>paperback ed., s.v. "pessimism," 1997, 549). In popular speech, one who is pessimistic is one who sees the proverbial glass as being half empty. During my life I have encountered students, friends, and associates who have often shown various degrees of pessimism when discussing the Second Coming.<br><br>In fact, an entry in the<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>noted this:<br><br><i>In Jewish and Christian thought there are two basic ways of viewing the coming of the Messiah. Some consider promises of a Messiah and a millennial era symbolic of a time when men</i>[and women]<i>will finally learn to live in peace and harmony and the world will enter a new age of enlightenment and progress; no one individual nor any one specific event will usher in this age. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opposes this view and agrees with the many other Jewish and Christian groups who affirm that there is an actual Messiah, that he will come at some future time to the earth, and that only through his coming and the events associated therewith will a millennial age of peace, harmony, and joy begin.</i>[Daniel H. Ludlow, ed.,<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism: The History, Scripture, Doctrine, and Procedure of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1992), s.v. "Jesus Christ: Second Coming," 2:737–38]<br><br>The author continues:<br><br><i>The scriptures, both biblical and modern, abundantly testify that the era just preceding the second advent of the Savior will be "perilous" (2 Tim. 3:1) and filled with "tribulation" (Matt. 24:29). At that time "the devil shall have power over his own dominion" (D&amp;amp;C 1:35). The resulting judgments upon the wicked are part of the preparations for the Millennium.</i>[<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>738]<br><br>Although this description in the<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>is certainly accurate in placing our doctrine of the Second Coming in context with what other Jews and Christians think about the coming of the Messiah, such a view without the proper context often provides fertile ground for a growing pessimism regarding the time in which we live and the future.<br><br>I am no Pollyanna. I know something has gone terribly wrong with our planet, and I believe that the only ultimate hope for humankind is Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, I believe we need to be optimistic about the present and what lies beyond the horizon. A bright future still awaits all of us as we approach the Second Coming. Remember our earlier quote from Paul found in 1 Thessalonians? "Wherefore comfort one another with these words" (1 Thessalonians 4:18). The Lord certainly expects that the proper teaching about events surrounding the Second Coming should provide comfort to us.<br><br>I have fallen prey to this pessimism from time to time and have wondered whether the future holds any real promises in light of prophetic scriptures about "the great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Malachi 4:5).<br><br>I am almost certain we could fill one of the largest lecture halls here on campus if we chose a speaker willing to focus on the blood, fire, carcasses, flies, immorality, wickedness, natural and political upheavals of the time, and, finally, the death and destruction usually associated with Second Coming discussions. I am also certain that if we had someone address the basic doctrines of Christ--such as faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost--we most likely would have a rather small showing in the lecture hall. The Second Coming is an exciting topic, with sex, violence, and intrigue all part of the main story line.<br><br>My generation and the one that has followed--your generation--I call "the Fast-Food Generations." We need stimulation about every two minutes or we lose interest. (I believe that is about the pace of<i>Sesame Street.</i>) So the exciting and highly violent nature of certain prophecies regarding the Second Coming tends to capture our imagination, whereas other topics seem boring. Speakers and teachers who desperately want to keep the attention of their students often resort to Second Coming themes as a way to hold their audience. In this I believe we do ourselves a great disservice.<br><br>In the past I have focused on the "blood-and-gore" prophecies and provided my own students a glass that is half empty. I am sorry for those failings and apologize to my students for providing an environment of anxiety, fear, and stress.<br><br>The scriptures, however, offer another view of the events of the last days. Let me provide you with an example of how just one text can be read through different lenses--how one can view the glass as being half empty or how one can view the glass as being half full.<br><br>I am not sure how many times I have read Nephi&#39;s words describing his vision concerning the last days, but they are legion. Nephi stated: "And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters" (1 Nephi 14:12).<br><br>My good friend and colleague Stephen E. Robinson recently provided a thoughtful insight to this passage as it relates to the identity of the "great and abominable church" mentioned by Nephi (see Stephen E. Robinson, "Nephi&#39;s &#39;Great and Abominable Church,&#39;"<i>Journal of Book of Mormon Studies</i>7, no. 1 [1998]: 32–39, 70). I, however, want to pay close attention to this comment from the scriptures: "and its numbers were few." In seeing the glass as half empty, I have tended to emphasize the negative aspects of our times: The Church is small because there are so many ungodly people doing ungodly things--and things will only get worse.<br><br>It may be difficult for some students here today to visualize a church of only two million members, yet I vividly recall that day not too far in our past. The Church membership has certainly grown beyond my wildest imaginations, and I have had to readjust my thinking on this topic. What does it mean to be small? To get a sense of my own experience, one needs to look no further than a wonderful article written by BYU professor Bruce A. Van Orden in the October 1999 issue of the<i>Ensign,</i>"Preparing for a Worldwide Ministry" (pages 32–46). Bruce, who is just a few years older than myself, tells the dramatic story of the Church&#39;s growth during the period between 1951 and 1995 from his own perspective as a witness who has lived during these times.<br><br>Even today maybe some of you think a church of 15 to 20 million could fulfill Nephi&#39;s vision of "the church of the Lamb of God" as being composed of a few members in comparison with the total world population.<br><br>Now let us reread the text. Instead of seeing the glass as half empty, let us see it as half full: "And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters;<i>nevertheless,</i>I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth" (1 Nephi 14:12; emphasis added).<br><br>Notice the wording: "nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth."<br><br>Now that provides a whole new way of looking at things. Relatively speaking, the membership of the Church could be considered small with 100, 250, or even 600 million members when compared with the world population. The key to interpreting this verse may well be exploring it with the idea that the Church&#39;s membership will be "upon<i>all</i>the face of the earth" (emphasis added).<br><br>Not long after the Church was organized, the Lord told the Saints: "Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men--Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight" (D&amp;amp;C 65:1). This revelation was received sometime in October 1831 on the Johnson family farm in rural Ohio. Although we do not know the exact number of members in the Church at the time, it was certainly not more than six thousand--and it was probably closer to two to three thousand. Yet the Lord told this small group of Saints that His "going forth is unto the ends of the earth." He was trying to prepare them for the mission ahead of them. A few weeks later, in a revelation now found in the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, He was more exact:<br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men</i>[and women],<i>and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated....</i><br><br><i>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</i><br><br><i>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:2, 4–5]<br><br>It seems reasonable to suppose that the Lord has a much larger plan than we sometimes see. Because we tend to be myopic when it comes to God&#39;s continued and deep abiding love for others, we subconsciously assume that He has saved us and that is all that really matters. Let us return for a moment to the October 1831 revelation in Doctrine and Covenants 65. Following a brief but powerful introduction, the Lord says something quite marvelous:<br><br><i>The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 65:2]<br><br>Of course the imagery here is based on the ancient prophecy found in the Old Testament. Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream of a colossal image was revealed to Daniel:<br><br><i>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</i><br><br><i>This image&#39;s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</i><br><br><i>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</i><br><br><i>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</i><br><br><i>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</i>[Daniel 2:31–35]<br><br>Not only did Lord reveal to Daniel the dream of the king, but He also provided through Daniel the interpretation thereof (see Daniel 2:36–45). In the last two verses of this interpretation, Daniel said:<br><br><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</i><br><br><i>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</i>[Daniel 2:44–45]<br><br>Since 1831, when section 65 of the Doctrine and Covenants was received, some members of the Church have continually struggled to capture the large vision of the kingdom&#39;s destiny. An example of this is found in a story Wilford Woodruff related about the earliest days of the Church:<br><br><i>On Sunday night the Prophet called on all who held the Priesthood to gather into the little log school house they had there. It was a small house, perhaps 14 feet square. But it held the whole of the Priesthood of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who were then in the town of Kirtland. ... When we got together the Prophet called upon the Elders of Israel with him to bear testimony of this work. ... When they got through</i>[bearing testimonies]<i>the Prophet said, "Brethren I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother&#39;s lap. You don&#39;t comprehend it." I was rather surprised. He said, "It is only a little handfull of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world."</i>[Wilford Woodruff,<i>CR,</i>April 1898, 57]<br><br>It may be that some of us are still like these early Saints--we know no more concerning the destiny of the Lord&#39;s church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother&#39;s lap. We don&#39;t comprehend it. I certainly do not, but I am beginning to get the picture. I started to expand my vision when I was a young missionary serving in Italian-speaking Switzerland and in northern Italy. The food in Italy was wonderful, but the work was difficult, and rejection was common. Certainly larger numbers of people were joining the Church in Italy at the time in comparison to some other European countries, but it was not uncommon for missionaries to labor months upon months without witnessing the marvelous miracle of conversion. I was very pessimistic about the Church&#39;s future in Italy. I knew, of course, of the phenomenal success of the Church in Mexico and in Central and South America, but I was deeply concerned about Europe. At the time the Eastern Bloc--the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries--was closed to active missionary efforts.<br><br>In my lifetime I never imagined that China, Africa, and Greece would ever have congregations of Saints worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, ironically, we still believed that the Second Coming was imminent. We simply did not comprehend the Lord&#39;s timetable in this matter or the scope of His intended work during the time preceding the Second Coming.<br><br>Sometimes, in rather dramatic fashion, things change. The revelation on priesthood in 1978 and the demise of the Soviet Union dramatically changed the boundaries of our missionary fields of labor. Who has not been grateful for the expansion of the work among our brothers and sisters across Africa, eastern Europe, and elsewhere? Thrilling stories of a new generation of Mormon pioneers living in such places as Mongolia and India and in nations unfamiliar to myself such as the island chain of Kiribati are just as spiritually exciting and stimulating as almost any story from the first 100 years of the Restoration.<br><br>In 1997 I began a year of service at the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. During the following year we met with members of the Church from various nations of the earth and from various ethnicities living, working, and worshiping in the Holy Land. A real surprise to me was a branch composed of native members of the Church in Jordan and Israel--some returned missionaries and endowed in the temple. Since then, along with other professors--David Seely, Jim Toronto, and Paul Hoskisson--I have spoken to members of the Church who gather together weekly to worship the Lord in Lebanon and Cyprus.<br><br>It was in Cyprus that my story comes full circle. One of my assignments during my mission was in Lugano, a beautiful city by a lake in the mountains of southern Switzerland. It was a paradise: Swiss yogurt, Swiss chocolate, and heated buses in the winter! While there I became friends with Trafford and Fernanda Cole, members who lived in Italy. My companion, Elder Chris Meacham, and I spent long hours with them when they visited Lugano. Nearly a year later I was transferred to Padova, Italy, near Venice. There my companion Elder Steve Smoot and I worked closely with the Coles. Young and enthusiastic about the gospel, they both played important roles in the small branch of the Church. If they were ever pessimistic about the Church&#39;s future in Italy, they never showed it.<br><br>Recently, some 25 years later, I rushed to a small, rented hall in Cyprus where Professor Seely and I were to speak at a missionary fireside. The missionaries had placed an ad in the local paper announcing the meeting: "Two American University Professors Will Speak on Paul&#39;s Life and Labors." Paul had visited the island nearly 2,000 years ago, and now we were there to talk to members and nonmembers of the Church about his life and ministry.<br><br>As we made our way into the building, we were introduced to some of the local members, visitors, guests, and missionaries serving on the island. I was impressed with the group of young elders and sisters. They were assigned to the Athens Greece Mission and were serving at this time on the island of Cyprus. They came from many lands, including Canada, England, Sweden, Germany, and France. But as the group opened up, there he was: Elder Cole. Yes, it was the son of Trafford and Fernanda Cole--the young couple I had known previously in Italy. Elder Cole was a second-generation Italian speaking modern Greek as a Latter-day Saint missionary in Cyprus!<br><br>Of course my story can be duplicated dozens of times by many of you here today. My students are returned missionaries from California, Montana, Chile, France, Russia, Mongolia, India, Korea, etcetera. My colleagues serve as mission presidents throughout the world--in places that seemed closed forever but that have now been opened by the hand of the Lord. The gospel is spreading across the nations of the earth. Although we are relatively few in number, nevertheless the destiny of this Church is such that before the Lord&#39;s coming there shall be Saints upon<i>all</i>the face of the earth.<br><br>In addition I have come to appreciate the fact that people of goodwill from various nations and various religious traditions can and do make a difference in the world today. We must see these people as allies and friends, working together to fulfill God&#39;s plan of a just and safe world for men and women, young and old, rich and poor, black and white, and educated and noneducated. Surely there are many good people to be found on the earth--not just among the Latter-day Saints. We are not alone, and the numbers of good, honest people will increase upon the earth.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>There is another important scripture that I believe will help us see the glass of the future as half full instead of half empty. It is found in the book of Revelation, chapter 7. John saw those who will be saved in heaven and observed, "And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel" (Revelation 7:4).<br><br>But that is not all who are saved, as verse 9 continues: "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands" (Revelation 7:9).<br><br>How does my understanding of the gospel help me to appreciate this scripture? Well, I know that men and women become kings and priests, queens and priestesses through the ordinances of the house of the Lord. If we take this passage literally--and I certainly do--then the restored gospel of Jesus Christ must spread to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and those people who accept the gospel must be baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enter into the temples of the Lord to receive all the ordinances therein that allow them to receive the fulness of the priesthood. Have you and I not witnessed the expansion of temple building in our own time to match the internationalization of the Church?<br><br>There is a sense that we are just beginning this aspect of the work, especially when listening to President Gordon B. Hinckley in the April 2001 general conference. He said:<br><br><i>The great work of temple building goes on throughout the world. ... It is wonderful, but we are not satisfied. We will keep on working to bring the temples to the people....</i><br><br><i>I have said before that the blessings of the temple represent that fulness of the priesthood of which the Lord spoke when He revealed His will unto the Prophet Joseph Smith.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Work Goes On,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 5]<br><br>For those who have been careful to examine ancient and modern prophecy together, instead of isolating certain passages of the scriptures, it does not surprise them that although we are most certainly in the "last days"--noting the official name of the Church--we still have much work to do. President Brigham Young, the founder of this institution, indicated long before any temples were built in Utah that "to accomplish this work [salvation for the living and the dead] there will have to be not only one temple but thousands of them" (Brigham Young, 22 June 1856,<i>JD</i>3:372).<br><br>We are witnessing the beginning of the fulfillment of Joseph Smith&#39;s vision:<br><br><i>Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and . . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i>[Joseph Smith,<i>HC</i>4:540]<br><br>In our own time President Gordon B. Hinckley declared this is just the beginning:<br><br><i>There was never a brighter day than today in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There was never a season when the work of the Lord prospered as it now prospers.</i><br><br><i>There was never a time for greater rejoicing and gratitude on the part of Latter-day Saints everywhere....</i><br><br><i>. . . I marvel at what is happening in the growth and expansion of this work. And yet I know that what we see today is but the scratching of the surface of far greater things yet to come.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Lengthened Shadow of the Hand of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1987, 52, 59]<br><br>So that I will not be misunderstood, let me say that I am aware of the challenges we face as individuals, as a society, as a nation, and as a Church. Remember Jesus&#39; own words on the night He was betrayed: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). I have witnessed such things in my own family, among my friends, and among the Saints as I have served in various Church callings. In the triumphal vision of John, we are reminded of the difficulties that plague us in mortality. When asked to identify the kings and priests and queens and priestesses from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people that he saw in his vision, John indicated he did not know. Then the angel of the Lord told him: "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:14).<br><br>Certainly we are mortal. We do face challenges. We need to be realistic about the effects of a fallen world; nevertheless, we need to see the glass as being half full. Recalling the words of Elder Neal A. Maxwell might help us put future events in context:<br><br><i>Yes, there will be wrenching polarization on this planet, but also the remarkable reunion with our colleagues in Christ from the city of Enoch. Yes, nation after nation will become a house divided, but more and more unifying Houses of the Lord will grace this planet. Yes, Armageddon lies ahead--but so does Adam-ondi-Ahman!</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Even As I Am</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1982), 121]<br><br>Elder Maxwell added, "His work proceeds forward almost as if in the comparative calmness of the eye of a storm. First, He reigns in the midst of His saints; soon, in all the world" (<i>Even As I Am,</i>121). Truly in Christ Jesus we find hope and pray for His return, when "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes" (Revelation 7:17). I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard Neitzel Holzapfel was a BYU associate professor of Church history and doctrine when this devotional address was given on 10 July 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>and to Be Known of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to David Whitmer, we are told that eternal life "is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7). When we understand that the entire work and glory of the Savior is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39), a most significant question for us is "How do we obtain eternal life?" The Savior provided the key in His great intercessory prayer recorded by John, the beloved apostle: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). The key, then, to eternal life is to know God the Father and Jesus Christ.<br><br>Here at BYU, as at any university, we are engaged in the business of knowing. Our knowledge is tested in exams, papers, laboratories, and applied settings. If you are like me, some of those things we know just long enough to take a test for, and there are other things we know and retain long past any examination.<br><br>I believe that the "knowing" spoken of by the Savior is far above a knowing of facts, techniques, or theories. To know Jesus Christ requires a different kind of knowledge. To gain eternal life we cannot merely be acquainted with Him or recall some factoid about His life as if we were playing a trivia game. We cannot simply read about Him. Knowing Him is more than knowing His doctrine and certainly more than professing His doctrine. The New Testament tells of many who spent time with Jesus, who heard His words and even saw His miracles, but who, sadly, never knew Him. Knowing Him in the way that He has counseled and pled with us to know Him requires everything we are and, in the end, changes our beings forever.<br><br>Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone described the transforming power of knowing Him in this way:<br><br><i>One who truly knows Him does not--nor cannot, nor will not--forget Him, ever. Whatever daily task, pleasure, sport, or activity we may be involved in, His desires are supreme in our lives. If we become careless in the way we wear the garment, haphazardly use the Lord&#39;s name, or serve only socially in the Church, we clearly do not "know" the Master. We might even know the Church is true, but actually knowing Jesus Christ would dramatically change our conduct. We would no longer have a disposition to do evil; rather, we would feel absolutely submissive to His will and turn our lives over to Him. Knowing Him is much, much more than knowing about Him.</i>[Vaughn J. Featherstone,<i>The Incomparable Christ: Our Master and Model</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1995), 26]<br><br>We gain understanding of the power of knowing Him when we reflect on His visit to the American continent. What happened changed the way those people "knew" the Savior. His words had been available to them for their entire lifetimes. Believers among them had taught of Him and prophesied of Him. But when the people really "knew Him," their civilization changed for nearly 200 years. This dramatic change in the Nephite society came because each individual had a thorough knowledge of the Savior. It wasn&#39;t a group experience, although I am sure their testimonies were strengthened by each other. Rather, this was an individual experience, a very personal experience, as Jesus showed Himself to the multitude gathered at the land Bountiful and invited each to "come forth," one by one. He said:<br><br><i>Thrust your hands into my side, . . . feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>Through this powerful testifying experience hearts were softened and converted, and agency was used to follow Him and know Him.<br><br>Sooner or later every person who has lived on this earth will be given knowledge regarding the divinity of Jesus Christ. When He comes the second time, the signs of His divinity will be so overwhelming that "every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess" (D&amp;amp;C 88:104) that Jesus is the Christ. But as explained in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, that type of knowing does not result in a place in the celestial kingdom. Clearly, being acquainted with or being willing to acknowledge that Jesus is the Christ has limited value in the eternities. Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The greatest and most important of all requirements of our Father in heaven and of his Son Jesus Christ, is . . . to believe in Jesus Christ, confess him, . . . cling to him, make friends with him. . . . Open and keep open a communication with . . . our Saviour.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:339]<br><br>In a recent conference address, Elder Dallin H. Oaks indicated that the ultimate priority of Latter-day Saints should be to "seek to understand our relationship to God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and to secure that relationship by obtaining their saving ordinances and by keeping our personal covenants" (Dallin H. Oaks, "Focus and Priorities,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 84).<br><br>One of the reasons a mere acquaintance is not enough is that it does not have the power to change us. That type of knowing leaves us as "natural" men and women. Unlocking the key to eternal life is unlocking the power to change our lives, which power comes from the Savior, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell described the process of the "mighty change":<br><br><i>The more we know of Jesus, the more we will love Him. The more we know of Jesus, the more we will trust Him. The more we know of Jesus, the more we will want to be like Him and to be with Him by becoming the manner of men and women that He wishes us to be.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "Plow in Hope,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 60]<br><br>How then do we come to know Him? I have received great counsel and guidance from John 10:27, where the Savior said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."<br><br>I would like to share several thoughts with you on how we can hear His voice, follow Him, and then be known of Him.<br><br>First, the Savior will be our tutor and trainer in learning to know Him and be as He is. He is there to direct each of us if we will listen to His voice through the Holy Ghost and heed His counsel. I have come to know that His direction and counsel are deeply personal and demonstrate not only the Savior&#39;s love for us but His knowledge of us.<br><br>When President Bateman was serving as the Presiding Bishop of the Church, he testified in a general conference that<br><br><i>the Savior, as a member of the Godhead, knows each of us personally. . . . In the garden and on the cross, Jesus saw each of us and not only bore our sins, but also experienced our deepest feelings so that he would know how to comfort and strengthen us.</i>[Merrill J. Bateman, "The Power to Heal from Within,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, 14]<br><br>In this way, President Bateman explained, the Atonement is not only infinite but also very intimate (see p. 14).<br><br>One of the most profound ways to follow the Savior is through serving others. As we serve others as He served, we come to know Him with great power. The Savior has provided us with many examples of compassion and concern. We see Him with the crippled man at the pool of Bethesda and hear His words of "rise, take up thy bed, and walk" (John 5:8). On the American continent we hear Him ask, "Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. . . . I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you" (3 Nephi 17:7). As we serve, we know Jesus more, and, as Elder Maxwell has said, "To know Jesus more and more is to experience His attributes. . . . We truly accelerate knowing Him, as we become more like Him by means of our imperfect adulation" (Neal A. Maxwell,<i>The Promise of Discipleship</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2001], 20).<br><br>Often we have so many opportunities to serve His children that we become overwhelmed at where to start, and so we do nothing. Our time feels limited. But if we will follow the counsel of Elder Eyring and pray,<br><br><i>"Please tell me who needs me," answers will come. A face or a name will come into our minds. Or we may have a chance meeting that we feel isn&#39;t chance. In those moments, we will feel the love of the Savior for them and for us. As you watch over His sheep, your love for Him will grow. And that will increase your confidence and your courage.</i>[Henry B. Eyring, "Watch with Me,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 40]<br><br>The very details of their needs will be revealed to us. Elder Eyring has explained it this way:<br><br><i>He</i>[the Savior]<i>watches with us. He who sees all things, whose love is endless, and who never sleeps--He watches with us. He knows what the sheep need at every moment. By the power of the Holy Ghost, He can tell us and send us to them.</i>[Eyring, "Watch with Me," 39]<br><br>Let me illustrate the point I am trying to make. A number of years ago I read in the<i>Ensign</i>an experience of Sister Garnee Faulkner. Sister Faulkner had made the commitment to befriend a woman in her ward who had been recently widowed. The widow, named Emma, "was extremely reserved and quiet. Few knew her well. As the months went on, her sorrow did not seem to lessen. Grief and poor health found her withdrawing from activity outside her home." Sometimes Emma quickly terminated Sister Faulkner&#39;s visits. Still, Sister Faulkner "was determined to be her friend, her sister in the gospel, and not let fear or personal rejection dilute [her] concern."<br><br>One day Sister Faulkner and her husband were in San Francisco. As they walked past the large, steaming crab vats on Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, she felt prompted to take some crab home to Emma. Her husband suggested that a more easily transported gift might be a better souvenir. "In and out of the shops [they] went, searching in vain for just the right memento. Empty-handed and tired, [they] started for [the] car, only to pass the crab vats once more." Again the impression came, and so they purchased the crab and a loaf of the Wharf&#39;s famous bread.<br><br>When Sister Faulkner delivered the crab and bread, Emma received them coolly and asked, "Is this for any special occasion?"<br><br>Sister Faulkner replied, "No, I just thought you might enjoy some crab from the Wharf."<br><br>Emma said, "Thank you very much," and closed the door. Sister Faulkner was disheartened and wondered why she had had such a prompting. Two days later she received a letter from Emma.<br><br>Emma described how touched she was by the kind gesture and went on to explain that on that day she had been remembering her anniversary. She had wondered if her husband knew what day it was and if he remembered their marriage and their anniversary. She recalled their first trip to San Francisco and the purchase of steaming crab and a loaf of bread. From then on crab and bread from Fisherman&#39;s Wharf symbolized the many wonderful excursions she and her husband had made to San Francisco.<br><br>"Then," Emma said in her letter, "at the close of day when I opened the door and saw you standing there with a loaf of bread and a package of fresh crab, it was like a direct message. You denied knowing it was a special day. Therefore I felt it was Ed&#39;s way of saying, &#39;Happy anniversary. I do remember.&#39;" (See Garnee Faulkner, "Fresh Crab and French Bread,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1985, 38–39.)<br><br>The Savior knew the intimate details of Emma&#39;s grief, sorrow, and loneliness. And because He knew her, He could give just exactly the right counsel to Sister Faulkner. Sister Faulkner had to be prepared to receive the counsel, and she had demonstrated that preparation in her anxious desire to try to befriend Emma. When the counsel came, it was precisely what Emma needed, and Sister Faulkner became the instrument to do what the Savior knew needed to be done for Emma.<br><br>President Monson has counseled:<br><br><i>Acquire the language of the Spirit. . . . The language of the Spirit comes to him who seeks with all his heart to know God and keep His divine commandments. Proficiency in this "language" permits one to breach barriers, overcome obstacles, and touch the human heart.</i>[Thomas S. Monson, "To the Rescue,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 50]<br><br>One of the most powerful insights I have had in my life is that hearing His voice through the Holy Ghost and acting on the promptings are spiritually synergistic. As we hear and then do, we become more capable of hearing a more refined signal than we have been able to hear before. The result of this upward spiritual spiral is increased auditory and functional capacity as we are taught how the Savior thinks, teaches, and acts. Through these kindergartens for our character we learn how to be like Him.<br><br>An incident from my own life demonstrates this principle. One day I returned home from work. It had been a particularly difficult day, and I felt the burdens of the world. I was extremely fatigued, emotionally and physically. I had not been home long when I felt impressions of the still small voice that I should go to the home of a woman that I had visit-taught for a number of years. She had been inactive for many years. Many times I would try to visit her, but I was often unsuccessful in my attempts. On the few occasions when I was able to visit her, I came to know that she had a strong belief in a Heavenly Father but had been offended many years previously and had difficulty with some of the teachings of the Church. When I felt impressed that I should go to her home, my first response was, "Not tonight. I am so tired. It can wait until tomorrow." But, as is often the case, the impressions continued to come more strongly. Finally I drove to her home, thinking, "Why am I doing this? She probably won&#39;t answer the door." I knocked on the door, and soon the door opened. I could tell she was extremely distraught. She invited me in. Her first words were, "How did you know to come?"<br><br>I responded that the promptings had been there. For the next several hours we talked about her desperate family situation, her suicidal feelings, and her sense of hopelessness. I prayed that I might know how to comfort her as the Savior would do. The words came, the promptings came, and I began to see a calm come to her. That night forever changed my relationship with her and forever changed my relationship with the Savior. Now I never have trouble getting into her home or making contact with her. I no longer question the Spirit&#39;s promptings when they come, for I recognize them more clearly. We have had many opportunities for gospel conversation.<br><br>What did I learn about the Savior that night? I learned that He loved this dear sister regardless of her current standing in the Church. I learned how He comforted as I listened to the promptings I received as I talked with her. Did I know my Savior better after that night? Yes! I learned the Savior trusted me enough to let me participate as He met her needs. I was part of how He "succored" her (see Mosiah 4:16). It was through the listening and the acting that I was able to participate in the Savior&#39;s plan to bless another person&#39;s life. I knew with great assurance that the Savior loves people who are struggling--and it made it easier to believe that He loves me when I struggle as well.<br><br>We come to know the Savior as we try to emulate Him, particularly in charity. Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone described charity as<br><br><i>the very essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the very conduct and total being of the Savior. Charity is the pure love of Christ. Those who have charity are directed by it in everything they do. It becomes the central motivation for their living and being.</i>[Featherstone,<i>The Incomparable Christ,</i>98]<br><br>This trait of charity allows our eyes to be open to seeing one another as He sees us.<br><br>One of our nursing students learned that being like the Savior is more than being able to teach charity, describe charity, or even profess charity. Let me quote from her journal:<br><br><i>I learned the deeper meaning of charity when I cared for a wheelchair-bound HIV patient who had lesions on his hands and buttocks. He was pale as a ghost with a red, spotted rash consuming his body. He wore dark sunglasses, which made him seem even ghastlier, and his partner sat at his bedside. Initially, looking at the men made me physically ill to my stomach. I felt like I should hold my breath, toss the patient his gown, and spend as little time in the room as possible, for I feared that somehow he would inevitably sneeze and I would catch his disease and bring it home to my husband and 10-month-old baby.</i><br><br><i>However, when his mother entered the room, she went to him and kissed him on the forehead and whispered, "Sweetheart, I will never leave you." The words "charity never faileth" came to mind, and my soul melted. I put on my gloves, picked up a bottle of lotion at his bedside, and asked him if he wanted a back rub. That day I felt like I understood the words of the Savior more than ever before: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i><br><br><i>I have been raised with the belief that homosexuality and IV drug abuse are immoral, unethical, and simply wrong. . . . I do believe that there comes a turning point in each person&#39;s life. We must decide when we come to this point whether we will love others for who they are, surrendering judgment and criticism, or allow our prejudgments and the social barriers of the world to stifle another&#39;s spiritual growth as well as our own.</i>[Used by permission; Lisa Flindt, N442 Journal, fall 1994]<br><br>This student learned the powerful truth that we can be taught as we open our minds and hearts to learning from others who are also trying to emulate the Savior in their behavior.<br><br>Coming to know the Savior, learning to hear His voice, and allowing Him to be our Shepherd also requires commitment. This kind of commitment requires all that we have and are. The young man in the New Testament desired to have eternal life and was committed to hearing what the Savior told him he should do to achieve it, yet he could not bring himself to act on what he had heard (see Matthew 19:16–22).<br><br>My great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth Taylor Reynolds, made such a commitment. She heard the gospel taught in England and listened to the Spirit and was baptized. She and her mother acted on what the Spirit taught them after their baptism and made the commitment to journey to Zion. The summer of 1856 found her with approximately 500 other English Saints camped in Nebraska. They heard many reasons why they should not attempt the handcart trek to the Great Salt Lake at that time of year. Elizabeth and her mother voted with the company to move forward and leaned on their trust of God. They survived the terrible snowy ordeal in Martin&#39;s Cove, but their uncle who accompanied them did not. They were rescued by young men who had listened and acted on the counsel of a prophet. She could never look at another handcart after that. But then, the handcart wasn&#39;t the important part of her experience. Elizabeth learned that hearing the Shepherd&#39;s voice and following it may not be easy and may be highly inconvenient, uncomfortable, and potentially life-threatening. To come to know the Lord does require sacrifice, especially the sacrifice of our time, our talents, and everything with which we have been blessed. Elizabeth came through the sacrifice with a deep abiding knowledge of the Lord and His purposes, and so will we.<br><br>Last summer I made a visit to Martin&#39;s Cove, a place made hallowed by the Saints&#39; ultimate sacrifice. Because of Elizabeth&#39;s sacrifice I have had the opportunity of having the gospel in my life and of coming to know the Shepherd.<br><br>Through the process of our listening and doing, the Lord comes to know us. It is true that He knows everything there is to know about us, and He still loves us. Nothing we do or fail to do will ever diminish His love for us. But through our active listening and faithful doing we demonstrate to Him that He can trust us, and we are known of Him in an entirely different way. We are known by Him in friendship and in trust. We are His (see D&amp;amp;C 84:77).<br><br>Mary Ellen Edmunds described it this way in her book<i>Love Is a Verb:</i>While in the post office, she noticed a man who looked as if he might have come from Mexico. He was trying to buy stamps from the stamp machine with a very worn five-dollar bill. The stamp machine repeatedly rejected the bill. Mary Ellen was struck with a deep feeling that she wanted to help the man get his stamps. She found new, crisp bills in her purse, and she and the man were able to buy the stamps he needed. Mary Ellen wrote:<br><br><i>I had another thought that added even more meaning to the experience. I imagined Them Up There somewhere in a meeting. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I could imagine someone interrupting the meeting with an important message: "Excuse me. I hate to interrupt, but there&#39;s a man down there in the Springville Post Office, and he&#39;s trying to get some stamps and can&#39;t make the machine work."</i><br><br><i>Wouldn&#39;t it be something if someone in the meeting had said, "It&#39;s okay. Edmunds is on her way. She&#39;ll help him. We can go back to the agenda." Wouldn&#39;t it be a wonderful thing if God could count on MEE?</i>[Mary Ellen Edmunds,<i>Love Is a Verb</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1995), 34–36]<br><br>Yes, it is a wonderful thing when God can count on us to do His work, to be His instruments in bringing to pass much good in the world. That is how I want my Heavenly Father and my Savior to think of me. I want Them to know me as a friend, as a participant, as a disciple, and as a believer. I want Them to think of me as someone who is trying hard each day to get to know Them better; as someone who is praying and studying and listening and acting, trying to learn to put off the natural man or woman and become a true Saint.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I testify that the Savior meant it when He said, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22). And I also testify that we come to know Him as we hear His voice and follow Him: "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13). My grandfather left his wife and eight children to serve a mission when my father was a baby. My grandfather&#39;s mission president was the apostle Melvin J. Ballard. Because Elder Ballard was held in such high esteem by our family, I have often read his writings. He, as one who knew God and His Son Jesus Christ, described what it was like to come into the presence of the Savior. "One evening in the dreams of the night" he found himself in the temple. He was informed that he would "have the privilege of entering into one of [the] rooms, to meet a glorious Personage." He described it this way:<br><br><i>As I entered the door, I saw, seated on a raised platform, the most glorious Being my eyes have ever beheld or that I ever conceived existed in all the eternal worlds. As I approached to be introduced, he arose and stepped towards me with extended arms, and he smiled as he softly spoke my name. If I shall live to be a million years old, I shall never forget that smile. He took me into his arms and kissed me, pressed me to his bosom, and blessed me, until the marrow of my bones seemed to melt! When he had finished, I fell at his feet, and, as I bathed them with my tears and kisses, I saw the prints of the nails in the feet of the Redeemer of the world. The feeling that I had in the presence of him who hath all things in his hands, to have his love, his affection, and his blessing was such that if I ever can receive that of which I had but a foretaste, I would give all that I am, all that I ever hope to be, to feel what I then felt!</i>[In Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>Sermons and Missionary Services of Melvin Joseph Ballard</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1949), 156]<br><br>My prayer is that we may all know the Savior and be known of Him; that we might engage in the powerful process of hearing the Shepherd&#39;s voice and following Him and in the process become like Him; that we might be counted among His friends and enjoy a life like His--eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God. I so testify of Him, my Savior and Redeemer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mary Williams was an associate dean in the College of Nursing at BYU when this devotional address was given on 17 July 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ert at a Time - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to speak to you today. I am most grateful to Brigham Young University for giving me the privilege of working for almost 30 years in an environment of both faith and scholarship where I have been allowed to teach about Latin America and assist in the development of the library--not the library building, but a collection of more than three million books and other media that makes it feasible to research and study almost any topic one may desire. The collection of the Harold B. Lee Library is a genuine treasure of this university and the Church. My responsibility in that collection has been to bring to this campus the books that reflect the ideas, creativity, and scholarly production of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, as well as of Africa.<br><br>Three years ago I attended the funeral of a very dear friend. It was like most funerals--both a time of rejoicing for a life well lived and of sorrow as those in attendance realized how much they would miss this majestic person. We were saying good-bye to one of the truly great women of the Church in Latin America. As a young teenager, Flavia Garcia Erbolato was one of the first six to be baptized in the interior city of Campinas, Brazil. For more than 50 years she had remained faithful to the Church. After marrying her husband, Oscar Erbolato, and spending a couple of years in the early 1950s here at Brigham Young University, they returned to Brazil and worked and served in numerous positions in São Paulo. Flavia's last job was as the director of translation for the Church in Brazil. Among many other things, she supervised the recent monumental task of retranslating the Book of Mormon into Portuguese. At the viewing, her influence in the Church in Brazil was exemplified by the presence of General Authorities, General Authorities emeritus, past mission presidents, and other leaders of the Church. There were also many others like myself who had benefited from her many quiet and mostly secret Christian acts of kindness.<br><br>The quiet hum of whispering normal at a viewing dissipated with the appearance of an elderly gentleman, Norton Nixon. As he stopped at her casket to pay his regards, he struggled both physically and emotionally. His body was showing the long-term effects of the diabetes that had already taken much of his sight and ability to walk. The physical effort to be at the viewing was considerable, and he probably should not have come. But this was something he would not miss. He wanted to pay his respects to one of his dearest friends. Flavia had been his only convert during a two-and-a-half-year mission to Brazil in the early 1940s that included much hard work, some time in jail, and little feeling of success. Yet his joy was great over this one soul who did come into the Church.<br><br>Watching this beautiful act of expression of love has caused me to contemplate the special link that exists between a missionary and a convert. It is a relationship that is unique in the Church. It has also led me to marvel at how these individual experiences have combined to impact the history of missionary work in the Church during the past 100 years. At the beginning of the 20th century, the number of baptized members was just over 271,000--almost all from the western part of the United States. This number is less than the size of the Church in present-day Argentina. Even by the end of World War II, the number of members had only increased to just less than a million, with the majority still in the United States. However, by the end of this past century, our numbers had grown manyfold, reaching a total of 10,753,000, with the majority living outside of the United States and 36 percent alone from Latin America. (See<i>Deseret News 2001–2002 Church Almanac</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 2000], 580–85.)<br><br>Scholars of religion are becoming interested in the recent growth of the Church, primarily because of the large numbers who have been baptized. At a time when many traditional religions are undergoing declines in membership and attendance, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has experienced the opposite. Scholars are suggesting a variety of social theories, attempting to explain the attraction to a religion that in the past has been seen in a negative light by those who study religion. Their theories are interesting, but for the most part they inadequately explain what is happening, because they fail to examine the spiritual aspect of the experience of conversion.<br><br>Those of us in the Church should understand how that growth has occurred. The Church's growth has been the result of a unique program of sending into the world as missionaries mostly young 19- to 26-year-old single men and women who have had limited training in religious topics and have a minuscule understanding of conversion techniques. These young missionaries perform their work by walking the streets of the world, contacting potential converts through a variety of methods, and asking to teach mostly skeptical investigators their message. We have not grown because of media efforts or grandiose events. Members have come into the Church one convert at a time. They have joined because missionaries have entered their homes and given testimony of the Atonement of Christ and the restoration of the Church, allowing the Spirit of the Lord subsequently to touch their hearts and testify of the veracity of the gospel.<br><br>This program is unique in the history of religion. Never before has such a large group of full-time missionaries been assembled. Ask marketing experts about the advisability of sending young men and women out into the world--many of whom are still teenagers with limited knowledge and experience--and these experts will likely suggest the program is destined for failure. Even we parents of these young missionaries have our doubts. We have watched our children grow and know that often the most significant decision they have made to that point in their lives has been whether or not they will eat broccoli. We often doubt they can become a missionary with the ability and confidence to testify and convince sophisticated adults to change religions. There are probably few missionary parents who have not questioned the authorship of that first letter from their missionary child that describes changes they have experienced or feelings they have developed. Our response as parents is often, "There is no way my son or daughter could have written that letter."<br><br>The missionary program of the Church has few proponents with the exception of ourselves. In fact, most outside of the Church look upon it with scorn and disdain. Some may admire the fact that young men and women are willing to leave home to give two years of service at this time in their lives. There are many who admit that our young missionaries gain valuable experience through work and service and that they develop maturity by seeing diverse cultures and learning new languages. But these few admissions are overshadowed by negative feelings toward what the missionaries actually do. We as faithful members and ex-missionaries occasionally show a lack of understanding of missionary work ourselves through portrayals of the negative or even humorous. I have often wondered if the Brigham Young University Department of Zoology is not losing a great opportunity to build a most amazing collection of cockroaches from all parts of the world by just spending a few weeks following our missionaries. The descriptions I hear at missionary homecomings and firesides of the astounding size and furiousness of cockroaches they seem to encounter on a regular basis would surely result in a collection unequaled in the world. I have noticed, however, that the descriptions of those seemingly regular bug companions of our missionaries increase in dimension when their mothers are present.<br><br>But marketing experts and concerned parents often fail to understand the purpose of the Lord in missionary work or recognize the methods and processes of conversion He uses. We generally focus too much on the missionary when our thoughts should be on the convert. We see how much our sons and daughters have changed instead of understanding what happened to those they have contacted. The conversion story of King Lamoni by the missionary Ammon--one of the four sons of Mosiah--illustrates how the process occurs.<br><br>First, the missionary prepares him or herself to become worthy of the Spirit. Ammon and his three brothers<br><br><i>journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth.</i>[Alma 17:9]<br><br>Second, the Lord grants unto the prepared and worthy missionary His Spirit, and the missionary in turn develops the desire to preach repentance. "And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted" (Alma 17:10).<br><br><i>Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.</i>[Alma 17:16]<br><br>Third, the missionary finds a way to talk to the person about the gospel. After a series of events that I will not describe and that are fortunately outside the experiences of our present-day missionaries, Ammon gained the confidence of King Lamoni and taught him the gospel in his own tongue and with an understanding of the king's culture.<br><br>Fourth, after the teaching and testifying, the Lord touches the heart of the investigator. After Ammon explained the Atonement of Christ, a spiritual experience occurred to the king:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after he</i>[Ammon]<i>had said all these things, and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words.</i><br><br><i>And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.</i><br><br><i>And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead.</i>[Alma 18:40–42]<br><br>It was during this period of unconsciousness that the king was converted, as were many of the people of his kingdom.<br><br>Fifth, the investigator then joins those who are believers.<br><br><i>And it came pass that there were many that did believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.</i>[Alma 19:35]<br><br>Notice that the scriptures say very little about how much Ammon changed or matured. The scripture talks about the conversion of King Lamoni. Also note the terminology of Ammon to describe how he wanted to be used in the conversion process: "that they might be an instrument in the hands of God." Missionaries do not convert, they are mere instruments that allow the spirit of testimony to enter into the heart of the investigator. One recent missionary to Latin America has described this role in the following manner:<br><br><i>There is nothing I have ever done to this point of my life easier than missionary work. Physically and mentally it was demanding--even draining at times. However, the process of conversion was the easiest thing I have ever been associated with, and that is because I had nothing to do with it. I did nothing. It was the Spirit which worked that great change in the hearts of so many wonderful people.</i>[Anthony Grover, Missionary Homecoming Address, Grove Ward, Pleasant Grove Stake, June 1998]<br><br>In examining this process, it becomes clear the way conversion occurs. Missionaries have the responsibility to become worthy of the Spirit through fasting, prayer, obeying mission rules, and working hard. Thus prepared, when the missionary enters the home of an investigator, the Lord uses that righteous vessel or instrument to bring His Spirit into that house. The Spirit enters the soul of a person and begins the process Alma has described as "a change of heart" (Alma 5:26). That is why we do missionary work. We hope and expect that our missionaries are changed by being part of this process, but the importance of the experience is that the investigator feels not what the missionary has given them but the Spirit of the Lord. We don't send our sons and daughters out into the world in the prime of their lives and spend thousands of dollars to support them just so they will be trained as leaders or perhaps gain cultural experiences or learn a language.<br><br>The history of the growth of the Church throughout the world is a story of how that process has occurred millions of times in every corner of this planet. I am moved to think of the many millions of homes that have been tracted, the hundreds of millions of lessons that have been given, and the millions of times our missionaries have borne testimony of the Atonement of Christ and the truthfulness of the gospel. Every one of those brief moments of expression of testimony forms part of a sacred and righteous blanket that is covering the earth with the testimony of truth and spirit.<br><br>Nowhere has this process been more striking than in Latin America during the past 50 years. At the end of World War II, missionaries could be found in only three countries of Latin America. There were just over six thousand members, most of whom lived in Mexico. By the end of this past century, a total of 8,859 congregations (wards and branches) had been organized, and almost four million had been baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ in Latin America. More than 60 percent of all new converts to the Church speak Spanish or Portuguese. Obviously not all continue as active members, and there are serious challenges of retention and activation--as there are throughout the Church--but even with these challenges this story is one of amazing proportions.<br><br>The great missionary stories of the 19th century in America and Europe were often those of apostles such as Brigham Young, Wilford Woodruff, or John Taylor teaching and converting large numbers of members. Apostles who served as missionaries in Latin America did not have comparable success. Parley P. Pratt went to Chile in 1851 and returned after four months without a single convert. Apostle Moses Thatcher went to Mexico City in 1879 and baptized a few--many of whom soon left the Church, following a disgruntled branch president into apostasy. Elder Melvin J. Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve and Elder Rey L. Pratt of the Seventy spent six months in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1925 and 1926 and baptized seven--six of whom came into the Church the week after they arrived, having been taught and prepared by members baptized in Germany who had recently immigrated to Argentina. Elders Ballard and Pratt distributed more than 11,000 pamphlets and fliers during those six months, and Apostle Ballard described his mission as "the most difficult piece of missionary work that I have undertaken" (<i>CR,</i>October 1926, 38). His comment just prior to leaving Argentina was surely prophetic. At a testimony meeting on July 4, 1926, in Buenos Aires, he said:<br><br><i>The work of the Lord will grow slowly for a time here just as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day as does the sunflower that grows quickly and then dies. But thousands will join the Church here. It will be divided into more than one mission and will be one of the strongest in the Church. The work here is the smallest that it will ever be. The day will come when the Lamanites in this land will be given a chance. The South American Mission will be a power in the Church.</i>[In Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>Sermons and Missionary Services of Melvin Joseph Ballard</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1949), 100; see also<i>Melvin J. Ballard ... Crusader for Righteousness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), 84]<br><br>We owe a great debt of gratitude to the early missionaries and converts from Latin America who accepted the gospel and struggled to maintain their faith. Those early missionaries had few if any converts and endured difficult and trying circumstances. It was not easy for their few converts to remain in the Church. Early-19th-century members from the United States and Europe joined under trying times and because of the call to gather to Zion experienced the difficult trip to Utah, but when they arrived they joined a people who believed as they believed and had similar goals and desires. Early converts in Latin America went through similar persecutions when they joined the Church, but, unlike their 19th-century predecessors, they remained in their countries for the most part and confronted continuous persecution, working in small branches trying to create their own small piece of Zion far away from the security and comfort of the Church in Utah. Creating that Zion was not easy and took many years. Their pioneering experiences were different but no less heroic than the experiences of those who crossed the plains of the United States.<br><br>Milton Soares, the first convert in northeastern Brazil, realized the less-than-sympathetic reaction he was to get from family and acquaintances when shortly after his conversion he informed a few of his close friends that he had been baptized into the only true church on the earth. They asked him how many members belonged to the Church in the area.<br><br>"Only me," was his reply.<br><br>His friends couldn't stop laughing. "Only you? How could a church be any good if you are the only member?" (See Mark L. Grover, "Milton and Irene Soares: Mormon Pioneers of Northeastern Brazil," in<i>Pioneers in Every Land</i>, eds. Bruce A. Van Orden, D. Brent Smith, and Everett Smith, Jr. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 102.)<br><br>Last December Milton and his dear wife, Irene, were privileged to be in attendance at the dedication of the Recife Brazil Temple, an event marked by the rejoicing of many thousands of members in northeastern Brazil, all of whom had joined the Church since Milton's baptism.<br><br>Often the price paid for membership in the Church was great. Jesucita Mera de Monroy was a widow and mother of four children. In 1902, after the death of her husband, she moved to the town of San Marcos in central Mexico, where she worked in a governmental position and operated a small grocery store. In March of 1913 Elders W. Ernest Young and Willard Huish visited San Marcos to conduct a funeral service for the only member in the town, Jesús Sanchez. After the funeral Señora Monroy approached the missionaries and asked them to come to her home and teach her family the gospel. After close to three months of studying, she and several members of her family, including her adult son Rafael, were baptized. This family became stalwarts in the Church, and they were influential in the development of a strong branch in the region.<br><br>Mexico was then in the midst of a civil war in which its citizenry, including members of the Church, often became innocent victims of violence. Two months after the baptism of the Monroy family, the American missionaries left Mexico because of concern for their safety. The members were left on their own. Rafael was put in charge of the small San Marcos branch. Unfortunately, in July 1915, because of a misunderstanding concerning his political activity, Rafael Monroy; Vicente Morales, his first counselor in the branch; and three of Jesucita's daughters--Natalina, Jovita, and Guadalupe--were imprisoned by one of the revolutionary groups in the region. Their religious affiliation with the Church played a part in their arrest.<br><br>Jesucita was frantic as she tried to satisfy the demands of the leaders of the group and convince them that her children were innocent of any crime. After two days of interrogation and torture, Rafael Monroy and Vicente Morales were executed by a firing squad. Jesucita had the terrible and lonely task of recovering the bodies and organizing their burial, since most in the village, including members of the Church, distanced themselves from her and her family. Her trials continued, and she found it necessary to move from the town for a while. Her letter to Rey L. Pratt, then president of the Mexican Mission, shows her strength and faith in the gospel: "Our sorrows have been grievous, but our faith is strong, and we will never forsake this religion" (quoted in Walter Ernest Young,<i>The Diary of W. Ernest Young</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1973), 121). Her promise was kept, and she and most members of her family remained faithful to the Church. (See Mark L. Grover, "Execution in Mexico: The Deaths of Rafael Monroy and Vicente Morales,"<i>BYU Studies</i>35, no. 3 (1995–96): 6–28.)<br><br>Jesucita Mera de Monroy's example is but one of many stories of early converts in Mexico who weathered the hardships and struggles of being members of the Church and became a strong foundation for a Mexican membership that may soon surpass a million baptized members.<br><br>These faithful members came into the Church with the help of equally faithful and obedient missionaries. One example from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, shows the important role of the missionary. Valentina Alexandre was a young mother of three children going through a crisis. Her husband, José, had passed through a difficult experience that resulted in the loss of his means of supporting the family. To make ends meet he had begun driving a taxi seven days a week, 12 hours a day. Valentina was desperate. Christmas was close, and there would be no presents for her children. One morning after a difficult experience with one of her daughters, Valentina went to her knees and in desperation pleaded for help from the Lord. After leaving her bedroom she began cleaning the floors of her house. Someone knocked on her door. Outside were Elders Charles Allison and Paul Hindmarsh. In her despair, the last thing Valentina wanted was to talk to a couple of Americans, and she asked them to leave--which they did. She returned to cleaning her floors. A few minutes later she heard the same knock on the door, and again the two American missionaries were standing there. She was even more upset. This time Elder Allison apologized and explained to her that as he was walking down the street away from the house he felt a strong impression that he needed to return. In desperation, knowing of no other way to get rid of them, Valentina asked what they wanted. Their request was simple. They desired a few minutes to leave a blessing on the house. As these two missionaries knelt on a partly cleaned floor and began to pray, Valentina had this statement come clearly into her mind: "You asked for help, and I sent it." The entire family was soon baptized, and most have remained true and faithful to the Church. (See Valentina Alexandre, Oral History, interviewed by Mark L. Grover, April 24–25, 1990, Provo, Utah. Copy in possession of the author.)<br><br>Notice the way this experience unfolded. Because of difficult times in their lives, a young family was ready and prepared for the gospel. Valentina had pleaded for help, and the response of the Lord was to send the missionaries to their house. The activities of the missionaries interest me. Elder Allison told me that he has very little memory of that day. He doesn't remember anything different or special that they did prior to coming to her door. Why were they in that neighborhood at that exact time? He doesn't know. How much of the coincidence of their presence was due to the fact that two worthy and faithful missionaries arose from their beds at six a.m. that morning, had scripture study, and prayed to the Lord to be guided to the homes of those who were prepared for the gospel? But, most important, as they were walking away from that house and received the inspiration to return to a place from which they had just been turned away, they responded and did as they were inspired to do. I have no doubt that had they not been worthy or had not followed the Spirit that day, the Alexandre family would have somehow been guided to the Church in another way. But Elders Allison and Hindmarsh would not have had the privilege and honor of being the instruments of the Lord through which a worthy family joined the Church. I wonder how many times we have not been privileged to be an instrument because we were not worthy to receive or willing to follow the spirit that whispered to us, "Return to that house."<br><br>Conversion to the Church is not something that occurs easily. It requires faith, prayer, fasting, and work on the part of the missionary. There is also often a long and difficult period of preparation in the life of the convert. I am moved when I watch our young missionaries get their calls and listen to their farewell addresses, knowing that at that very moment people are being prepared and readied for that exact missionary.<br><br>Walter Guedes de Queiroz was an energetic and active young man. He was also very serious and had a strong desire to serve the Lord. That desire encouraged him to enter the ministry and become a pastor in a Methodist Church in São Paulo, Brazil. In the 1950s, while enrolled in a Protestant school of the ministry, his study of the Bible led him to a serious conflict with the Protestant doctrines of infant baptism and priesthood authority. Those issues were of such importance to Walter that eventually he made the decision to leave the school and the ministry and begin a search for a church that taught the doctrines he considered to be biblical. His search took him to all the major religions in Brazil, but none of them could satisfy him in his search.<br><br>Fortunately three other colleagues in the school had the same concerns and had joined him in a search for the truth. These four friends would get together to read the Bible and talk. In one of these sessions they decided to use the telephone book and go through the names of the different churches listed. They came across the name of a church with which they were not very familiar: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One of the four, Hélio da Rocha Camargo, made contact with the missionaries and asked a simple question: "Does your Church have apostles and prophets? If so, we would like to talk to you."<br><br>When Walter met with the missionaries, his request was the following: "I don't want you to ask me any questions, because I am the one searching for answers. I am after a response so important that it is a matter of life and death to me. I want you to tell me the story of your prophet, and then I will determine if he is a true or false prophet."<br><br>The missionaries could barely contain their excitement, realizing they had the most golden of all contacts. They asked Walter if he had at least 40 minutes for them to tell the story. At the end of a discussion on the Apostasy and Restoration, Walter was able to say with a conviction that has never left him, "Joseph Smith was a prophet of God."<br><br>The next time he saw his friend Hélio da Rocha Camargo, he exclaimed, "I have finally found that for which I have been looking. I no longer need to search." During the next few months three of the four--Walter, Hélio, and Saul Messias de Oliveira--joined along with their families and became stalwarts of the Church in Brazil, all serving as bishops, stake presidents, and mission presidents. Elder Camargo become the first Brazilian General Authority of the Church. Few in the history of the Church have been so well prepared to accept the gospel as those three men. (See Walter Guedes de Queiroz, Oral History, interviewed by Mark L. Grover, April 16, 1982, Pôrto Alegre, Brazil, 3–4. A published version of these conversions is found in "A Trilogy of Truthseekers," in<i>No More Strangers,</i>eds. Hartman Rector and Connie Rector, vol. 2 [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973], 103–122.)<br><br>In this story, as in all I have recounted, there are important lessons to be learned for those of us who are members of the Church. Our initial conversion is an essential part of our experience in the Church. But conversion does not occur only once in our lives. It is an event that should happen often and become an integral aspect of our Church experience. Regardless of the logic of its organization or attraction of teachings and doctrines, we become and remain members of the Church through a conversion experience and maintain our faith through a constant process of spiritual renewal. That process is beautifully described in the masterful discourse of Alma to the members of the Church in Zarahemla. In this treatise he presented the concept of being spiritually born of God and receiving His image in our countenances. After explaining the importance of that experience, he then turned his attention to the members who have been spiritually born of God:<br><br><i>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</i><br><br><i>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?</i><br><br><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.</i>[Alma 5:26–28]<br><br>As Alma suggested, those of us who have had that experience at least once in our lives have need of constant renewal. That renewal is obtained by prayer, fasting, reading of the scriptures, Church attendance, and service to others. Our paths will be laden with trials and tribulations and often sin. The anguish of repentance and the relief of forgiveness are important steps though which we all pass. Then, on a regular basis the Lord will visit us with His quiet yet powerful spirit of conversion in which the depths of our souls will be touched and we again will "sing the song of redeeming love." With that assurance we will have the strength to continue on the path toward salvation. Those spiritual experiences thus become the reasons for continued activity in the Church. Armed with the Spirit, we will do as the missionary does: strive to become an instrument of the Lord to do His work. With such preparation we hope and expect to be in the right place at the right time so that the Spirit of the Lord will inspire us and use us as His instrument.<br><br>I return to the story of Flavia Erbolato and Norton Nixon. A little over a year ago Norton finally succumbed to the disease of diabetes and passed away. I can only imagine the joy he and Flavia must have felt as they greeted each other on the other side of the veil. Flavia's conversion though a very personal and private experience will always be connected to a young man who gave up two and a half years of his life to serve the Lord. One of Norton's greatest joys that overshadows all of the trials and tribulations that came to him in this life was the privilege to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord and witness the conversion of such a daughter of God. He would surely proclaim, as did Alma, "The Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors" (Alma 36:25).<br><br>It is my prayer that we will always make the renewal of our conversion an integral part of our lives and strive to be worthy to be an instrument in His hands to further His work. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mark L. Grover was a senior librarian at the BYU Harold B.

<h1>Young: A Bold Prophet - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am pleased to be here and help all of you memorialize a great leader whose birth 200 years ago we celebrate. Much has been written and said about Brigham Young and his great leadership and accomplishments. There is little that has not been thoroughly pored over, analyzed, and commented upon. To present some history about this great leader that is not so well known, I asked Ron Esplin for his able assistance, and I am indebted to him for much of the material I am using.<br><br>One evening in early 1859, after the peaceful conclusion of the Utah War--a keen test of leadership for Brigham Young--the ordeal was being discussed and the men in Brigham Young's office were talking about the game of chess. President Young remarked that he "knew nothing of such games." But then he added, "I have had to play with the kingdoms of the world, with ... living characters." When some observed that he had played "a great game," he replied, "Yes, and I am not displeased with nor regret any move that I have made" (17 February 1859, Brigham Young Office Journal, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>I have chosen to focus on what appears to me to be the source of his absolute self-confidence and the complete certainty he had in his own judgment. I know of no other explanation for his boldness and audacity in thinking of moving a whole people--more than 60,000--by wagon and handcart across much of the North American wilderness to the Great Basin. As President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>No plow had even broken its soil. He knew nothing of its fertility, nothing of the seasons, the weather, the frost, the severity of the winters, the possibility of insect plagues. Jim Bridger and Miles Goodyear had nothing good to say concerning this place. Sam Brannan pleaded with him to go on to California. He listened to none of them. He led his people to this hot and what must have appeared as a very forlorn place. When he arrived, he looked across this broad expanse to the salt lake in the west and said, "This is the right place."</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, Brigham Young 200th birthday anniversary gala, 1 June 2001, unpublished]<br><br>Brigham Young was present, along with Wilford Woodruff and others, when the Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>"Brethren, I have been very much edified and instructed in your testimonies here tonight, but I want to say to you before the Lord, that you know no more concerning the destinies of this Church and kingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." ... He said, "It is only a little handful of priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America--it will fill the world." ... "It will fill the Rocky Mountains. There will be tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints who will be gathered in the Rocky Mountains. ... This people will go into the Rocky Mountains; they will there build temples to the Most High."</i>[Joseph Smith, quoted by Wilford Woodruff,<i>CR,</i>April 1898, 57; punctuation and spelling modernized]<br><br>How could Brigham Young have been so sure when he told Wilford Woodruff, upon entering the valley, "This is the right place. Drive on"? The answer is that as the Valley of the Great Salt Lake came into view, Brigham Young was seeing much more than the salt flats and the swarms of black crickets. Sometime later Wilford Woodruff described their entrance into the valley in these words:<br><br><i>When we came out of the cañon into full view of the valley, I turned the side of my carriage around, open to the west, and President Young arose from his bed and took a survey of the country. While gazing on the scene before us, he was enwrapped in vision for several minutes. He had seen the valley before in vision, and upon this occasion he saw the future glory of Zion and of Israel, as they would be, planted in the valleys of these mountains. When the vision had passed, he said: "It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on."</i>[Wilford Woodruff, in<i>The Utah Pioneers</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Printing and Publishing Establishment, 1880), 23; quoted in B. H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Century One,</i>6 vols. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1930), 3:224]<br><br>I believe this is why Brigham Young summarily ignored the comments of Jim Bridger, Miles Goodyear, and Sam Brannan. Without a second thought Brigham Young dismissed Sam Brannan's entreaties to take the Saints on to California. His certainty that the Valley of the Great Salt Lake and the Great Basin was the right place rested upon the higher intelligence he had received in the vision before they started.<br><br>Brigham Young has been recognized by many for his leadership ability. Even critics and nonmembers regarded him as a great colonizer. Characterized by some as the practical sage, he was also a man of great faith, and I believe that it was his profound faith that was at the very heart of his success as a leader. With this profound faith came a sense of confidence, not only in the rise of the Church and the growth of the kingdom but also in his own role as a prophet and leader.<br><br>Having been a keen observer of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of many of the events of the Restoration, Brigham bore strong witness that the leadership keys had been left with the Twelve after the Prophet was martyred--indeed, that the Lord had "commanded [Joseph Smith] to endow the Twelve with these keys and priesthood" (Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56], 1:259). In the dark days following the Martyrdom, Brigham reminded the Saints, "You cannot appoint a prophet; but if you let the Twelve remain and act in their place, the keys of the kingdom are with them and they can manage the affairs of the church and direct all things aright" (8 August 1844, in<i>HC</i>7:235). He also told the Saints that if they would not sustain the Twelve, then the Twelve would raise up a people who would! That showed how much confidence he had in the Twelve. He knew they had the keys, the commission, and the responsibility to build on the foundation Joseph had laid.<br><br>Brigham and the apostles all knew the importance of completing the Nauvoo Temple, and with their example and enthusiasm, construction work accelerated. The fire of their enthusiasm brought rapid progress and feelings of great joy in seeing their goal coming to pass. However, as their enemies saw the walls go up, they felt threatened and vowed to drive them out before their beloved temple could be finished. In the midst of this angry furor, Brigham Young inquired of the Lord whether they should stay and finish the temple. He recorded in his diary: "The answer was we should" (24 January 1845, Brigham Young Office Files, 1832–1878, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>Brigham Young remained calm. "I am composed," he told the Nauvoo Legion before some of them took the field, "nor has the late disturbance had any effect upon me" (quoted by Hosea Stout, 17 September 1845, in<i>On the Mormon Frontier: The Diary of Hosea Stout, 1844–1861,</i>ed. Juanita Brooks, 2 vols. [Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1964], 1:65).<br><br>Clearly Brigham Young was sustained by inner strength and spiritual gifts. He was a man such as Joseph Smith once described who enjoyed a personal promise from God that was<br><br><i>as an anchor to the soul sure &amp;amp; steadfast. Though the thunders might roll, &amp;amp; lightnings flash &amp;amp; earthquakes Bellow &amp;amp; war gather thick around yet this hope &amp;amp; knowledge would support the soul in evry hour of trial trouble &amp;amp; tribulation.</i>[Joseph Smith, quoted by Wilford Woodruff, 14 May 1843, in<i>Wilford Woodruff's Journal: 1833–1898 Typescript,</i>ed. Scott G. Kenney, 9 vols. (Midvale, Utah: Signature Books, 1983–1984), 2:231]<br><br>The construction continued despite the threats of the mob, and rooms of the temple were dedicated as they were completed. As the Saints began to receive their temple blessings, Brigham Young said to those being endowed:<br><br>[If you (that is, the Twelve and others endowed before the completion of the temple)]<i>will be as diligent in prayer as a few has been I promise you in the name of Israels God that we shall accomplish the will of God and go out in due time from the gentiles with power and plenty and no power shall stay us.</i>[Brigham Young, quoted by William Clayton, 7 December 1845, in<i>An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton,</i>ed. George D. Smith (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995), 194]<br><br>History shows that the Saints surely did go out from the presence of their enemies and found the place that God had prepared for them.<br><br>As he led the Saints across the American wilderness, Brigham Young believed strongly that this journey to the West was the Lord's errand--therefore they could not fail. But being the practical man that he was, he knew that success had a price. It could only come with diligence, sacrifice, and hardship. And he understood that, even with their best efforts, they could not do it alone--they would need God's help. But his great faith and sense of purpose brought him both confidence and peace during the winter and spring of 1847 as he prepared for the long trek West.<br><br>Part of President Young's unwavering confidence came because he knew the plan was not his own. As he told the Saints nearly 10 years later after their arrival in the valley, "I did not devise the great scheme of the Lord's opening the way to send this people to these mountains." Who did? "It was the power of God that wrought out salvation for this people," he insisted. "I never could have devised such a plan" (<i>JD</i>4:41 [31 August 1856]).<br><br>Further tests of President Young's faith were still in store. The severest one came during 1857 and 1858 as thousands of U.S. troops--one-third of the standing army of the United States--marched to Utah escorting Alfred Cumming, who had been sent to replace Brigham Young as governor. President Young knew only too well from their experience in Missouri what enemies can do when backed by military authority. Yet he was confident that if the Saints did all in their power, the Lord would help them. President Young declared martial law and mobilized the territorial militia to do everything short of bloodshed to slow down the advancing troops. Grasslands and supply wagons were burned, provisions and cattle confiscated, and the advance units harassed day and night. Still they kept coming--ever nearer--until winter struck in their favor as the timely arrival of heavy snows stopped the army in its tracks, forcing it into winter camp 80 miles from Mormon settlements.<br><br>Brigham Young recognized that his leadership was not flawless. "There are weaknesses manifested in men that I am bound to forgive," he said on one occasion. "I am right there myself. I am liable to mistakes," he continued, saying he was just as set in his feelings as any man alive, but "I am where I can see the light. I try to keep in the light" (30 April 1860, Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives). The assurance he felt was not that he would never make mistakes or would always know what was best but that, in the end, God oversees the essential. He quickly abandoned what did not work well for something that might work better, but his ultimate direction and destination remained unchanged. Long-term goals based on revelation provided a balanced consistency in his day-to-day decisions and gave him the confidence to press forward regardless of the obstacles or even the errors.<br><br>Sometimes his bold and powerful leadership was disconcerting. For example, after his dangerous winter journey to the Salt Lake Valley to mediate peace with the army, Colonel Kane was at first offended when Brigham Young rejected his counsel. However, when Kane finally agreed to do whatever President Young told him to do, this is what Brigham said of that incident:<br><br><i>I told him as he had been inspired to Come here he should go to the armey and do as the spirit led him to do and all would be right and he did so and all was right.</i><br><br><i>He thought</i>[it]<i>vary strange because we were not afraid of the armey. I told him we were not afraid of all the world. If they made war upon us the Lord was able to deliver us out of their hands and would do it if we did right.</i>[Brigham Young, quoted by Wilford Woodruff, 15 August 1858, in<i>Wilford Woodruff's Journal,</i>5:209]<br><br>A few months after the peaceful resolution of the Utah War, President Young walked past the temple grounds to the Staines Mansion--now the Devereaux House--to visit Governor Cumming. Concerned that they had narrowly averted disaster, the fair-minded governor cautioned Brigham Young to refrain from provocative or rash acts in the future. The president replied, "With all due respect to your excellency, ... I do not calculate to take the advice of any man that lives, in relation to my affairs." Although he recognized he had friends and counselors to advise him during such crises, he made it plain that in God alone would he trust. "My religion is true," he told the governor solemnly, "and I am determined to obey its precepts while I live." He would, he insisted, "follow the council of my heavenly Father, and I have faith to follow it, and risk the consequences." He concluded, "You may think strange of it, but you will yet see that I am right" (24 April 1859, Manuscript History of the Church, LDS Church Archives; see also B. H. Roberts,<i>Comprehensive History of the Church,</i>4:517–18).<br><br>Understanding Brigham Young's religious conviction and the religious context within which Latter-day Saints responded to him is essential to an understanding of his leadership. As one visitor to his office recorded and others noted, Brigham Young had amazing self-confidence and "absolute certainty of himself and his own opinions" (Fitz Hugh Ludlow,<i>The Heart of the Continent: A Record of Travel Across the Plains and in Oregon</i>[New York: Hurd and Houghton, 1870; New York: AMS Press, 1971], 368). This certainty stemmed from his conviction that he was doing God's work. He believed that if he and other mortals did all they could to establish the kingdom, God would see to the rest. This makes understandable his firmness and calm, unshakable optimism in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances.<br><br>The skeptical but perceptive Frenchman Jules Remy recognized that Brigham Young, being clearly<br><br><i>convinced of the truth of the religion he has embraced, ... has set before him, as the object of his existence, the extension and the triumph of his doctrine; and this end he pursues with a tenacity that nothing can shake, and with that stubborn persistence and ardent ambition which makes great priests and great statesmen.</i>[Jules Remy and Julius L. Brenchley,<i>A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City,</i>2 vols. (London: W. Jeffs, 1861; New York: AMS Press, 1971), 1:497]<br><br>The leadership of "the eminent politician and the able administrator" was at root religious, Remy and his companion were forced to conclude, and they left him "perfectly convinced of the sincerity of his faith" (Remy,<i>A Journey,</i>1:495; 2:303).<br><br>Brigham was a firm believer in faith and works. He knew from the start that if the Saints did their part, the Lord would do the rest (see<i>JD</i>6:328–29 [6 April 1854];<i>JD</i>3:154 [6 May 1855];<i>JD</i>5:293 [4 October 1857]). Brigham Young showed his faith by expending every energy and resource on good works before turning to God for assistance. That was part of the program, what God expected, and what was necessary if man was to develop. Don't ask God to protect you from Indians if you are unwilling to build forts, he counseled. Man is left alone, he taught, "to practise him to depend on his own resources, and try his independency" (28 January 1857, Brigham Young Office Journal, LDS Church Archives).<br><br>Folklore has preserved this attitude in the story of President Young overlooking the valley with an admiring minister: "What you and the Lord have done with this place is truly amazing," observed the visitor, to which President Young replied, "Yes, Reverend, but you should have seen it when the Lord had it alone!" Man was to use all his skills and effort and energy for the kingdom, and if that was not enough, then he might ask for God's intervention.<br><br>Though proud of his down-to-earth but formidable talents, Brigham Young gave credit to God for the gift of them. "I know how I received the knowledge that I have got," he said in 1866. Recalling his early years with Joseph, "I had but one prayer, and I offered that all the time. And that was that I might be permited to hear Joseph speak on doctrine, and see his mind reach out untramelled to grasp the deep things of God." He maintained that "an angel never watched him closer" and that he "would constantly watch him and if possible learn doctrine and principle beyond that which he expressed." It required several years of this close attention to the Prophet, he declared with some exaggeration, "before I pretended to open my mouth to speak at all" (Brigham Young, 8 October 1866, general conference address, Historian's Office Reports of Speeches, LDS Church Archives). Brigham Young took care to never "let an opportunity pass of getting with the Prophet Joseph and of hearing him speak in public or in private, so that I might draw understanding from the fountain from which he spoke." "This," he insisted, "is the secret of the success of your humble servant" (Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>12:269–70 [16 August 1868]).<br><br>President Hunter told me of a time many years ago when he heard of an elderly man who had worked on the Salt Lake Temple as an engineer when he was a young man. This engineer was not a member of the Church and was for a time in Salt Lake City before going on to his destination in California. The engineer recalled seeking an appointment with President Brigham Young--in those days visitors sat on a bench and moved along the bench as they waited for an appointment with the president. The engineer wanted counsel from the president regarding a construction problem on the temple. Brigham Young made furniture and did carpentry, and so he knew a few practical things about construction; he had an eye for things of that kind. But he had never constructed a building like the temple. On this occasion he looked at the plan for a part of the Salt Lake Temple that this engineer had brought. He drew a line in the shape of an arc and said, "This is the way to construct it." As I remember it, the engineer never joined the Church but testified, "You can't tell me Brigham Young was not a prophet."<br><br>In the early days of the Church, many fell away because they would not sustain Joseph Smith as the Lord's anointed. In fact, the Prophet Joseph said of the leaders in Kirtland that "there have been but two but what have lifted their heel against me--namely Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball" (<i>HC</i>5:412). Because of their faithful loyalty, the Lord called Brigham Young to lead the Church out West, and when the First Presidency was reorganized, Heber C. Kimball was called as first counselor to Brigham Young.<br><br>Brigham Young died with the name Joseph upon his lips. He spoke of him and his work in these words: "I honor and revere the name of Joseph Smith. I delight to hear it; I love it. I love his doctrine" (<i>JD</i>13:216 [17 July 1870]). "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet whom the Lord raised up and ordained" (<i>JD</i>3:51 [6 October 1855]). "I am bold to say that, Jesus Christ excepted, no better man ever lived or does live upon this earth. I am his witness" (<i>JD</i>9:332 [3 August 1862]).<br><br>In the marvelous experience of Brigham Young in February of 1847, when the Prophet Joseph appeared to him in a dream or vision, Brigham pleaded to be reunited with him. Brigham Young asked him if he had a message for the Brethren. The Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>Tell the people to be humble and faithful, and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach you what to do and where to go; it will yield the fruits of the kingdom. Tell the brethren to keep their hearts open to conviction, so that when the Holy Ghost comes to them, their hearts will be ready to receive it.</i><br><br>The Prophet further directed Brigham Young as follows:<br><br><i>They can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God.</i>[23 February 1847,<i>Manuscript History of Brigham Young: 1846–1847,</i>ed. Elden J. Watson (Salt Lake City: Elden Jay Watson, 1971), 529]<br><br>I add my witness to the great prophetic leadership of Brigham Young and testify that that prophetic leadership and the keys of that office have remained in the Church and rest upon our great prophet in this day and time, President Gordon B. Hinckley. May we always be found following the counsel and direction of our prophets I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James E.

<h1> Banyan Tree - Merrill J. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It seems only a short time ago that Brigham Young University completed its first century. Now one-fourth of the second century has elapsed. I remember the interest among the faculty and students in 1975 as the university celebrated the achievements of the first 100 years. Excitement surrounded President Spencer W. Kimball's second-century address--an October 1975 devotional in which he provided guideposts for the future and spoke of BYU becoming an "educational Everest" ("The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976], 244). His vision for BYU in its second century parallels the theme of this year's conference taken from President Brigham Young, who said, "We should be a people of profound learning" (<i>JD</i>8:40). The thoughts of both Presidents Young and Kimball are similar to those echoed by other prophets of this dispensation. In fact, President John Taylor not only believed we should become a learned people but foresaw the day of Zion's excellence. He stated:<br><br><i>You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br>In like manner, President Gordon B. Hinckley has spoken of the importance of obtaining an education and has counseled members that they are under "commandment to continue to study and to learn" (<i>TGBH,</i>300).<br><br><i>None of us can assume that he has learned enough. As the door closes on one phase of life, it opens on another, where we must continue to pursue knowledge. Ours ought to be a ceaseless quest for truth.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>301]<br><br>Today's theme of profound learning is a focus on excellence. It reminds us of the past intellectual and spiritual foundations provided by those who preceded us and upon which we build. It points to the future of becoming a people of profound learning and inquiry. It is particularly appropriate that the theme is taken from the words of President Young as we celebrate his 200th birthday.<br><br>My purpose today is threefold. The first objective is to describe Brigham Young University's role in the kingdom as seen by its prophets and leaders. The second is to review the last quarter century and evaluate the progress made by the university. Third, if our destiny is one of profound learning and excellence both spiritually and secularly, what are the tasks that lie ahead? What can we do to assure our ascent to new heights?<br><h2><b>Brigham Young University's Role in the Kingdom</b></h2><br>The role of Brigham Young University during the first 100 years was clear. It was to strengthen members and provide faithful leaders and teachers for the Church. Karl G. Maeser, faced with numerous problems in the 1880s, decided to leave Brigham Young Academy. He changed his mind, however, when in a dream he saw tens of thousands of members that would be blessed by a modern university on Temple Hill.<br><br>President Franklin S. Harris, after a meeting with the board of trustees, recognized the university's role in providing leaders in all disciplines. He said:<br><br><i>The President of the Church, Commission of Education, and all who have anything to do with the Church schools are determined to make this the great Church University. . . . When someone tells you that all the institution will do will be to prepare teachers, tell them they don't know what they are talking about. There is nothing greater than to be a teacher, but the school will have to prepare leaders in other directions just as well. . . . All Mormondom cannot be educated here, but I hope to see the time when two of a city . . . will come here to become leaders.</i>[In Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen,<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), 239]<br><br>President Heber J. Grant recognized the role of BYU in providing teachers for the Church educational system. In the depths of the 1930s depression, financial pressures caused the First Presidency to announce the closure of all Church schools, including Brigham Young University. In a meeting following the announcement, a key member of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees asked President Grant who would provide teachers for the Church. After a moment of reflection, the president reversed his decision regarding this institution. Most other Church schools were closed or given to the public sector. From the beginning, the mandate was clear. Brigham Young University's role was to build testimony, prepare students for their work in the world, and provide teachers and leaders for the Church.<br><br>As Church growth accelerated in the 1970s and the university began serving a smaller and smaller fraction of the membership, questions regarding its role and purpose began to surface. If the university could not accommodate all members who desired to attend or even "two of a city," why should the Church support it? Although BYU produces more teachers than any other university in the world, is it enough to justify its existence? Even with 9,000 graduates per year, the number of leaders produced is relatively small in a kingdom of millions.<br><br>President Kimball provided an answer to these questions as he illustrated the importance of the university to the Church educational system in his second-century address. In the early part of his speech, he referred to Principal Maeser's description of Brigham Young Academy as "the parent trunk of a great educational banyan tree" (in Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953], 73; quoted in Kimball, "Second Century," 244, with slightly different wording). President Kimball also noted that President David O. McKay had described BYU as "the hub of the Church educational wheel" and that others had referred to this institution as "the flagship." President Kimball then said:<br><br><i>However it is stated, the centrality of this University to the entire system is a very real fact of life. What I say to you, therefore, must take note of things beyond the borders of this campus, but not beyond its influence.</i>["Second Century," 244]<br><br>In this same light President Gordon B. Hinckley spoke to the priesthood of the Church in October 1999 regarding the importance of Brigham Young University. He began with the Lord's decree in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 78 to 80, which puts the Church under obligation "not only to learn of ecclesiastical matters but also of secular matters" ("Why We Do Some of the Things We Do,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 52). He then said, "We can accommodate only a relatively few. . . . The number who can be accommodated on campus is finite, but the influence of the university is infinite. Tremendous efforts are being made to enlarge and extend that influence." He pointed out that "the university has brought much favorable notice to the Church" through the quality of its academic and athletic programs. Also, the university "has become known for standards and ideals . . . which have let the world know of those things in which we believe" ("Why We Do," 52–53). Speaking of the various BYU campuses, he concluded by saying:<br><br><i>We shall keep these as flagships testifying to the great and earnest commitment of this Church to education, both ecclesiastical and secular, and while doing so prove to the world that excellent secular learning can be gained in an environment of religious faith.</i>[Hinckley, "Why We Do," 53]<br><br>As the Church has grown and the numbers accommodated by the university on campus have diminished in relative terms and can no longer take even "two of a city," the prophets have stated that the university is to be a model of profound spiritual and secular learning, a community known for high standards and ideals, a light whose special glow extends beyond campus borders, and an institution whose influence is infinite. The model is unique.<br><br>As I reflect on the words of the prophets, the aptness of Karl G. Maeser's banyan tree becomes clear. A banyan tree spreads by sending out aerial branches that reach down to the earth and become rooted as additional trunks. We are "the parent trunk," with three others in the form of BYU--Hawaii, BYU--Idaho, and the LDS Business College. We are at the heart of the Church Educational System with the responsibility of preparing teachers and providing learning materials. To the extent that we educate teachers and leaders in the seminary and institute programs, they are branches, and we extend our reach ecclesiastically.<br><br>The parent trunk consists of the 29,000 students gathered from all 50 states and more than 115 countries. In addition, 1,600 full-time and 600 part-time faculty assisted by 2,800 staff are also part of the tree. It is a community that speaks 85 languages and teaches more than 60. Overriding the many languages is one common language--that of the Spirit--which creates bonds that turn a diverse community into a unique university. The aerial branches of the parent are spreading carefully around the earth, touching down to bless LDS lives in distant places. BYU's influence spreads both secularly and spiritually through faculty and staff contact with peers, performing groups traveling the world, independent study programs, education days and weeks, and radio and television. The quality of BYU faculty and student research and creative work are making headlines almost weekly.<br><br>In today's world the spread of BYU's influence is accelerating as new technologies allow students anywhere in the world at any time to connect with us. This has helped fully matriculated students both on campus and in Study Abroad programs. In addition, Independent Study has grown from 35,000 off-campus students in 1996 to more than 100,000 in the current year. This has allowed the Division of Continuing Education to return to the university a substantial sum to support advances in the curriculum both on and off campus. BYU-TV, initiated in late 1999, now extends the campus reach to all states within the U.S. and to a large number of foreign countries. The branches and roots will expand the tree until it encompasses the earth. The tree will literally become a forest.<br><br>A strong trunk is essential if the branches and secondary roots are to receive quality nourishment. The parent trunk in Provo must be extraordinary both spiritually and secularly if the reach is to be infinite. In particular, it must be a part of "the true vine" (John 15:1) if it is to play a central role in the kingdom's educational system.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball hoped for the day when Brigham Young University and the Church Educational System would produce "brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, sculpture, painting, science, and in<i>all</i>the scholarly graces" ("Second Century," 247; emphasis added). His hopes and expectations are now coming to pass. Think of the numerous national and international awards received by our students, faculty, and staff during the past few years. From fine arts to the sciences, from humanities to business, from print to graphics to dining services, stars have arisen, and more will follow. Higher mountains and vistas still lie ahead, but this institution is beginning to lighten the sky. President Kimball's vision will be fulfilled as the university approaches more closely the model described by President Hinckley.<br><h2><b>Recent Trends</b></h2><br>In the 1978 Annual University Conference, President Dallin H. Oaks examined changes in the university over a 10-year period, from 1968 to 1978 (see Dallin H. Oaks, "Business and Report Message," Brigham Young University Annual Conference, 1978, 1–11). He noted that progress is almost undetectable on a year-by-year basis, but an extended period of time provides perspective. Today I believe a similar comparison using 1978 as a baseline will be instructive. It will help us appreciate the distance traveled during the past 23 years, help us understand where we are at present, and provide perspective for the future. The year 1978 provides an excellent comparative base because most of the growth in student numbers had taken place by then.<br><br>Student enrollments totaled 25,800 in 1978 and reached 27,000 by the early 1980s, when they were capped. Enrollments remained flat for a number of years but then were allowed to rise to 29,000 for a short time in the late 1980s. In 1997 the board of trustees formally approved an increase to 29,000 and provided additional faculty slots to support the increase. Consequently, the number of full-time students that increased 40 percent between 1968 and 1978 increased only 12 percent in the next 23 years. The percentage change in students is an important baseline for measuring growth in other areas.<br><br>The geographic origin of the students remained remarkably stable throughout the 23-year period. BYU students from Utah fluctuated around 30 percent, California's percentage ranged from 15 to 20 percent, students from the Intermountain states (excluding Utah) fluctuated around 25 percent, students from other parts of the U.S. averaged 20 percent, and foreign students were about 5 percent until this year, when it jumped to 7 percent. Approximately five years ago, in a speech to the Phi Kappa Phi Society, I indicated that the number of foreign students at BYU would grow, given Church growth outside the U.S. It was my impression then, however, that the growth would be slow for various reasons--the main one being economic. However, from last fall to this, the number of foreign students increased by one-third. One year does not a trend make, but foreign student admissions may begin to accelerate.<br><br>President Oaks noted in 1978 that enrollment growth in the prior 10-year period rose 32 percent whereas the number of graduates increased only 18 percent. Today the pattern is reversed. Although the growth in students is 12 percent during the past 23 years, the increase in graduates is 80 percent--increasing from 5,100 to 9,200. Especially significant is the growth in the number of female graduates, which has risen from less than 2,000 to more than 4,600--a jump of 130 percent. Males made up two-thirds of each graduating class 23 years ago. Today, female graduates slightly exceed their male counterparts with the percentages almost even. It is no longer a given that young women attending Brigham Young University will quit school when they marry. They are as determined to graduate as the men.<br><br>One of the most dramatic indicators of excellence is the quality of students enrolled. In 1978 entering freshmen had a grade point average of 3.4. Today the figure is almost 3.8. The average ACT score 23 years ago was 22.4; today the number is 27.4. As the Church continues to grow, the number of LDS students with high GPA and ACT scores will continue to climb. In another 20 years it is quite likely that the admissions pool could average a 3.9 GPA and 32 to 33 on the ACT. Given very high scores that provide little differentiation, other measures used to determine admission will become more important. It is imperative that the factors used in the process be improved.<br><br>Because of the generosity of the board of trustees and the additional funds gathered in the capital campaign, the number of full-time faculty increased 24 percent during this period--twice the percentage of increase in the student body. The student-faculty ratio dropped by two--from 21 to 19. The reduction is particularly important as we contemplate moving to a student-mentored learning environment, where students at the undergraduate level become engaged with faculty in research and creative projects. The number of LDS women with high-quality terminal degrees is increasing. Consequently, the percentage of women among new faculty hires has risen, averaging more than 30 percent in recent years.<br><br>One statistic that remained static during the period is the percent of faculty with PhDs. The figure was 70 percent in 1978 and is 72 percent today. President Oaks forecasted a nearly constant figure because there are a number of fields in which "a master's degree is the terminal degree" (Oaks, "Business and Report," AUC, 1978, 2). What has changed in the interim is the quality of faculty as measured by books published, the number of critically reviewed publications, juried and invited works, etc. Books published by BYU faculty in the late 1970s averaged 60 to 70 per year. Today the figure is above 200. Just in the last 10 years the number of juried, invited, and published creative works almost quadrupled, rising from 103 to 380. In the last five years the number of critically reviewed publications jumped 17 percent.<br><br>There is more space today per student and per employee than in 1978. Square footage on campus increased during the 23 years from 6 million to more than 8 million--a 33 percent increase. This is in contrast to the 12 percent rise in the number of students and the 24 percent addition to the faculty. Moreover, we are becoming more efficient in the use of space. The new Smith Building will be much more efficient than the current Smith Family Living Center and the other facilities it will replace. The 50-percent addition to the library is of extraordinary quality and an immense improvement to the learning environment. The addition and improvements to the Wilkinson Student Center provide adequate space for student services. The refurbishment of the Eyring Science Center created additional space and increased the utility of that building. The David O. McKay Building is now under renovation and will be much improved. The campus has never looked better--except for the hole in front of the Talmage Building. When completed, that underground, highly secured computer and telephone center will serve both BYU and the Church.<br><br>BYU Continuing Education enrollments continue to rise. President Oaks noted that registrations doubled in his 10-year period. Credit enrollments in 2001 are almost four times the 1978 number. In just the last five years, credit enrollments doubled--from 35,000 to 70,000. If one includes two new noncredit Web courses in family history, the number of Independent Study registrations will total 100,000 by the year's end. When Web courses were added in 1996, I thought paper-and-pencil enrollments would flatten and eventually fall due to increased use of the Web. In the five years that have elapsed, however, paper-and-pencil registrations for credit have risen 15,000, whereas Web enrollments have gone from zero to almost 20,000.<br><br>The funds provided by the board of trustees represent an enormous endowment for the university. There is no other educational institution in the world with a sponsor like ours, whether the measure is leadership or financial support. Church funding will continue to be the mainstay of the university for the foreseeable future. In addition, however, the board has seen fit to support us in raising additional funds for key purposes, including an endowment. All funds, both Church-appropriated plus donations, are treated as sacred, and expenditures are approved by the board. Donations to the university in the late 1970s averaged less than $10 million annually. At the beginning of the capital campaign in 1994, gift receipts totaled $20 to $25 million annually. Yearly donations during the campaign increased from $25 million to almost $100 million at the end of the campaign in 1999, and averaged $75 million for the five-year period. Development goals for the next five years are to provide funds for the new Joseph F. Smith Building, technology needs on campus, an indoor athletic practice facility, and support of the student-mentored learning program, as well as a number of other special needs.<br><h2><b>Commitment to Excellence</b></h2><br>Finally, there are challenges and opportunities for us to consider as we strive to build a house of profound learning. I firmly believe that Brigham Young University is a "school of destiny," but the fulfillment of prophetic vision requires that we lengthen our step. President Hinckley had a vision of 100 temples by the end of the century. The vision became a reality because of the planning and execution taken by him and others. Prophetic utterances become reality when people believe and act. Faith is necessary to ascend the higher mountains that lie ahead.<br><br>In "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," President Kimball quoted Ernest L. Wilkinson, editor of<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years:</i><br><br><i>To go to BYU is something special. There were Brethren who had dreams regarding the growth and maturity of Brigham Young University, even to the construction of a temple on the hill they had long called Temple Hill, yet "dreams and prophetic utterances are not self-executing. They are fulfilled . . . by righteous and devoted people making prophecies come true."</i>[In Kimball, "Second Century," 255–56; see also Wilkinson and Skousen,<i>School of Destiny,</i>876]<br><br>President Kimball spoke of this same principle. He said:<br><br><i>We must do more than ask the Lord for excellence. Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence. We must do more than pray for these outcomes at BYU, though we must surely pray. We must take thought. We must make effort. We must be patient. We must be professional. We must be spiritual. Then, in the process of time, this will become the fully anointed university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken in the past.</i>["Second Century," 253]<br><br>In what ways can we lengthen our stride, pick up the pace, and participate in creating a "fully anointed university of the Lord," a Zion of profound learning? There are five suggestions that I believe will make a difference over the next few years. The first is concerned with the spiritual aspects of our work, building a community. The others pertain to improvements in our approach to secular learning.<br><h3><strong><i>1. Building a Community</i></strong></h3><br>Are we of one heart and one mind? To what extent are we unified in our efforts to build a Zion on campus, to become a fully anointed university, to receive an endowment of power? Brigham Young University is unique among its peers. It is the only major university that has a chance of becoming an eternal educational institution, of having infinite influence. No other university of its stature has a faculty and staff that speak the distinctive language of the Spirit. No one else has access to the spiritual forces that transcend disciplinary ties found in departments and colleges. We have more in common with people in other departments than a signature on a paycheck. Most of us are here because we believe in the destiny of BYU.<br><br>In this light, there is one campus activity that I believe has the power to create a sense of Zion above all others. It is the Tuesday morning devotional. Other major universities invite their communities to one or two celebrations per year--a commencement. BYU is one of the few universities in the world that attempts to bring its entire community together on a weekly basis. Why do we do it? Is it just for counsel? If so, why not save an hour and read the speech on the Internet? I believe the major purpose of the devotional is to build a community, to expand our vision, and to recommit us to the quest.<br><br>In the recent alumni survey, former students were asked which activities had the most influence on their spiritual development at BYU. Respondents gave devotionals the highest ranking, followed by religion courses and BYU wards. I was surprised that devotionals came ahead of BYU wards, where students have an opportunity to participate actively in spiritual matters. I suspect the presence of prophets and apostles on occasion had some influence on their feelings. On the other hand, I believe that students became part of a larger community as they gathered with thousands of their peers and teachers to be spiritually taught. Devotionals helped them see the university and its role in the Church more clearly.<br><br>Gerrit Gong, a new member of the administration, recently told me about the commitment he made as a freshman student. During his first week on campus, he determined that he would not miss a devotional or a class during his time at BYU. He confessed that he missed four classes during the four years due to illness but attended every devotional.<br><br>I ask you to accept the following challenge. As faculty and staff, will you commit to attending every devotional that is within your power to attend? By attendance I refer to being in the Marriott Center. Will you help us build a sense of community by discussing the subject matter for a minute or two in classes or the workplace that day or the next? Will you share with students the sense of community we are trying to create and encourage them to become full partners in the community by attending devotionals? If you have administrative or supervisory responsibilities, will you encourage coworkers to become a part of this special hour?<br><br>Some have suggested that we force people to attend by making it a condition in the contract. Others have suggested that we return to giving credit to students who attend. We have rejected both suggestions because we are not interested in superficial orthodoxy. Our hope is that your commitment to prophetic vision will lead you here.<br><h3><strong><i>2. Continuous Reinvention</i></strong></h3><br>The second request concerns the need for ongoing reinvention in departments, colleges, and educational support units. I applaud the changes underway in biology and agriculture, engineering, and technology, in family and social sciences, education, business, fine arts, health and human performance, in printing and travel and numerous other units. Circumstances and needs change over time. If we want to add new subjects to the curriculum, we must be willing to drop others that may not be quite as important. If student loads shift from one department to another, we must be willing to rebalance if we believe the move is permanent and not temporary.<br><br>President Kimball pointed out 26 years ago that if Brigham Young University is "the flagship," then it must be willing to take "out all old planks as they decay and put in new and stronger timber in their place" to keep the ship seaworthy ("Second Century," 248).<br><h3><strong><i>3. Focusing Resources</i></strong></h3><br>The third suggestion concerns the need to focus resources. One of the dangers we face is attempting too many things. We are a community of 35,000, including students and employees. All are bright and creative. If everyone does his or her own thing, chaos will result. It is important that we channel our energies, select areas of opportunity unique to our interests, and build faculty teams in areas of strength where we can become world-class.<br><br>A strategic approach in a number of colleges has produced extraordinary results in a short period of time. The School of Family Life, the World Family Policy Center, and the Center for Religion and Freedom are examples. The Center for Remote Sensing and the Environmental Laboratory in the College of Engineering and Technology are windows through which the world can see extraordinary research being conducted at BYU.<br><br>With the addition of two supercomputers in the last two years, BYU's computer power ranks fifth in the nation among universities. The computers are being shared across campus by numerous departments, and undergraduate students as well as graduates are allowed access. A unique aspect of the computers is the creative excellence they are spawning. Faculty and students from various disciplines are doing world-class work as the computers save years of time in producing results.<br><br>The deans, department chairs, and heads of educational support units have accepted the challenge to focus resources to accelerate the quality of teaching and research across campus. This is an ongoing process. We hope in the planning, assessment, and budgeting activities we will identify key strategic areas where a concentration of resources will make a significant difference.<br><h3><strong><i>4. Student-Mentored Learning</i></strong></h3><br>The fourth suggestion pertains to student-mentored learning. Much has been said in recent months about this topic. The desire is to give most undergraduate students an opportunity to work with a faculty member on a research or creative work project. The culminating act is for the student to publish a paper or exhibit an important work. We believe that the number of students already having this opportunity is significant, but it is actually less than 20 percent.<br><br>Some funds have been made available through the academic vice president's office to seed such activities. We understand that more funds are needed. For example, additional research and teaching assistantships will be required. We know that technical support staff is inadequate and must be augmented. Student-mentored learning is one of the highest priorities on the development agenda. We will begin in the 2001–2002 school year to allocate some new monies from the endowment fund, including support for 10 new professorships.<br><br>Our challenge today is for departments to discuss these matters and determine the nature of the opportunities, what changes must be made to accommodate a student-mentored approach, and what resources are required. Our pledge is to work with you by providing the resources necessary to elevate learning to a new level.<br><h3><strong><i>5. Continual Curriculum Improvement</i></strong></h3><br>Finally, the last suggestion concerns continual improvement of the curriculum. Every faculty member must be a lifelong learner. An enormous investment has been made by each of you in the quest for a terminal degree. Further investment is required by the review process for rank and continuing status. Accrediting agencies now or soon will require further reviews of faculty productivity as long as you are employed by the university.<br><br>New technologies are available that have the potential of improving the learning process. Stephen Jones, assistant to the academic vice president, is making significant progress in identifying new tools, resolving problems that exist with current software, and organizing university resources to provide training for faculty. Presentations on new technologies will be given during the next few days.<br><br>Although we still have much to learn, it is becoming apparent that technology, if used appropriately, can enhance the learning process, increase student contact, and save faculty time. We encourage you to become familiar and determine the appropriateness of these technologies for your courses. Above all, curriculum improvement must be an ongoing process.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, Brigham Young University plays a central role in the educational process of the Church. BYU's destiny is to be a model of profound spiritual and secular learning with high standards and ideals. In the process of becoming the Lord's fully anointed university, its influence will become infinite.<br><br>Significant progress has been made on almost every front during the last 23 years as the university has matured significantly in terms of its spiritual and secular mission. Faculty and student quality is the highest in history, and the future looks even brighter.<br><br>For the university to achieve its destiny, there must be a sense of community, and devotionals play a critical role. Reinvention is an ongoing process and must continue. It is imperative that resources be focused in areas of strength and unique areas of interest. There is an opportunity to take the learning process to a new level through a student-mentored learning approach. Curriculum improvement in coming years must match the quality of students that will come.<br><br>Eventually the banyan tree will be transformed into a beautiful white tree with fruit that is delicious to the taste. The tree will shine as a standard for the nations because of its perfected dual nature. The light emanating from the tree will be of infinite power, and people will embrace the light and their knowledge will become perfect.<br><br>Most of us have planted the seed of the tree in our hearts. We have nourished the seed and it has sprouted. A swelling motion has told us that it is a good seed (see Alma 32:28–43). We do not know all things now, but if we continue we will become an integral part of the tree and enjoy its perfect light. May the Lord bless us to this end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<br>
Nothing so focuses the attention of those who work in a school as the knowledge that their students are about to arrive. On my first day of teaching in a university, I lost my appetite for breakfast. Heaven only knows what anxiety those who prepared the student housing and the bookstore and the classrooms felt. But this I know, from that first experience and the decades in education that have followed: You are all about to give laserlike attention to your tasks. Tunnel vision for you is not a weakness. At the start of school, it becomes a necessity.<br><br>Just before we put our heads down to get a closer view of the grindstone, it is useful to put a picture in our minds and hearts of where we are headed and why we are going there. That is easier to do here because living prophets of God have described our possibilities. To get ready for this year, I have studied two of those pictures of the future. One is from President George Albert Smith. The other is from President Spencer W. Kimball. The two views combine for me to make more clear what we should do and who we must become.<br><br>President George Albert Smith ended his remarks at the first dedication of the Eyring Science Center on October 17, 1950, with this prayer and blessing for us:<br><br><i>Oh, Father, bless the men and the women who are on the faculty of this great school that they may teach . . . under the influence of Thy Spirit, that they may be able to inspire the . . . men and women with the desire to be worthy to be called Thy children. Bless them that they may see the fruits of their labors, have joy when they have finished their work as instructors and leaders . . . that they may look back over a field, not of grain, not of vegetable, not of other things that people labor so hard for to keep us going here in mortality, but that they may look over a field of Thy sons and daughters who have been developed to be worthy to live with Thee.</i>[BYU Archives, UA 579]<br><br>That picture of our students worthy to live with God might have seemed to be in some distant future, in the world to come, if I had not next read this from President Kimball's second-century address (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>[Provo: BYU Press, 1976], 250–51):<br><br><i>We must not lose either our moorings or our sense of direction in the second century. We still have before us the remarkable prophecy of John Taylor when he observed:</i><br><br><i>"You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters. You mark my words, and write them down, and see if they do not come to pass."</i>[<i>JD</i>21:100]<br><br><i>Surely we cannot refuse that rendezvous with history because so much of what is desperately needed by mankind is bound up in our being willing to contribute to the fulfillment of that prophecy. Others, at times, also seem to have a sensing of what might happen. Charles H. Malik, former president of the United Nations General Assembly, voiced a fervent hope when he said that "one day a great university will arise somewhere--I hope in America--to which Christ will return in His full glory and power, a university which will, in the promotion of scientific, intellectual, and artistic excellence, surpass by far even the best secular universities of the present, but which will at the same time enable Christ to bless it and act and feel perfectly at home in it."</i>["Education in Upheaval: The Christian's Responsibility,"<i>Creative Help for Daily Living</i>21 (September 1970): 10; see<i>Brigham Young University: A School of Destiny,</i>Ernest L. Wilkinson and W. Cleon Skousen, eds. (Provo: BYU Press, 1976), xiii]<br><br>Malik spoke with certainty of a time when the Savior will return in glory to this earth. He described a place--a university--where the resurrected Lord would join with the students and the faculty and all who labor there. The Master will feel perfectly at home there.<br><br>That would seem beyond our reach if after reading this quote President Kimball had not then said: "Surely BYU can help to respond to that call!" ("Second Century," 251).<br><br>We know something of what a place must be like for the glorified Savior to feel perfectly at home. Of one thing we can be sure: those who labor there and all associated with it will have long before consecrated it to Him and to His kingdom.<br><br>His plan of redemption has always required men and women to consecrate all they have and all they are to the service of God. They covenant to do that. And then He tests them to see how sincere they are and how much they are willing to sacrifice. That test may be different for each of us, tailored for us alone, but it will be enough for the Master to prove our hearts.<br><br>Those who welcome Him at that university will have met and passed the tests. He will be at home, perfectly at home, because they will not only have said the words "This is the Lord's university," but they will have served and lived to make it so. They will have made it a consecrated place, offered it to Him, and in the process they will have been sanctified. What they will do to prove their consecration will have allowed the Atonement to change who they are.<br><br>A young student asked me a few days ago, "How do I know that the change made possible by the Atonement is happening in me?" The tears in her eyes and voice made me realize again how hard it is to recognize that change in ourselves. One way to know is that we are moving toward, not away from, consecration. I have seen evidence of that here.<br><br>I see it in the eyes of the students. I have seen it especially in the eyes of students who have been trusted with great responsibilities by you. Your remarkable courage to involve students in serious research, in leading service projects, and in caring for the campus has drawn from them sacrifice in time and effort beyond what was true just a few years ago. That is changing them, and it is changing this place.<br><br>One of the characteristics of a place where the Savior can come is that there will be no class of people that holds itself above another. Think of how foreign that is to the nature of most university life you have seen.<br><br>Yet you have enriched the learning of students by letting them share in your professional lives, in your research and writing, and in other responsibilities. But you have done far more. Students come poor in what they know about things you have worked years to understand. Yet you have welcomed undergraduates into your worlds as partners. That will give them powerful advantages when they go on to graduate school and to employment. But in the process of giving equal value to their contributions when they give all they have, you have changed this place. In the great day when the Master comes, the people will have "all things common" (Acts 2:44; 4:32) and there will be "no poor among them" (Moses 7:18). If I had not seen what I have seen here, I would not have thought that possible in universities, where rank and status have always been so carefully guarded.<br><br>There is another way in which I see an increase in consecration. I see more people who care about how much they can give the Master, almost forgetting to ask what they will get in return. A man was in my office the other day. He has just assumed a new title and a greater responsibility. Before he accepted, he forgot to ask about any change in salary. He had given his all as a teacher. He expected to give his all in his new position. His pay as a teacher was enough to meet his family's modest needs. And so he expressed great surprise that his pay was to increase.<br><br>His surprise told me something about him that he could not see. He had met and passed one of the tests of consecration. His giving his all was not for him a sacrifice, and so he ceased to calculate any expected return. He wasn't looking sidewise to see what others in comparable positions received or what he might get for himself in another place. Instead of looking to the side, he was looking up. And so he was changing the place he was in. I realize that such an attitude is rare. But it is becoming less rare here.<br><br>It is not only those who work and study here who are consecrating this place. I was with members of the Church in Latin America the last two weekends. There I met tithe payers, full-tithe payers, who struggle for economic survival. One great leader, a medical doctor, lost his employment for months. To feed his family, he turned to the manual work he had done to put himself through medical school. He had borrowed to get food. The loan was coming due, and he saw no way to pay it. And yet through it all, week by week, he paid tithing on his tiny earnings. He did not ask me for money but asked that I would pray for him. His only concern was that God would help him to keep his covenants.<br><br>I thought of you and this place as I listened to him. He will never come here. His children will never come here, nor will the blessings of this university likely reach them. But his tithes, combined with the offerings of millions of covenant Saints across the earth, come to this place because the Lord trusts and blesses us. I can see only dimly His purposes in making us so dependent on tithing, but surely those purposes include the humbling of those who receive as well as His exalting the poor for their keeping their promise of consecration.<br><br>All of the sources of funding for this university help to make it a consecrated place. The tithing comes mostly from members of modest means. Other funding comes from donations. You have heard much of the success of our capital campaign. If you knew the donors as I do, you would know that what appear to be gifts coming out of affluence frequently require great sacrifice and consecration. I remember a luncheon with a man and his large family. He had in his early years promised the Lord that any surplus would go to the kingdom of God. Now the married children gathered as the father and the mother gave away what in any other family might have been seen as the very large and rightful inheritance of the children. I remember that luncheon every time I am tempted to say, "Well, we can always pay it out of the endowment," as if somehow those funds were less precious and less the Lord's.<br><br>The same mistake can be made with that part of our funding that comes from students and their families. I had a man push his finger in my chest once to convince me that it was a stupid thing not to raise the tuition dramatically. He talked about how far behind we were in tuition compared to schools he judged inferior to ours. He said it was wrong to give such a bargain to rich families and that we could always use the excess revenues to give scholarships to those who were poor.<br><br>One evidence that this is becoming a consecrated place is that most of you sense something wrong in those words. In a place where the Savior can come, the poor will be exalted. They will have the chance for education. It will be funded by consecrated offerings, not out of "excess revenues." And costs will be less--far less--because those who provide the education will treat all funds as sacred.<br><br>And where the tuition is beyond the means of the poor, whatever they need in aid they will be trusted to pay back to benefit those who follow. We can be confident that the poor with training can lift themselves to bless others and thereby decrease their feelings that they are helpless victims and increase their sense of dignity as children of God. They can be led away from selfishness and toward consecration.<br><br>The journey toward being a consecrated place is a long one. We have not arrived, but we are moving on the path. Those everyday tasks to which you now will give your all--because you give your all--are changing this school, and they are allowing the Lord to make a change in you. There will be tests ahead--not because God doubts us but because He loves us. I have every confidence that we will pass the tests and that surely BYU will respond to the call to be a consecrated place, as President Smith and President Kimball knew we would.<br><br>I leave you my blessing. I bless you that you will in the days ahead see evidence of increased consecration in your students, in your families, in your colleagues, and in yourselves, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1> Peace - A 9/11 Message - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This morning, as most of you know, one of the greatest tragedies that has occurred on the mainland of the United States took place. Thousands of lives have been lost, and thousands have been injured. The most important counsel that we can give this morning, I believe, is threefold.<br><br>The first is there is no reason to fear for our lives or the lives of our loved ones if they weren't in those towers or the Pentagon. We suspect the terrorists are hoping for panic. With the exception again of the Pentagon and the World Trade Center, we believe there are no other areas of danger.<br><br>Second, it is extremely important that we be respectful of all people. When the Oklahoma City federal building was bombed, there was considerable speculation early on as to who might have been responsible. In the end those speculations were incorrect. We ask all of you to be respectful of every single person that you meet and contact here on campus and elsewhere.<br><br>Third, the best news of all is the good news. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ. Even though we live in troubled times--and prophets have indicated that there will be turmoil in the last days--it is possible for each of us to feel peace, to have the peace of the gospel in our lives. We believe that is the most important message we have for the world.<br><br>We are part of the greatest peaceful mission this earth has ever known. The 60,000 missionaries and 11 million members of the Church have the only message that gives hope for peace. And peace will not come in the lives of people until they have internalized the message of the Master.<br><br>Let me turn to the words of the Savior. At the Last Supper, after finishing the meal, the Savior and his disciples sang the Hallel. The words of the Hallel are from Psalms 113 to 118. Chapters 113 through 116 are sung before the meal, in which thanks are given to God for the deliverance from Egypt; chapters 117 and 118 are sung after the Passover meal. I invite you today to read those chapters in Psalms. Those chapters talk about being saved from death. They are talking about the Atonement. So, at the Last Supper with His eleven disciples--Judas having left and Jesus knowing where he was going--Jesus is then singing about His own death.<br><br>In that setting He went on to talk to His disciples about the most precious gift He had to give them. That gift was the gift of the Holy Ghost. These are His words: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:26).<br><br>And then He said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you" (John 14:27).<br><br>He knows where He is going, and there is peace in His heart. He knows He is going to the garden, and He is going to the cross. He is telling them He is leaving them His peace.<br><br>"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, that is our message this morning. Fortunately this is only the second act of a three-act play. Even when death comes to those we love, we know what lies ahead. We know they are fine. It is those of us who are left behind who are sad. We know we will see them again, and we know we will be with them. When death comes to someone who has the peace of the Holy Ghost inside, it can be sweet, not bitter.<br><br>Do you understand why you young people hold the power of peace for the world in your hands? The world depends on you.<br><br>Many of you have just returned from missions; many of you will go next year. The world's peace is on your shoulders because you have the only message that gives hope for eternal peace. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was the president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given at a special prayer meeting on 11 September 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Purity, Learning: Lay Hold On &quot;Every Good Thing&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Elder Bateman:</b>We welcome you to the first, official devotional of the 2001–2002 school year. We welcome a television audience that stretches across the United States and around the earth via satellite. One week ago Sister Bateman and I were prepared to address this same forum when tragedy struck New York City and the Pentagon. The events of that day have had an impact not only on the United States but on the entire world. Most governments now realize that no one is safe if terrorists are allowed free rein to develop secret networks and plan strikes against innocent people. It reminds one of the Gadianton robbers, who lived in a day long ago. The Book of Mormon indicates that they were experts in wickedness, lived in the wilderness, operated through secret combinations in the settled parts of the land, and were difficult to find and destroy (see Helaman 2:4, 11; 3:23). Could there be a more apt description of the enemy we are now facing?<br><br>The past week has sobered everyone and caused us to reflect on the sanctity of life. The tragedy has made clear that, for many, the most important aspect of life is found in family relationships. In the midst of the rubble, rescuers have uncovered the dead clutching family photos. One man who escaped from the crashing towers indicated how grateful he was that he could hug his children one more time. The last words heard from a husband to his wife were "I love you!" And then there are men and women, young and old, waiting near the crash sites displaying pictures of their loved ones and hoping for a miracle. Someone has said that God will turn the evil into good. If the citizens of this and other nations recognize their frailties and turn to God for help, good will be the outcome.<br><br>However, experience indicates that transformations are seldom permanent unless one is deeply touched by the Holy Spirit. I repeat my statement from last week: "You young people hold the power of peace for the world in your hands. The world depends on you." Christ depends on you. The message of the Master must be written in your hearts so that you may extend it to others. Christ's healing power is more than physical. He has the power to make a person whole, to heal the soul as well as the body. The magnificent painting by Carl Heinrich Bloch of<i>Christ Healing the Sick at the Pool of Bethesda</i>portrays Christ both as a healer and a comforter. The original painting, a wonderful gift, has just arrived on campus and will be the signature piece for the Museum of Art. We hope it will be a constant reminder of our heritage and our mission.<br><br>Sister Bateman and I approach this occasion with concern, knowing and feeling the responsibility that is ours to teach and uplift. The theme we have chosen is taken from the seventh chapter of Moroni, wherein Mormon explains that "the Spirit of Christ is given to every [person], that [they] may know good from evil" (Moroni 7:16). Mormon then counsels the Nephites to "search diligently in the light of Christ . . . and . . . lay hold upon every good thing" (Moroni 7:19).<br><br>Given the events of last week, we wish to discuss the opportunity that you have to search in the light and to lay hold upon good things that bring lasting happiness. As young adults you are in the midst of the most critical decision-making period of life. It is important that you have the light and faith to make right decisions, to discern good from evil, to hold onto and develop the things that the Lord has in store for you. It is interesting that Satan offered Adam and Eve the opportunity to know good and evil (see Genesis 3:5). In contrast, Mormon indicates the purpose of mortality is to help us to "know good<i>from</i>evil" (Moroni 7:19; emphasis added). One can know evil without tasting it.<br><br>BYU provides an opportunity for you to achieve this aim. It represents an opportunity to search in the light. It is a community of enlightened people, both intellectually and spiritually. The environment is shaped by people of character, people who are honest, people who have made right choices. It is an ideal place to pursue Mormon's injunction.<br><br>Let us show a Minerva Teichert painting called<i>Lehi's Dream</i>that illustrates the importance of making right choices. The painting is of Lehi's dream of the tree of life. I would like to draw your attention to the large and spacious building with its gold dome, statues, and multitudes of people. One would think that it is the most important symbol in Lehi's dream. Even though it is in the background of the painting, it is so bright and inviting that it commands attention and attempts to overshadow other parts of the story. The building rises up from the water having no foundation, and a careful examination reveals that blue sky pierces the open door and windows. As Professor John Welch and Doris Dant note, "The great building is merely a facade with the sky showing through the door and windows, appropriate for a symbol of the pride and 'vain imaginations' of the world (1 Nephi 12:18)" (John W. Welch and Doris R. Dant,<i>The Book of Mormon Paintings of Minerva Teichert</i>[Provo: BYU Studies; Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997], 60). In reality the building is a deceitful sham, a storefront with nothing below it, above it, or behind it. It is the empty life with nothing of value in it. And it represents the pride of the world.<br><br>However, the real story is in the foreground. It is the pathos of a family struggling to hold onto good things, to find their way to the tree of life and to partake of its fruit. Two sons have left the safety of the path and iron rod, whereas others continue the journey. The tree is a symbol for Christ, and the fruits of the tree are the blessings of His Atonement. You will note in the painting that the tree is not highlighted. It is off to the side and in the shadow of the building. Sister Teichert knew that in life it is easier to follow the crowd and the ways of the world than it is to discipline one's appetites along the strait and narrow road to life. As Jesus said:<br><br><i>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</i><br><br><i>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</i>[Matthew 7:13–14]<br><br>With the painting as a figurative metaphor, what are the good things you can grasp and internalize while at Brigham Young University? There are three good things that we challenge you to lay hold upon and incorporate in your lives. The first is to make a commitment to build an eternal family and thereby establish your eternal identity. The second is to maintain your personal purity. The third is to learn by study and by faith. Sister Bateman will discuss the first objective.<br><br><b>Sister Marilyn S. Bateman:</b>Let me add my welcome to President Bateman's. For the last 42 years my major interest and focus have been the creation of an eternal family. I believe it is the most important mission a man or woman can pursue. When one realizes that Heavenly Father's work and glory is to raise and educate children, one can understand why I believe that my work has been in partnership with Him and why it is the most exciting work on earth. If earthly parents are wise and desire a fullness of joy, they will strive to emulate our heavenly parents. Many of the lessons needed in this life and in the next are learned in the family setting. That is why I determined many years ago to focus my energies on the greatest calling of all--to be a mother, wife, and daughter in Zion. I recognize that not all have the opportunity in this life to be a mother or father. But everyone is a son or daughter, and most are a sister or brother, an aunt or uncle. Everyone plays a role in an earthly family, and everyone may build an eternal family.<br><br>My subject today centers on the family. Some of you, the freshmen in particular, may feel that the decisions regarding a companion and starting a family are a few years away. But you are an important part of your parents' family, and the choices you make today and in the near future will affect personal family decisions later. For others in the audience, spousal and parental decisions are already upon you.<br><h2><b>Build Eternal Families</b></h2><br>Minerva Teichert's painting of the tree of life reminds us of the importance of having a vision of what life can be. This includes the vision of a family in the eternities. It is important to set goals, establish priorities, and then "hold fast [to] that which is good" (Thessalonians 5:21). The painting illustrates the importance of family relationships and the challenges that can come. The family of Lehi and Sariah, depicted in the painting, is a type for all families. Lehi and his family's journey to the promised land is symbolic of our journey through life. Our ultimate goal is to obtain an inheritance in the heavenly city. In the Minerva Teichert painting, Lehi is inviting his family to come to the tree and partake of the fruit of eternal life. He is inviting them to come to Christ and build an eternal family. The decision regarding one's spouse is the second-most important decision in life. It is second only to the decision to follow Christ.<br><br>Sisters, suppose you have found a wonderful companion and then one day he arrives home from work and announces that the family should leave for the desert. Your nice home and all that is in it will be left behind, and you will live in a tent for eight years. He asks you to organize the children and bring the scriptures, a few clothes, and some food. What would your answer be? Suppose your husband indicates that an angel has appeared to him and has told him to leave! Would your answer change? Brothers and sisters, trust between husband and wife is a most valuable possession. Living the gospel together is your only protection. Find a companion who will live the gospel and be worthy of your trust!<br><br>Husbands, suppose the day comes when you have a dream and your wife agrees to support you. But the dream takes longer to fulfill than you expected, and there are trials along the way. Again, living the gospel and focusing on an eternal family will sustain you in life's trials.<br><br>The painting illustrates the tender feelings that parents have for children and how anxious they are to have all of them complete the journey. Most of us are familiar with the story and are aware of the conflict that exists. Laman and Lemuel rejected the counsel of their parents. But Nephi and Sam learned for themselves that their father spoke the truth (see 1 Nephi 2:16). In spite of the expressions of love and the pleadings to "rebel no more" (2 Nephi 1:24), Laman and Lemuel chose the ways of the world.<br><br>In the painting the prophet Lehi has arrived at the tree and has partaken of the fruit. Holding to the rod with one hand, he offers fruit in the other and invites his family to come and partake. Sariah, the mother, is in the foreground, almost overcome with both joy and sadness. First, dropping to her knees in a sign of humility, she recognizes the tree as a symbol for Christ. Second, she sees Laman and Lemuel in a small boat making their way to the large and spacious building. In the process of losing two sons, she pleads with them to return while pointing to the tree. Nephi, feeling Sariah's sorrow, holds the rod in one hand and reaches down with the other to help his mother. How important it is for children to support their parents!<br><br>Family relationships are important and crucial to a child's development. Children need parents and parents need children. Brothers and sisters play a vital role in the faithfulness of other siblings. Sister Teichert illustrates the importance of one brother strengthening another by showing Sam holding onto Nephi. In contrast, Laman and Lemuel do not provide leadership for their brothers and sisters. As Lehi learned of Laman and Lemuel's fate through the dream, he "feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord" (1 Nephi 8:36). Nevertheless he continued to counsel and work with them. As a parent he never gave up on his children. The scripture reads, "And he did exhort them . . . with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words" (1 Nephi 8:37). Parents never give up.<br><br>Family relationships are sacred. The bonds within families have spiritual roots. We know that we lived as brothers and sisters before coming to earth. More important, we are aware that families formed on earth can be eternal. The doctrine that eternal life is familial is one of the unique teachings of our church. Families are welded together by covenant in love and service to each other. As Nephi is reaching out to assist his mother, he is demonstrating sympathy and understanding for her grief. Love is a spiritual gift and comes from the light within us. It is expressed through the service we render. Christ's life is the epitome of service and reflects His love for everyone. Families are built through service: parents to children early in life and then children to parents later. President Spencer W. Kimball said, "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another mortal that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other" (<i>TSWK,</i>252).<br><br>And the mortals who serve us are often in the family. A few experiences in my life have taught me the truth of President Kimball's statement. I know that Heavenly Father is aware of families and that He will prompt one family member to meet the needs of another. Some years ago the Lord helped me in a time of trial as He directed our family in the support of my parents. More than 20 years ago President Bateman and I lived in New Jersey with our children. My parents lived in Provo. My father was in very poor health.<br><br>At the time my husband was working for a large, multinational firm and had just been promoted to a senior position. In the previous three years we had moved from Utah to England and then to Pennsylvania. Now the new assignment was causing us to move again, this time to New Jersey. It was the third move in three years. The children had patiently accompanied us, establishing new friends each year. We bought a new home in a beautiful area of the state and settled down for what we hoped would be a long stay. We had no desire to move again.<br><br>We had been in New Jersey only a few months when BYU President Dallin Oaks called and asked my husband to serve as dean of the School of Management. Neither of us felt that another move was appropriate. The children were adjusting to their new environment, President Bateman was happy in his work, we had just received callings in the ward and stake, and the neighbors were becoming friends. Consequently we declined the offer. During the next few months President Oaks contacted President Bateman on a number of occasions and asked if there was any chance that he might change his mind. After the third or fourth time, the Spirit touched my husband, and he knew that we should accept the BYU position and return to Provo. Even though I agreed to the move, I was uneasy and concerned for the children. Although I prayed for peace regarding the move, no confirmation came, and I wondered about the change.<br><br>One night a few weeks before we were to leave for Provo, I had a dream that awakened me in the middle of the night. In the dream I was terribly upset because my father was dying and I was unable to return home. I woke up my husband and related the dream to him. After some discussion we felt that it was the Lord's way of assuring me that the decision to move was right.<br><br>A few weeks later we arrived in Provo, where we were glad to be with our parents again. We enjoyed spending time with them and renewing family relationships. One month after our arrival we were visiting my parents when my dad began having chest pains. Mother hurriedly took him to the hospital. By evening he was gone. The experience of losing a parent is traumatic. I will never forget the sadness I felt, but I remembered the dream and now more fully understood its meaning and purpose. The month prior to my father's death was an important time for our children to become reacquainted with their grandfather and for President Bateman and me to express our love and support for both Dad and Mom. It was also important that we were there to support my mother in a time of great need. In the months that followed, our appreciation for the Lord deepened as we knew He was aware of us and had prompted us to change our course. As with Lehi and Sariah, He was willing to help in the building of an eternal family.<br><br>Family relationships are sacred and are meant to be eternal. Each person in a family is important, as evidenced by last week's disaster. Each person is needed to complete the family circle. The absence of a person may leave a huge crater in the hearts of family members.<br><br>Hold tightly to the iron rod. Pray that you might discern good from evil. Build strong family ties. Keep in contact with your parents and grandparents. We love you. We are grateful you are here. Work hard, be prayerful, stay faithful, and have fun. We pray that you will always "search diligently in the light of Christ" and "lay hold upon every good thing." I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Elder Merrill J. Bateman:</b>I am grateful for Sister Bateman's role in our family. She has a sixth sense when it comes to building relationships. We now have 25 grandchildren. Someone asked my wife a short time ago if she knew all of their names. She was stunned and surprised by the question. Not only does she know their names, birthdays, and upcoming events concerning them, she has a personal relationship with each one. After all, they are her children, too. Whenever grandchildren visit our home, they head for the library to find Grandma, who is often reading. It is wonderful to see them embrace her and for Sister Bateman to gather the little ones in her arms. She plans family events that bring grandparents, children, and grandchildren together to build relationships. Remember, when you form your family, find ways to bind your children and grandchildren to you. And at this stage of your life, spend time with parents and grandparents before it is too late. The greatest good on this earth and in eternity is the family.<br><br>You are at a critical juncture in life. Your temporal dependence on parents is diminishing, but do not let the spiritual links weaken. As President Hinckley noted in a recent BYU devotional, you must "never become a weak link in the chain of your family's generations" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Keep the Chain Unbroken,"<i>BYU 1999–2000 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 2000], 111).<br><h2><b>Personal Purity</b></h2><br>Now I come to the second challenge. The creation of an eternal family depends on personal purity. This earth was created for three major purposes. The first was to allow us, God's spirit children, to obtain a physical body. The second was to test our obedience to eternal laws. The third was to create an eternal family. The three purposes are linked. You cannot accomplish the third--i.e., an eternal family--without achieving the first two. On occasion while teaching a religion class, I have asked students why it is necessary to have a body. Generally the answer is "to become like God." I then ask, "Why does God have a body?" Often there is silence, suggesting they do not know.<br><br>The physical body is essential to the creation of life. As spirit children we could not form families of our own. We did not have the power. The seeds of life are in the physical tabernacle. Perhaps that is an additional reason why our bodies are called the temple of God. Paul stated that the physical body is a temple of God because it is a house for the Holy Ghost (see 1 Corinthians 6:19–20). The sacred power of creation is given to us for a relatively short time--for only a few decades--and then removed. We are given laws and tested to see if we will respect this power, protect its use, and respect the body. If we are obedient, the power of life returns in the Resurrection. If we abuse the power and do not repent, the natural capacity to create never returns, and we live singly in the eternities (see D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4).<br><br>In a classic devotional here a few years ago, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland gave three reasons why sexual intimacy must be saved for marriage. In order to appreciate the reasons, one must understand the sacredness of life. The giving and taking of life are sacred parts of the Lord's plan. Sexual sin is second only to murder (see Alma 39:5). As Elder Holland states:<br><br><i>Clearly God's greatest concerns regarding mortality are how one gets into this world and how one gets out of it. These two most important issues . . . He . . . wishes most to reserve to Himself. These are the two matters that He has repeatedly told us He wants us never to take illegally, illicitly, unfaithfully, without sanction.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland,<i>Of Souls, Symbols, and Sacraments</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2001), 6–7]<br><br>Given the sacredness of life, the first reason that sexual purity is so important relates to the doctrine of the soul. We are taught that "the spirit<i>and</i>the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15; emphasis added). And, in Elder Holland's words:<br><br><i>When one toys with the God-given . . . body of another, he or she toys with the very soul of that individual, toys with the central purpose and product of life. . . . In trivializing the soul of another . . . we trivialize the atonement, which saved that soul and guaranteed its continued existence</i>. [<i>Of Souls,</i>13]<br><br>The second reason is that human intimacy is a sacred "symbol of total union" (p. 17). Eternal marriage is intended to be a "welding" together, an "unbreakable union" (p. 17). The physical relationship is an expression of a deeper spiritual bond. There is a "moral duplicity that comes from pretending we are one" when covenants have not been made (p. 19).<br><br>The final reason for moral purity given by Elder Holland is that "sexual union is . . . a sacrament of the highest order, a union not only of a man and a woman but very much the union of that man and that woman with God" (p. 29).<br><br>Do you see the links between personal purity and eternal families? Please understand how important it is not to swim in the river of filthy water seen by Nephi. As sure as the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico, so the river of filth flows into the "gulf of misery" (see 1 Nephi 15:27–28; 2 Nephi 1:13). Commit to lay hold upon a life of personal purity that you may have the power to build an eternal family.<br><h2><b>Learn by Study and by Faith</b></h2><br>Finally, I encourage you to dedicate yourselves to a lifetime of learning in the light--to learn by study and by faith. The most important function of Brigham Young University is to provide you with an enlightened environment. I have heard some complain--primarily people outside the Church--that this campus does not provide enough choice. Since choice is made possible by opposites, the logical conclusion of their statement is that there is too much light at BYU and not enough darkness. They seem to suggest that we "search in the dark"--at least part of the time--to prepare for the "real" world. Last week's events suggest that there is enough evil in the world without inviting it into our lives. Moreover, Mormon's words suggest that the presence of evil is not necessary for one to make good choices.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that temptation can find a person anywhere. Satan's work knows few boundaries. He has a long history of playing with the emotions and physical desires of young people. He will tempt you in your relationships, through television, movies, magazines, the Internet, and e-mail. He knows how to invade your apartments and homes. He will not forget you!<br><br>So, regardless of where you are, search in the light. It is better to search in the light of day assisted by knowledgeable friends than at night with Lucifer holding the flashlight. From my perspective, this campus is an enormous opportunity for young people to learn from the experience of others, to explore new ideas, to be supported by colleagues who desire only the best. It is a blessing to be surrounded by good people when making eternal decisions.<br><br>In the end, the opportunity to acquire spiritual knowledge at BYU will depend on your sensitivity to the Spirit. This type of learning cannot be forced. The Lord will determine the time and place. If you are diligent, new truths will enter your mind and heart, you will "feel pure intelligence flowing into you," there will be "sudden strokes of ideas . . . presented unto your minds," and you will have been taught by the Holy Spirit (Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings,</i>151).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we have an opportunity to move to new levels--intellectually and spiritually--by heeding Mormon's admonition. We are building an institution of infinite influence where one may search in the light and lay hold upon good things.<br><br>In light of the recent tragedy, the words of President Harold B. Lee seem appropriate. In a memorable devotional talk called "Have Faith in America," given on October 26, 1973, at Ricks College, President Lee said:<br><br><i>Men may fail in this country, earthquakes may come, seas may heave beyond their bounds, there may be great drought, disaster, and hardship, but this nation, founded on principles laid down by men whom God raised up, will never fail. This is the cradle of humanity, where life on this earth began. . . . This is the place of the new Jerusalem. This is the place that the Lord said is favored above all other nations. . . . Yes, . . . men may fail, but this nation won't fail.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Ye Are the Light of the World</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), 350–51; see also L. Brent Goates,<i>Harold B. Lee: Prophet and Seer</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1985), 557–59]<br><br>May we be true to the Light and to the principles of freedom, justice, and mercy is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>BYU President Merrill J. Bateman and his wife, Marilyn S. Bateman gave this devotional address on 18 September 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ht of the World - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Have you ever picked up a fully loaded pack at the start of a really long hike? It is almost staggering as you try and throw it on your shoulders and secure it to your frame. However, once you get it adjusted on your back and hit your hiking stride, it may still be heavy but you are able to manage.<br><br>Well, school has started. You have had four weeks to get into the swing of things. Initially your class load, your work schedule, your social life, and your family and church responsibilities all considered together might have appeared a bit too much. By now, though, many of you have adjusted to your load. But some of you have not. For some of you, juggling all the aspects of your life is a challenge. And just when you think you have got your pack adjusted, a little weight gets added.<br><br>It turns out that each of us has at one time or another felt--or will feel--the weight of the world on our shoulders. My purpose today is to remind us that we are not involved in a weight-lifting competition to determine whose world weighs the most. Instead, we are involved in the competition of helping others to lift the weight of their world when it becomes unbearable.<br><br>I am a Gospel Doctrine teacher in my ward. This year I have come to appreciate the struggles that the early Saints endured so that I might enjoy the many blessings of the gospel. I often wonder how they were able to go on in the face of such oppression and opposition. Imagine this: In 1831 a group of Saints leave the comfort of their homes in the state of New York and head for Kirtland, Ohio, only to be told that they are to go to Jackson County, Missouri. Jackson County was then the wild frontier. The Saints buy land, clear it, build houses, and plant crops. All is well--for a couple of years. Then they are forced out. Off they go across the Missouri River to Clay County, where they buy land, clear it, build houses, and plant crops. All is well--for a couple of years. Then they are forced out. Then off they go to Far West, where they buy land, clear it, build houses, and plant crops. In March 1838 the Prophet Joseph Smith joins them from Kirtland. Finally, all is well--for six months--until Governor Boggs issues the extermination order. The Prophet is arrested almost immediately and eventually ends up in Liberty Jail, where he spends approximately four months.<br><br>While the Prophet was imprisoned, what was happening to the Saints? About 8,000 members of the Church were run out of their homes and forced to flee to Illinois. The anguished prayer offered by Joseph Smith during that period is found in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. That prayer reflects the same feelings shared by people around the world in the wake of last month's terrorist attacks.<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them? . . .</i><br><br><i>Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies; and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword avenge us of our wrongs.</i><br><br><i>Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3, 5–6]<br><br>One can sense in the Prophet's pleas his despair and his frustration. His followers were being exterminated--or, if they were lucky, simply driven to a swamp in Illinois--and he could do absolutely nothing to help. Joseph felt the weight of the world on his shoulders--and that was a lot of weight. President Bush has felt a similar weight this past month as he has sought to lead the United States--and the world--in a civilized response to the uncivilized attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C.<br><br>Fortunately for us, we are not expected to carry the weight of a prophet's world or a president's world. I am grateful for that. My world is heavy enough, as, I am sure, is yours. Still there are times when the weight of my world gets heavier as challenges come. In times like those I am grateful for the help heaven sends that allows me to carry on. And I am grateful for people who are sensitive to the promptings of the Spirit and who help me with my load in my times of need.<br><br>I would like to share with you several experiences from the scriptures and from my life that illustrate how worlds can get heavy and how we can, with heaven's help, assist other people by lightening their loads. Some of the examples that I will describe will seem very small, especially when compared with the suffering of the Saints in Missouri or that of the victims in New York. But the examples I will share were not small to the participants. My message is not one of comparing burdens. It is about sharing burdens and not judging the severity of someone else's trial.<br><br>I have a six-year-old daughter named Cierra. She is the youngest of our seven children. Her favorite thing to do is play dress-up with her friends. When I walk into the house, I never know what my role is to be. She, with her friends Madison and Bethany, may be Snow White or Ariel or Jasmine or Sleeping Beauty--otherwise known as Princess Aurora--and I may instantly be called on to be Prince Eric or King Triton or Gaston or the wicked Jafar. I must always be on my toes because these girls take their game seriously. They don't like it when an amateur messes up his lines.<br><br>I went into Cierra's room at the end of a recent hard day of playing dress-up. It looked like a Disney Store had exploded. There were outfits everywhere, with props all over the place. I went in search of the princess because someone was going to clean up this mess, and that someone was not going to be me. I found Cierra and calmly explained to her the situation and my concern. She immediately understood and headed to her room to take care of the problem. After five minutes I went to her room--her still messy room--to find her playing with her Barbies. I asked what she was doing, and she said, as though I was a bit slow, "I'm playing Barbies."<br><br>"But, Cierra," I said, "I thought you were going to clean up this room."<br><br>She said to me, "But, Daddy, there is too much stuff out. Besides, I didn't make this whole mess by myself."<br><br>I then explained to her that she should have thought of that when she and her friends were making the mess. "Now clean up this mess," I sternly declared.<br><br>I went back every five minutes or so to make sure she was staying on task, and, bless her heart, she kept trying. But the mess was too big for her. After all, three little girls together make a much bigger mess than three little girls individually. There is some synergy there.<br><br>After a half-hour of periodically checking on her and verbally poking her to keep her working, I again went into her room only to find her lying on her bed with her back to the door. I marched over to the bed thinking she had gone to sleep. How dare she do that! Just as I reached down to turn her over, she rolled back and, with big, tear-filled brown eyes, said, "Daddy, it's too hard."<br><br>The weight of a six-year-old's world can get very heavy--to a six-year-old. She did not want to hear me say, "I could clean this room up in five minutes" or "When I was your age . . ." At that moment the weight was too much, and she needed relief. So Prince Eric picked her up, and he, together with Princess Ariel, cleaned up the castle. It didn't take much effort on my part to lighten a load that to her had become too heavy.<br><br>Recall from the Book of Mormon the story of Alma the Elder and Abinadi. Alma believed the words of the prophet Abinadi, and he then himself became a mighty prophet. In one of his sermons by the Waters of Mormon, Alma detailed the characteristics of one who desires to come into the fold of God and be baptized:<br><br><i>Ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death.</i>[Mosiah 18:8–9]<br><br>Baptism is an outward ordinance signifying a change that occurs on the inside. Alma taught that true followers of Jesus Christ should demonstrate a willingness "to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light." Sometimes it is as easy as helping to pick up a messy room. In fact, I would argue that, in many cases, lightening the load of someone else is easy--because it is their load. The burden is not weighing us down. If we are earnestly striving to do God's will, He will often direct us to those who might need our help, and He will inspire us as to what we might do--if we are paying attention. And sometimes Heavenly Father takes matters into His own hands and does what needs to be done when others can't do it.<br><br>Let me share with you a brief missionary story. Our oldest son J.D. (our number-two child) is 19 years old. He was called on a mission and assigned to serve in the Peru Lima North Mission. He was to spend three weeks in the Provo MTC and then head to the MTC in Lima for six weeks. When we left him at the MTC here in Provo, we left him knowing that in three weeks we would see him at the airport. My dear wife had spent 19 years raising this young man. For 19 years, raising him was her full-time job. When she put him in the MTC, she was forced into a kind of retirement. No longer would she be right there to help him solve his problems or, in those instances when he was the problem, help him to see what he could do better. Now he was out of her reach, and so she, like all mothers, worried. And because he was her first missionary, she worried all the more.<br><br>She regularly sent letters and care packages to the MTC, and on occasion she would drive by the MTC in hopes of perhaps catching a glimpse of her missionary. I should note that she never got his schedule so that she could time things just right--after all, that would have been against the rules. She would just randomly drive by the MTC, and she would consistently strike out. She saw everyone else's missionary, but she never saw hers. But that was okay, because after three weeks she would see him at the airport.<br><br>Then we got the phone call telling us that the hoped-for reunion was not to be. Visa problems would prevent his leaving on time. Three weeks would stretch to nine weeks. It's not a long time, but when your heart is set on seeing your missionary on a certain day, what a disappointment it is to find out it just isn't going to happen.<br><br>On the day J.D. was originally supposed to leave, I, without any clue as to the significance of the day, went with my wife to mail J.D. a package. As we were leaving the parking lot of the post office, she said, with a quiver in her voice, "I was supposed to see my son today." I could hear in her voice the ache in her heart. After a moment she then said, "I think Heavenly Father will let me see my son today." So off we went to the MTC with me thinking, "Sure, honey, like that will happen. Three thousand missionaries up there coming and going all the time, and we are going to see J.D. I don't think so."<br><br>We circled the field that is in front of the temple and just across the street from the MTC. On the south end of that field is a parking lot. As we approached that parking lot, there stood J.D., just as though he had been waiting for us. We pulled over, and out she jumped. As my wife threw her arms around her boy, I saw the weight of her world lifted off her shoulders as she saw with her own eyes what had become of her son. That was all she needed, and if she had not been listening to the promptings of the Spirit, we would have missed him.<br><br>I was reminded of two things on that day: (1) never trifle with the faith of a mother; and (2) Heavenly Father is mindful of each of His children. He knows our weight-lifting capacity, and He is there to help us when life starts to get heavy.<br><br>In most cases Heavenly Father uses us to lighten someone else's load. In the case of my Cierra, an understanding father pitched in and helped. Sometimes heaven takes matters into its own hands, as was the case with my dear wife seeing her missionary son. In both cases the burden was lifted. But sometimes the burden is not lifted immediately or in a manner that we would like. Recall when Alma and his followers were held captive by the Lamanites. Amulon, one of the former wicked priests of King Noah, was their ruler. Amulon and Alma had been companions in wickedness as priests of King Noah, and now Amulon didn't like the repentant Alma or his followers. In Mosiah 24 we read that "he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put taskmasters over them" (Mosiah 24:9). In short, Amulon made it his goal to make life miserable for Alma and his followers. And it worked. In verse 10 we read, "And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God." Seeing this, Amulon outlawed prayer and decreed that anyone "found calling upon God should be put to death" (verse 11). So Alma and his people prayed in their hearts, and the Lord heard their cries, and He answered their prayers in an interesting sort of way. We read:<br><br><i>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</i>[Mosiah 24:14–15]<br><br>In the case of Alma and his followers, rather than remove the burden, the Lord gave them increased strength to bear their burdens. And why? That they would know of a surety that the Lord does visit His people in their afflictions. I know this is true. There is personal growth that comes from receiving the strength to bear a burden. Sometimes that strength comes straight from heaven, and sometimes that strength comes from others who are sent by heaven.<br><br>Let me share with you the moment in my life when my world was its heaviest. One of our children was born with serious medical problems. The doctors knew the instant she arrived that all was not well. You have all probably seen those red emergency buttons that are in hospital rooms and have wondered, "What would happen if I were to push that button?" In this instance that button was pushed, and controlled chaos erupted. Doctors and nurses came running from all over the hospital. We, the parents, were pushed to the side as they took our baby and immediately prepped her for surgery. It turned out that her insides were not hooked together properly, and if they didn't act quickly she would not survive. And even if they did act quickly, things didn't look hopeful. We were told prior to the surgery that many babies with her condition just didn't make it. She was just a little over six pounds, less than one hour old, and she was going under the knife.<br><br>In less than one hour I had gone from the highest high to the lowest low. One minute my wife and I were eagerly awaiting the arrival of our beautiful baby. The next minute we were being told that this one might not ever go home with us. The weight of our world became crushing--and earthly angels instantly rushed to our aid to help us lift the burden. Family members, ward members, friends, and strangers--people we did not know--literally did all they could to help us face this struggle. And, believe me, watching a tiny newborn fight for life is a very heavy burden to bear. She made it through the first surgery. That was followed by ups and downs and then another surgery, and then another.<br><br>My wife or I were always at the hospital in hopes that our baby would somehow know that however things turned out, she was loved and she was not alone. All the while our other children were cared for. Food appeared from out of nowhere, and dirty dishes would simply vanish. The clothes hampers were always empty and the clothes closets were always full. Children would disappear for sleep-overs and reappear, well-kept, days later. People fasted for our baby. Prayers were offered for our baby and for our family--and the blessings of heaven rained down on our home. As with Alma and his people, the Lord did strengthen us that we could bear our burdens with ease. In this case we were strengthened by the willingness of countless Saints to magnify their baptismal covenants and help bear our burdens, mourn with us, and comfort us. After three surgeries and 35 days in the newborn intensive care unit, our baby came home, and she was perfect. Now, six years later, I am her prince and she is my princess. It was only through heaven's help and through the help of those around me that I was able to carry the weight of my world. I don't think I could have done it on my own.<br><br>For each of us there are moments when the weight of our world becomes almost unbearable. Interestingly enough, we each probably have classmates, friends, or family members who are, right now, experiencing dark moments and who need our help. Is Heavenly Father trying to tap us on the shoulder to point out those in need? Are we paying attention, or are we caught up in the thick of thin things?<br><br>Six years ago this month, from this very pulpit, President Hinckley gave a devotional talk about what the Church expects of each of us. President Hinckley reminded the students of BYU, as Paul of old had reminded the Hebrews, "Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (JST, Hebrews 12:12). The prophet then went on to provide this counsel:<br><br><i>I know that you are engrossed with your studies. This is important, but in a sense it is a selfish pursuit. Take a little time, now and again, to reach out to help others--there are those right around you, students in need of a little kindness, a little attention, a little appreciation. . . .</i><br><br><i>Give expression to the noble desires that lie within your hearts to reach out to comfort, sustain, and build others. As you do so, the cankering poison of selfishness will leave you, and it will be replaced by a sweet and wonderful feeling that seems to come in no other way. Never forget that the Church expects you to be benevolent and to do good to all men.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "To a Man Who Has Done What This Church Expects of Each of Us,"<i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1996), 54]<br><br>So what can we do? Let me suggest three things. First, lend a listening ear. Often after a hard day at the office, when it has felt like nothing can go right, I will go home and my wife will sense that it was a particularly tough day. She will sit me down, hold me close, and ask about my day. I will begin with something like, "All the other kids at school picked on me today." She will then listen as I tell her what went wrong and why it wasn't fair. At the appropriate times she will say something like, "I understand how you feel" or "That would have upset me, too." For a moment she lets me rest my load on her shoulders long enough for me to gather my strength, take a deep breath, and wade back into life.<br><br>When we are hiking in the mountains with a fully loaded pack, we look for those shady spots where we can rest for a moment, remove the weight from our backs, take a drink, and gather our strength for the rest of the journey. Listening is a shady spot on the trail of life. I don't need you to take my burdens. After all, how I handle my burdens is going to help develop celestial qualities within me. What I need is for you to, on occasion, hold them for me for just a moment while I rest and gather my strength.<br><br>Second, look for small things. Too often we look for huge things to do to lighten someone's load. Then, not finding big things to do, we often do nothing, thinking that the little things won't make a difference. But for me it is often the multitude of little things that gets me down. If someone would help me with those little things, I could then harness my energies for the big challenges.<br><br>When Cierra was in the hospital going through her struggles, it was the little things of life that were annoyingly distracting. Here is a simple little example. Every time I would come home from the hospital or from work, I would notice the newspapers scattered about on the front porch. At the time I didn't care much about the news of the world. I didn't have any desire to read the paper--or even to pick it up. So they started to accumulate. Those scattered newspapers would bother me every time I drove into the garage. I always meant to pick them up and throw them away, but that small task never even came close to making it onto my to-do list. Then one day I noticed they were gone. I was so stunned that I walked over to the front door. All the papers had been gathered in a neat little pile placed by the door. Every couple of days the newspapers would be gathered and placed in a neat pile by the front door. Who did it? I have no idea. Did that small thing make a difference to me? Absolutely!<br><br>Look for small things. To you they may not seem a big deal. But to the recipient your small deed may make a difference.<br><br>Here is my final suggestion: Err on the side of action. Have you ever found yourself face-to-face with an opportunity to help someone and said something like, "Surely someone else will help" or "I don't have the time right now" or "I have my own problems to worry about"? When it comes to helping others, when in doubt, get in the game. If there is help that needs to be given, give it. If you can make a difference for good, make it. Don't wait for an engraved invitation. Don't worry about what others might think. If the Spirit whispers to you that something needs to be done, do it.<br><br>So now you have my three suggestions: (1) lend a listening ear; (2) look for small things; and (3) err on the side of action. If implemented, they will allow us to lighten the loads of those whose worlds are too heavy.<br><br>Recall the prophet's pleas in Liberty Jail when his burden seemed at its heaviest. The Lord was mindful of Joseph's plight, as we read in verses 7 and 8 of section 121:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.</i><br><br>In one of Joseph's darkest moments, the Lord reached down and blessed him with the strength to go on. May we be an instrument in God's hands to make the burdens of others last for "but a small moment." Let us lift up the hands of those whose hang down, that they may "endure it well." There are people in our midst whose backs are bent from the weight of their world. It is our duty to seek them out and do what we can to lighten their load. I leave this challenge with each of us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>James D.

<h1>the Atonement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be here today to share a few thoughts with you. I appreciate the music that was so inspiring and the prayer to invoke the Lord's Spirit here today.<br><br>Three weeks ago today, President Bateman centered his devotional talk around a scripture counseling us to "search diligently in the light of Christ" and to "lay hold upon every good thing" (Moroni 7:19).<br><br>Now what constitutes searching diligently? Numerous studies have shown that the more you participate--actively participate--the more you learn. For example, I love to take my students on field trips because they become so thoroughly involved that they focus and learn. I have taken two groups of students to the most active volcano on earth to sample lava flows that are about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The students are in danger of receiving first-degree burns on their arms reaching down to get a lava sample with the pick end of their hammers. They smell the noxious sulfurous gases in the blue smoke coming out of the lava. They see the lava explode as it enters the ocean, and they see blocks of lava floating on the water as they boil the ocean. The soles of their boots may become very soft and begin to smoke if they walk too long on an active flow. Will they ever forget the essential characteristics of an active lava flow that they have learned through using all five senses? Never! Any type of learning that requires your full, undivided attention and a complete, strenuous effort is going to be very effective.<br><br>Does the Lord ever require such strenuous effort for our learning, profit, and blessing? Isaiah recorded that "Hezekiah wept sore" (Isaiah 38:3). Jacob "wrestled" (Genesis 32:24). Melchizedek "offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save" (Hebrews 5:7; see also JST note). Enos wrestled and "cried unto [God] in mighty prayer" (Enos 1:2, 4). Now these are active learners! There is nothing more active and draining than wrestling or crying! But does all learning need to be so painful?<br><br>There is one movie that my children have watched enough to memorize every line--and probably a good portion of the student body here today has done the same. The movie is<i>The Princess Bride.</i>According to<i>The Princess Bride,</i>what is the greatest thing in the world next to a good MLT (mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich)? The obvious answer is true love. Love is the most enjoyable and desirable form of active learning ever devised by God or man. I would like to emphasize how much more effectively we can learn by feeling something in our hearts than by just being able to write an equation for it. Love is the highest form of active learning, and it is far superior to wrestling, crying, or having your boots catch fire while walking on lava.<br><br>If we were to identify one single item that would be of greatest value to search and find, what would that be? I suspect that many here today might say it would be to know more about the Savior. If we are enrolled in this pursuit, it is certainly not a one-hour course! How extensive are the readings for this class? The Apostle John told us:<br><br><i>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.</i>[John 21:25]<br><br>If such a biography were written, it would be an incomparable biography! By contrast, you just heard my biography--only a paragraph or two given as my introduction, and that is it. I think that even my mother would be hard-pressed to write a more glowing or complete biography than that one! But with our Savior, a world full of books is inadequate to describe His accomplishments.<br><br>How can we possibly comprehend such a biography and such a being? If the surface of the earth were covered with Harold B. Lee libraries, each containing four-and-a-half million volumes like ours, the thousand trillion--or quadrillion--biographical volumes that could be housed would be insufficient. What would be written in all of those biographical volumes? Well, "worlds without number" has He created (Moses 1:33; see also John 1:3). Therefore, the creation of worlds may be a significant portion of this library but not the most important part. Perhaps the greatest work among His endless works is the infinite Atonement. After all, what is His work and His glory? See Moses 1:39. Whom does He agonize over? See Luke 22:44 and 3 Nephi 17:14. For whom has He suffered? See D&amp;amp;C 19:16. Yes, as Elder Maxwell notes, He is "in the details of our own lives" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Becoming a Disciple,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1996, 17). He has experienced all our "aching griefs" and, most important, paid a price we cannot fathom for our personal sins (Neal A. Maxwell, "Plow in Hope,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 60). Each of us has a unique place in His biography.<br><br>Is this biography simply hypothetical? Perhaps not, because we are told that "all things are written by the Father" (3 Nephi 27:26).<br><br>Now this infinite biography is not just a tragedy. The Lord is equally well acquainted with our accomplishments, because, as John also recorded, He is "the vine," and we "are the branches" (John 15:5). All the good nourishing influences that come into our lives come through Him. Without Him, we could do nothing. "For in him we live, and move, and have our being; . . . For we are also his offspring" (Acts 17:28). So, you see, the most complete biographies of each of our lives--both the growth and the pruning back--are really contained in His biography. And thanks be to God that this is the case!<br><br>The question remains: How can we possibly know all that is written in those quadrillion-plus volumes? Even if we search the scriptures diligently--for "they are they which testify of" him (John 5:39)--our knowledge may still be trivial when compared to His endless works (see Moses 1:33; John 1:3). But as we search diligently, the Lord can help to close that gap in vital areas. Here is the key: Our minds can't comprehend some things,<i>but our hearts can!</i>There is so much that the Lord can reveal to our hearts. It is that knowledge that is revealed to our hearts as well as to our minds that is vital. And it is by the power of His Spirit that He wants to write it in every heart (see Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10).<br><br>For example, as He revealed to Nephi with the vision of the tree of life, we can<i>know</i>and<i>feel</i>the love that He has for His children (see 1 Nephi 11:17–23). If we just know it but don't feel it, we are missing the boat. This is the fruit that is most desirable above all other fruits, and it is shed into the hearts of His children (see Romans 5:5). Then, if it grows in our hearts, we become Saints or, in other words, His sons and daughters.<br><br>For example, there are some biographies of Saints that we cannot hear recounted without<i>feeling</i>the love of the Savior--His love for them as well as for us. Let me tell you such a story, just a page from our Lord's biography--a page that spans a few generations and affects every one of us here today.<br><br>The story begins with Joseph Knight, who befriended Joseph Smith early in the history of the Restoration. He supplied Joseph Smith with many of the necessities of life while he was translating the Book of Mormon. In fact, he loaned his horse and wagon to Joseph Smith to recover the plates from the Hill Cumorah and then supplied some of the paper on which the translation was made. He often visited Joseph to make sure that he had adequate food to continue the work of translation. He was always giving and expecting nothing in return. (See Dean Jessee, "Joseph Knight's Recollection of Early Mormon History,"<i>BYU Studies</i>17, no. 1 [Autumn 1976]: 29–39.)<br><br>Newell Knight, Joseph's son, was equally faithful. Newel was the recipient of the first miracle in the Church and labored as a missionary with Orson Pratt and Hyrum Smith. In 1835, while working on the Kirtland Temple, Newell met and married Lydia Goldthwaite. Lydia had been baptized two years earlier after hearing the Prophet speak in Mount Pleasant, Canada. (See Jesse William Knight,<i>The Jesse Knight Family: Jesse Knight, His Forebears and Family</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1940], 9–15.)<br><br>After her baptism in Canada, Lydia had been extremely anxious to gather with the Saints in Kirtland. Her parents, although not members, finally gave Lydia "ample means" to move to Kirtland and to "be comfortable and respectable" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>14). As soon as Lydia arrived in Kirtland, she was approached by Vincent Knight, who exclaimed:<br><br><i>"Sister, the Prophet is in bondage and has been brought into distress by the persecutions of the wicked, and if you have any means to give, it will be a benefit to him." "Oh yes, sir," she replied, "here is all I have. I only wish it were more," emptying her purse containing perhaps fifty dollars, in his hand as she spoke.</i>[In<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>14]<br><br>The amount was just enough to free the Prophet Joseph Smith. Lydia apparently didn't worry that she was then left with nothing on her first day in Kirtland.<br><br>After several months Lydia met Newell, and they were married. They moved with many of the Saints to Missouri and then back to Nauvoo. As the Saints left Nauvoo, Newell was appointed by Brigham Young to lead the first company of 50. The following year, as the Saints were settled in log cabins on the prairie, Lydia recorded:<br><br><i>"On Monday morning, January 4th, 1847, Newel, whose health had been failing, said, 'Lydia, I believe I shall go to rest this winter.' The next night he awoke with a severe pain in his right side; a fever had set in, and in spite of all that loving hands could do, he grew worse. "I felt at last that I could not endure his sufferings any longer and that I ought not to hold him here. I knelt by his bedside and with my hands upon his pale forehead, asked my Heavenly Father to forgive my sins; and that the suffering of my companion might cease, and if he was appointed unto death, and could not remain with us that he might be quickly eased from pain and fall asleep in peace." Almost immediately, all pain left him and in a short time he sweetly fell asleep in death without a struggle or a groan.</i>[In<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>17–18]<br><br>Lydia was now left alone to care for seven children, and an eighth would be born a few months later. Her grandson J. William recorded that Lydia's "heart cried out in sorrow many times, for her burden seemed more than she could bear" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>21). Lydia could not then go west with the first company of Saints. Later that year President Brigham Young asked Lydia to give her three yoke of oxen and two wagons to another family who wanted to go west and "who could go and take care of themselves when they got there" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>21). So she gave up her wagons and oxen and stayed at Winter Quarters or nearby settlements until the summer of 1850. She then rented a yoke of oxen for $60 to move her family west and spent the next two years in the Salt Lake Valley working to repay the $60 debt. (See<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>21–23.)<br><br>Lydia always remained faithful, but one of her sons, Jesse, not only grew up inactive in the Church but would argue against the Church with his mother. J. William Knight recorded that on his grandmother's last visit to the Knight home before her death, his father Jesse said:<br><br><i>"Mother, how is it you are not preaching to me as you usually do?" She answered, "Jesse, I have prayed in the Temple for my children many times and on one occasion the Lord made known to me that I was not to worry about you any more, that you would one day understand for yourself." Father then said to her, "Mother, I know you must be mistaken, for I'm further from the Church now than I have ever been before." She replied, "I don't care what you say, I know you will one day see the Gospel for yourself, and I never intend to argue again with you about religion."</i>[<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>33]<br><br>Jesse's mother then returned to St. George and her temple work. On the day that she completed the temple work for the last family name that she had, she went to bed and quietly passed away to go meet Newel and "that God who gave [her] life" (see<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>24; Alma 40:11).<br><br>A few years later Jesse's family was afflicted with sickness. His youngest child, about two years old, was the first to become sick. J. William stated that Jennie "was the idol of the whole family" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>34). When the doctors declared that nothing more could be done to save her, Jesse's wife insisted that they call the elders to administer to the child. However, Jesse stated: "No, it would be hypocritical, now that the doctors have given her up, for me to resort to such a thing." "And besides," he said, "I have no faith in the Church" (in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>34).<br><br>Jesse's wife prevailed, and the elders were called. They administered to the unconscious two-year-old. As soon as they finished, Jennie immediately regained consciousness, sat up, and noticed the flowers in the window. Jesse's son J. William wrote, "From that very moment, my father's life was changed" and he "remembered the words of his mother" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>34). Jesse himself noted:<br><br><i>Soon after the miraculous healing of Jennie, our oldest girl, Minnie, was striken. . . . From the time she was taken ill, Minnie felt that she would not recover. When asked why she felt so, she answered that when Jennie was so bad she had asked God to take her if she would do as well as Jennie; so she counted the days, believing she would live but thirty days from the time she took sick.</i><br><br><i>Every day she kept the count, and departed as she had said. Her going was peaceful, her breath leaving her as she said the prayer, "Oh God, bless our household." I remembered now that when she was a baby she had diphtheria, and that then, almost seventeen years ago, I had promised the Lord that if he would spare her life I would not forget Him. I had not kept that promise. How keenly I felt the justice of her being taken from us! I suffered in my feelings. I prayed for forgiveness and help. My prayer was answered and I received a testimony.</i>[<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>35–36; original spelling]<br><br>In the late 1800s, the Tintic mining district near the southern end of Utah County was one of the more important mining districts in the western United States. Jesse had no real training in how to find an ore deposit, but he enjoyed prospecting anyway and did prospect for seven years in this district before he found anything of real worth. It is that discovery that was most remarkable and unexpected--at least by some.<br><br>This is the week in my Geology 460 course that we generally discuss how ore deposits such as those in the Tintic Mountains are formed and what the best indicators are for evaluating the possible proximity of a large ore deposit. These guides to finding an ore deposit are particularly well known for the East Tintic mining district because in the mid-1900s the United States Geological Survey spent 25 years working in the district to develop the exploration guides. To teach this part of the course, I take my students on a field trip to the area and show them the different types and combinations of hydrothermal alteration that are often indicative of a concealed ore deposit. Then I take them to the east side of Godiva Mountain, where the rocks are really quite unremarkable. I wish I could take all of you to this locality.<br><br>Well, let us imagine that we are on the east side of Godiva Mountain in southern Utah County. Our story resumes with Jesse sitting down somewhere around here to rest under a pine tree. Suddenly, to his surprise, "he heard a voice distinctly say to him, 'This country is here for the Mormons'" (in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>37). That was all. He assumed that was a good indication regarding the area where he was prospecting, so he continued looking. Jesse brought Jared Roundy, who he considered to be an expert miner, to come and evaluate the likelihood of there being ore concealed at depth on the site. He asked Mr. Roundy if he would like to be a partner in staking a claim on this site. Mr. Roundy declared that this area was a "darned" old humbug and that he wanted no part of it. Jesse was not deterred and staked his claim on this piece of ground that day, calling it the Humbug claim. (See Knight,<i>The Jesse Knight Family,</i>37–38.)<br><br>Jesse eventually began driving a tunnel to look for ore. There are piles of waste rock from the Humbug tunnels, and initially that is all there was--just waste rock. There was no ore to justify all of his effort. In fact, there were no other productive mines on this side of the mountain. But he was confident that ore would be found, so he hired the two very best miners that were working in the adjacent Tintic district and talked his son J. William into coming to work for him as well. Those three worked in eight-hour shifts, and Jesse's job was to wheel the broken rock out of the tunnel in a wheelbarrow. Driving a tunnel using just a single jackhammer and a wheelbarrow is extremely slow and difficult work. The four of them did this for almost two months, finding nothing except extremely boring and unremarkable limestone. (See<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>40.)<br><br>I agree with Jared Roundy: looking at this rock from a geologic point of view, there is no reason to anticipate finding anything of worth in the vicinity. Jesse must have had a lot of faith to continue this pursuit day after day! J. William Knight recorded:<br><br><i>One day while we were walking up the steep mountain side to do work in the Humbug claim, father said, "Will, I want to tell you something. We are going to have all the money that we want as soon as we are in a position to handle it properly. We will some day save the credit of the Church."</i>[<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>39]<br><br>Well, you know how children are with their parents. J. William was in disbelief. He reminded his father that they had mortgaged the ranch and that the Church, at this difficult juncture in 1896, "was in debt probably over a million dollars." Will thought his father's statement was "ridiculous," and he said that he "argued considerably" with him (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>39).<br><br>Here is where Jesse now sounded just like his mother. He replied, "I don't want to quarrel with you about it, but I never had anything come to me with greater force than the impression that came to me at this time, and all I want you to do is to remember what I am saying" (p. 39). Jesse regarded their future wealth as a sure thing and felt that it would be given strictly "for the purpose of doing good and building up the Church" (<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>39–40). So Jesse and his son didn't argue or discuss the matter any further.<br><br>About three o'clock one morning in August 1896, one of the two hired miners came down from the tunnel and said that he had just struck a vein containing ore. J. William was excited, but his father Jesse was rather subdued about it. They both went up to the tunnel, and Jesse went in and loaded up the first wheelbarrow full of ore and came out and dumped it on a small platform. Then he stated, "I have done the last day's work that I ever expect to do where I take another man's job from him" (in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>40). From then on he hoped he would be able to provide work and employment opportunities for others.<br><br>Before we finish our field trip here today, let me tell you about the ore. It may have been mostly lead sulfide or lead carbonate, but the real value of the ore was in gold and silver. Each ton of ore contained roughly 175 ounces of silver and 3.8 ounces of gold, which is very rich ore (see<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>41). So just a small pile of rock would contain the equivalent of 175 of these one-ounce silver coins. This is impressive, considering that this was supposedly a humbug of a claim!<br><br>It seems that the Lord was intent on testing Jesse's willingness to use this initial wealth strictly "for the purpose of doing good and building up the Church." This is how it unfolded. By the time October conference had arrived, Jesse had only made one shipment of ore. It was very rich ore and may have been worth about $11,000--similar to the second shipment that he sent in late October. At this time Jesse was living in Provo. At the end of general conference, his bishop and all other bishops and stake presidencies were invited to a special priesthood meeting. Near the end of the meeting, President Woodruff made a special plea to the bishops to visit with anyone in their wards who might loan the Church money for a short period of time. He explained to them that the Church was in very difficult financial circumstances because the federal government had confiscated a great deal of Church property. He said that "there were some very pressing demands" on the Church and that "the credit of the Church was at stake" (as reported by Joseph B. Keeler, in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>84).<br><br>Jesse's bishop thought nothing more about it until he was returning home from the Provo Tabernacle several weeks later. When he was a short distance from home, he clearly heard an audible voice say, "Jesse Knight will lend the Church $10,000.00" (Joseph B. Keeler, quoted in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>84). That was all the voice said, but he then clearly remembered what President Woodruff had asked of the bishops. He immediately went to Jesse Knight's house and began to relate what President Woodruff had told them about the Church's financial difficulties. Jesse Knight interrupted Bishop Keeler and said that he would loan the Church $10,000 and that he would have the check ready by the following morning. (See<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>84.)<br><br>Now how much money did Jesse have on hand at this time? He had probably received just one or two payments of around $11,000. Jesse had no way of knowing whether his newly found supply of ore might end as suddenly as it had appeared. But he was willing to do what his mother had done before him when she emptied her purse to free the Prophet Joseph Smith or when she gave her three yoke of oxen and two wagons to another family at the request of Brigham Young. Jesse followed through and wrote the check with no hesitation. Bishop Joseph Keeler noted that when President Woodruff received the sealed envelope from Jesse on the following day, "It appeared to me that a great weight was lifted off his mind." President Woodruff then wrote Jesse Knight a letter stating that he had saved the credit of the Church. His letter concluded with the following benediction: "I feel very thankful to you, and feel with every sentiment of my heart to say, God bless you and prosper you" (in<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>85).<br><br>Jesse was blessed, and he prospered from that day on. This was the first of a number of discoveries that he made on the east side of the mountain. The ore turned out to be nearly continuous underground for a distance of about two miles. Jesse's mines eventually netted more than $10 million. (See<i>Jesse Knight Family,</i>42–43.)<br><br>Here we are now, 105 years after that October conference when the Church was in such dire need and Jesse Knight was the willing conduit through which the Lord poured out a needed blessing. The Church has prospered and the Saints have prospered. I am sure that most of you know that much of our campus is constructed on land donated by Jesse Knight and his family. Four of the first eight buildings were built largely from their donations as well.<br><br>So why did this all happen? Why did the Lord choose Jesse Knight to save the credit of the Church and financially save this university? Was it Jesse's own sincere repentance and change of heart and his remarkable unselfishness? Was it his mother's frequent prayers in the temple? Was it his oldest daughter's unselfish sacrifice and parting benediction when she said, "Oh God, bless our household?" Was it his mother's unselfishness when she emptied her purse on the table in Kirtland to free the Prophet? Or when she gave her three yoke of oxen and two wagons to another family to go west while she stayed in Winter Quarters another three years? Would the Lord look back upon his grandfather's support of the Prophet during the translation of the Book of Mormon and then bless Jesse in return? Or was it all of these multiplied together? Do blessings carry forward that far? Moses had the answer:<br><br><i>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.</i>[Deuteronomy 7:9]<br><br>As impressive as the material blessings are that we sometimes focus on in this story, they are<i>not</i>the critical part of the story. Do you think that Lydia ever once prayed in the temple that her wayward son Jesse would become fabulously wealthy? Of course not! The<i>real story</i>is that a mother's relentless prayers were answered, her son repented, and the angels rejoiced (see D&amp;amp;C 88:2)!<br><br>Did Lydia need to wait patiently on the Lord? Absolutely! Jesse did not repent in his mother's lifetime, but, along with other Saints, she received this promise: that her prayers had entered the ears of the Lord, and He confirmed to her that they would be granted (see D&amp;amp;C 98:2). To Lydia and to us the Lord makes this promise concerning our heartfelt prayers:<br><br><i>He giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:3]<br><br>How much of this story is written in the biography of the Lord? When Lydia prayed by the bedside of her husband for forgiveness for her sins and pleaded that her companion's sufferings might cease, did the Lord know the depth of her anguish at that moment? When she went on without her husband but with seven small children to Winter Quarters, could He really understand it? When "her heart cried out in sorrow many times, for her burden seemed more than she could bear," did He fathom it? "Surely he hath borne [her] griefs, and carried [her] sorrows" (Isaiah 53:4).<br><br>Can you see that there would be all these details and multitudes more about each of our lives written in His biography because He has borne them? Consequently, as we reflect upon the lives of Saints, we can begin to<i>feel</i>the awesome power of the Atonement. That is the point I want to make! Can you mentally fathom a biography that is more than a thousand trillion volumes in length? No! By<i>feeling</i>we come to understand the Atonement better than by just having a mastery of all the facts. Perhaps this is why the fruit of the tree of life is shed into our hearts (see 1 Nephi 11:22). In our<i>hearts</i>we can feel and understand His love.<br><br>Is there an upper or lower limit to what our hearts can comprehend and feel? Moses recorded that Enoch's "heart swelled wide as eternity . . . and all eternity shook" (Moses 7:41). On a less grand scale, when we even detect these subtle "swelling motions," we know that they are "real" and "most precious" and "sweet above all that is sweet" (Alma 32:28, 35, 42).<br><br>Once we really come to know all that the Lord has done for us and for all our brothers and sisters, we will have a powerful motivating force to keep God's commandments. Sinning is unthinkable during those moments of seeing "things as they really are" (Jacob 4:13).<br><br>Finally, don't you wish you could read ahead a little in our Savior's biography to see how your individual chapter will proceed? As the Lord stands at the door and knocks (see Revelation 3:20), will you someday open that door and be "clasped in the arms of Jesus" (Mormon 5:11)?<br><br>Once when I was writing in my journal, my daughter Bonnie asked me if I had mentioned her that day in any of my writing. She wanted some reassurance of my love and interest in her. Was she important enough to be mentioned? I had forgotten her that day, and my heart melted. The Lord reassures Bonnie and each of us: "Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:15–16). So how often would we be mentioned in the Lord's biography? More often than we realize, for the Lord "ever liveth" to intercede on our behalf (Hebrews 7:25; see also Romans 8:34–35, 38–39). We hope our chapter in His biography will have no end.<br><br>My challenge to you today is to search diligently and actively participate to know and feel the love of Christ. If we are constantly seeking to know the breadth and depth of His atoning love and how very personal it really is, our seeking will not be in vain. Along with Abraham, one day we will be able to say, "Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; now I have found thee" (Abraham 2:12). I pray that it may be so with each of us, in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey D.

<h1> the Strength of the Lord:&quot; Grace and the Atonement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is for me a blessing and a remarkable responsibility to stand before you today. I appreciate the invitation from Elder Bateman to speak with you.<br><br>As I entered the Marriott Center this morning, my mind was flooded with wonderful memories. I have been in this arena many, many times. I was a freshman at BYU in 1970 when the construction work on this building was started. I vividly remember sitting way up there on September 11, 1973, and listening to the teachings and testimony of President Harold B. Lee. I had returned from my mission to southern Germany just three weeks earlier, and the message he presented that day was entitled "Be Loyal to the Royal Within You." I hope I shall never forget what I felt and heard and learned that day. His teachings have positively influenced me for the last 28 years.<br><br>I remember sitting right over there in 1973 when President Spencer W. Kimball, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, delivered a powerful and extremely direct message about the importance of eternal marriage ("Marriage Is Honorable," 30 September 1973). I also remember how squirmy I and the young woman with whom I attended that fireside were--on our first date. (For those of you who may be wondering, the young woman with whom I attended that fireside then is not Sister Bednar now.) And I remember sitting right over there in 1977 as a married student walking and wrestling with a young son. I sat right up there in 2000 when that same son graduated from BYU with his baccalaureate degree. I recall with great fondness numerous other occasions in this building when I have listened to inspired leaders and learned from great teachers.<br><br>It frankly never occurred to me that someday I might be invited to stand at this pulpit and speak to a group like you. It is clear to me that I likely will never be asked to do so again. Thus I have been most prayerful and serious about preparing my presentation for today. Assuming that I would never again stand at this pulpit to teach and testify, I have considered what might be the most important message I could share with you. My objective this morning is to describe and discuss both the<i>redeeming</i>and<i>enabling</i>powers of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. And I hope to place particular emphasis upon the enabling power of the Atonement. I yearn and invite and pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost to be with me and with you as we visit together for these few minutes about this sacred subject.<br><h2><b>The Journey of Life</b></h2><br>The framework for my message today is a statement by President David O. McKay. He summarized the overarching purpose of the gospel of the Savior in these terms: "The purpose of the gospel is ... to make bad men good and good men better, and to change human nature" (from the film<i>Every Member a Missionary,</i>as acknowledged by Franklin D. Richards,<i>CR,</i>October 1965, 136–37; see also Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>8:130 [22 July 1860]).<br><br>Thus the journey of a lifetime is to progress from bad to good to better and to experience the mighty change of heart--and to have our fallen natures changed.<br><br>May I suggest that the Book of Mormon is our handbook of instructions as we travel the pathway from bad to good to better and to have our hearts changed. If you have your scriptures with you this morning, please turn with me to Mosiah 3:19. In this verse King Benjamin teaches about the journey of mortality and about the role of the Atonement in successfully navigating that journey: "For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit,<i>and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint</i>through the atonement of Christ the Lord" (emphasis added).<br><br>I want to stop at this point and draw our attention to two specific phrases. First, consider "and putteth off the natural man." Let me suggest to you that President McKay was fundamentally talking about putting off the natural man when he said, "The purpose of the gospel is ... to make bad men good." Now I do not believe the word<i>bad</i>in this statement by President McKay connotes only<i>wicked, awful, horrible,</i>or<i>inherently evil.</i>Rather, I think he was suggesting that the journey from bad to good is the process of putting off the natural man or the natural woman in each of us. In mortality we all are tempted by the flesh. The very elements out of which our bodies were created are by nature fallen and ever subject to the pull of sin, corruption, and death. And we can increase our capacity to overcome the desires of the flesh and temptations, as described in this verse, "through the atonement of Christ." When we make mistakes--as we transgress and sin--we are able to overcome such weakness through the redeeming and cleansing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. As we frequently sing in preparation to partake of the emblems of the sacrament, "His precious blood he freely spilt; His life he freely gave, A sinless sacrifice for guilt, A dying world to save" ("How Great the Wisdom and the Love,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 195).<br><br>Now, please notice the next line in Mosiah 3:19: "and becometh a saint." May I suggest this phrase describes the continuation and second phase of life's journey as outlined by President McKay. "The purpose of the gospel is ... to make bad men good"--or, in other words, put off the natural man--"and good men better"--or, in other words, become more like a saint. Brothers and sisters, I believe this second part of the journey--this process of going from good to better--is a topic about which we do not study or teach frequently enough nor understand adequately.<br><br>If I were to emphasize one overarching point this morning, it would be this: I suspect that you and I are much more familiar with the nature of the redeeming power of the Atonement than we are with the enabling power of the Atonement. It is one thing to know that Jesus Christ came to earth to<i>die</i>for us. That is fundamental and foundational to the doctrine of Christ. But we also need to appreciate that the Lord desires, through His Atonement and by the power of the Holy Ghost, to<i>live</i>in us--not only to direct us but also to empower us. I think most of us know that when we do things wrong, when we need help to overcome the effects of sin in our lives, the Savior has paid the price and made it possible for us to be made clean through His redeeming power. Most of us clearly understand that the Atonement is for sinners. I am not so sure, however, that we know and understand that the Atonement is also for saints--for good men and women who are obedient and worthy and conscientious and who are striving to become better and serve more faithfully. I frankly do not think many of us "get it" concerning this enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement, and I wonder if we mistakenly believe we must make the journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the gospel of the Savior is not simply about avoiding bad in our lives; it also is essentially about doing and becoming good. And the Atonement provides help for us to overcome and avoid bad and to do and become good. There is help from the Savior for the entire journey of life--from bad to good to better and to change our very nature.<br><br>I am not trying to suggest that the redeeming and enabling powers of the Atonement are separate and discrete. Rather, these two dimensions of the Atonement are connected and complementary; they both need to be operational during all phases of the journey of life. And it is eternally important for all of us to recognize that<i>both</i>of these essential elements of the journey of life--both putting off the natural man and becoming a saint, both overcoming bad and becoming good--are accomplished through the power of the Atonement. Individual willpower, personal determination and motivation, and effective planning and goal setting are necessary but ultimately insufficient to triumphantly complete this mortal journey. Truly we must come to rely upon "the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (2 Nephi 2:8).<br><h2><b>Grace and the Enabling Power of the Atonement</b></h2><br>I now want to describe in greater detail the enabling power of the Atonement. Brothers and sisters, please notice the use of the word<i>grace</i>in the verse from 2 Nephi to which we just referred. In the Bible Dictionary in our scriptures we learn that the word<i>grace</i>frequently is used in the scriptures to connote<i>enabling power.</i>On page 697, under the word<i>grace,</i>we read:<br><br>"A word that occurs frequently in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul. The main idea of the word is<i>divine means of help or strength,</i>given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ (emphasis added).<br><br>"It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of everlasting life."<br><br>Please note these next sentences:<br><br><i>"It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals,</i>through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins,<i>receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power</i>that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts" (emphasis added).<br><br>That is, grace represents that divine assistance or heavenly help each of us will desperately need to qualify for the celestial kingdom. Thus the enabling power of the Atonement strengthens us to do and be good and serve beyond our own individual desire and natural capacity.<br><br>In my personal scripture study I often insert the term<i>enabling power</i>whenever I encounter the word<i>grace.</i>Consider, for example, this verse with which we are all familiar: "For we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23).<br><br>Let's review this verse one more time: "For we know that it is by grace [the enabling and strengthening power of the Atonement of Christ] that we are saved, after all we can do."<br><br>I believe we can learn much about this vital aspect of the Atonement if we will insert<i>enabling and strengthening power</i>each time we find the word<i>grace</i>in the scriptures.<br><h2><b>Illustrations and Implications</b></h2><br>The journey of a lifetime, as described by President McKay, is to go from bad to good to better and to have our very natures changed. And the Book of Mormon is replete with examples of disciples and prophets who knew and understood and were transformed by the enabling power of the Atonement in making that journey. May I suggest, brothers and sisters, that as we come to better understand this sacred power, our gospel perspective will be greatly enlarged and enriched. Such a perspective will change us in remarkable ways.<br><br>Nephi is an example of one who knew and understood and relied upon the enabling power of the Savior. In 1 Nephi 7 we recall that the sons of Lehi had returned to Jerusalem to enlist Ishmael and his household in their cause. Laman and others in the party traveling with Nephi from Jerusalem back to the wilderness rebelled, and Nephi exhorted his brethren to have faith in the Lord. It was at this point in their trip that Nephi's brothers bound him with cords and planned his destruction. Now please note Nephi's prayer in verse 17: "O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even<i>give me strength that I may burst these bands</i>with which I am bound" (emphasis added).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, do you know what I likely would have prayed for if I had been tied up by my brothers? My prayer would have included a request for something bad to happen to my brothers and ended with the phrase "wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren" or, in other words, "Please get me out of this mess, now!" It is especially interesting to me that Nephi did not pray, as I probably would have prayed, to have his circumstances changed. Rather, he prayed for the strength to change his circumstances. And may I suggest that he prayed in this manner precisely because he knew and understood and had experienced the enabling power of the Atonement of the Savior.<br><br>I personally do not believe the bands with which Nephi was bound just magically fell from his hands and wrists. Rather, I suspect that he was blessed with both persistence and personal strength beyond his natural capacity, that he then "in the strength of the Lord" (Mosiah 9:17) worked and twisted and tugged on the cords and ultimately and literally was enabled to break the bands.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the implication of this episode for each of us is quite straightforward. As you and I come to understand and employ the enabling power of the Atonement in our personal lives, we will pray and seek for strength to change our circumstances rather than praying for our circumstances to be changed. We will become agents who "act" rather than objects that are "acted upon" (2 Nephi 2:14).<br><br>Consider the example in Mosiah 24 as Alma and his people are being persecuted by Amulon. As recorded in verse 14, the voice of the Lord came to these good people in their affliction and indicated: "And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs."<br><br>Now if I had been one of Alma's people and received that particular assurance, my response likely would have been, "I thank thee, and please hurry!" But notice in verse 15 the process the Lord used to lighten the burden: "And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea,<i>the Lord did strengthen them</i>that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord" (emphasis added).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, what was changed in this episode? It was not the burden that changed; the challenges and difficulties of persecution were not immediately removed from the people. But Alma and his followers were strengthened, and their increased capacity and strength made the burdens they bore lighter. These good people were empowered through the Atonement to<i>act</i>as agents and imp<i>act</i>their circumstances--"in the strength of the Lord." Alma and his people were then directed to safety in the land of Zarahemla.<br><br>Now some of you may legitimately be wondering, "Brother Bednar, what makes you think the episode with Alma and his people is an example of the enabling power of the Atonement?" I believe the answer to your question is found in a comparison of Mosiah 3:19 and Mosiah 24:15. Let's resume reading in Mosiah 3:19 where we previously had stopped: "and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and<i>becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord</i>seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father" (emphasis added).<br><br>As we progress in the journey of mortality from bad to good to better, as we put off the natural man or woman in each of us, and as we strive to become saints and have our very natures changed, then the attributes detailed in this verse increasingly should describe the type of person you and I are becoming. We will become more childlike, more submissive, more patient, and more willing to submit. Now compare these characteristics in Mosiah 3:19 with those used to describe Alma and his people in the latter part of verse 15 in Mosiah 24: "and they did<i>submit</i>cheerfully and<i>with patience</i>to<i>all the will of the Lord"</i>(emphasis added).<br><br>I find the parallels between the attributes described in these verses striking and an indication that Alma's good people were becoming a better people through the enabling power of the Atonement of Christ the Lord.<br><br>We are all familiar with the story of Alma and Amulek contained in Alma 14. In this episode many faithful Saints had been put to death by fire, and these two servants of the Lord had been imprisoned and beaten. Please consider this petition contained in verse 26 offered by Alma as he prayed in prison: "O Lord,<i>give us strength</i>according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance" (emphasis added).<br><br>Here again we see reflected in his request Alma's understanding of and confidence in the enabling power of the Atonement. Now note the result of this prayer, as described in the latter part of verse 26 and in verse 28:<br><br>"And they [Alma and Amulek] broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them....<br><br>"And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for<i>the Lord had granted unto them power,</i>according to their faith which was in Christ" (emphasis added).<br><br>Once again the enabling power is evident as good people struggle against evil and strive to become even better and serve more effectively "in the strength of the Lord" (Mosiah 9:17).<br><br>Let me present one final example from the Book of Mormon. In Alma 31, Alma is directing a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites. You will recall that in this chapter we learn about Rameumptom and the prescribed and prideful prayer offered by the Zoramites. Please notice the plea for strength in Alma's personal prayer, as described in verse 31: "O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me<i>that I may have strength,</i>that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people" (emphasis added).<br><br>In verse 33 Alma also prays that his missionary companions will receive a similar blessing: "Wilt thou grant unto them<i>that they may have strength,</i>that they may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people" (emphasis added).<br><br>Again we observe that Alma did not pray to have his afflictions removed. He knew he was an agent of the Lord, and he prayed for the power to act and affect his situation.<br><br>The key point of this example is contained in the final verse, Alma 31:38: "Yea, and<i>he also gave them strength,</i>that they should suffer no manner of afflictions,<i>save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.</i>Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith" (emphasis added).<br><br>No, the afflictions were not removed. But Alma and his companions were strengthened and blessed through the enabling power of the Atonement to "suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ." What a marvelous blessing. And what a lesson each of us should learn.<br><br>Examples of the enabling power are not found only in the scriptures. Daniel W. Jones was born in 1830 in Missouri, and he joined the Church in California in 1851. In 1856 he participated in the rescue of handcart companies that were stranded in Wyoming by severe storms. After the rescue party found the suffering Saints, provided what immediate comfort they could, and made arrangements for the sick and the feeble to be transported to Salt Lake City, Daniel and several other young men volunteered to remain with and safeguard the company's possessions. The food and supplies left with Daniel and his colleagues were, to say the least, meager and were rapidly expended. I will now quote from Daniel Jones' personal journal and his description of the events that followed:<br><br>"Game soon became so scarce that we could kill nothing. We ate all the poor meat; one would get hungry eating it. Finally that was all gone, nothing now but hides were left. We made a trial of them. A lot was cooked and eaten without any seasoning and it made the whole company sick. Many were so turned against the stuff that it made them sick to think of it....<br><br>"Things looked dark, for nothing remained but the poor raw hides taken from starved cattle. We asked the Lord to direct us what to do. The brethren did not murmur, but felt to trust in God. We had cooked the hide, after soaking and scraping the hair off until it was soft and then ate it, glue and all. This made it rather inclined to stay with us longer than we desired. Finally I was impressed how to fix the stuff and gave the company advice, telling them how to cook it; for them to scorch and scrape the hair off; this had a tendency to kill and purify the bad taste that scalding gave it. After scraping, boil one hour in plenty of water, throwing the water away which had extracted all the glue, then wash and scrape the hide thoroughly, washing in cold water, then boil to a jelly and let it get cold, and then eat with a little sugar sprinkled on it. This was considerable trouble, but we had little else to do and it was better than starving" (Daniel W. Jones,<i>Forty Years Among the Indians</i>[Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1890], 81).<br><br>All that I have read thus far is a preparation for the next line from Daniel W. Jones' journal. It illustrates how those pioneer Saints may have known something about the enabling power of the Atonement that we, in our prosperity and ease, are not as quick to understand: "We asked the Lord to bless our stomachs and<i>adapt them to this food"</i>(Jones,<i>Forty Years,</i>81; emphasis added). My dear brothers and sisters, I know what I would have prayed for in those circumstances. I would have prayed for something else to eat. "Heavenly Father, please send me a quail or a buffalo." It never would have occurred to me to pray that my stomach would be strengthened and adapted to what we already had. What did Daniel W. Jones know? He knew about the enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He did not pray that his circumstances would be changed. He prayed that he would be strengthened to deal with his circumstances. Just as Nephi, Amulek, and Alma and his people were strengthened, Daniel W. Jones had the spiritual insight to know what to ask for in that prayer. "We hadn't the faith to ask him to bless the raw-hide, for it was 'hard stock.' On eating now all seemed to relish the feast. We were three days without eating before this second attempt was made. We enjoyed this sumptuous fare for about six weeks" (Jones,<i>Forty Years,</i>81–82).<br><br>The enabling power of the Atonement of Christ strengthens us to do things we could never do on our own. Sometimes I wonder if in our latter-day world of ease--in our world of microwave ovens and cell phones and air-conditioned cars and comfortable homes--I wonder if we ever learn to acknowledge our daily dependence upon the enabling power of the Atonement.<br><br>The greatest lessons I have learned about the enabling power have come from the quiet example of my wife in our own home. I watched her persevere through intense and continuous morning sickness and vomiting during each of her three pregnancies. She literally was sick all day every day for eight months with each pregnancy. That challenge was never removed from her. But together we prayed that she would be strengthened, and she indeed was blessed through the enabling power of the Atonement to do physically what in her own power she could not do. Sister Bednar is a remarkably capable and competent woman, and over the years I have seen how she has been magnified to handle the mocking and scorn that come from a secular society when a Latter-day Saint woman heeds prophetic counsel and makes the family and home and the nurturing of children her highest priorities. In today's world a righteous woman and mother in Zion will need both priesthood support and the enabling power of the Atonement. I thank and pay tribute to Susan for helping me to learn such invaluable lessons.<br><br>In Alma 7 we learn how and why the Savior is able to provide the enabling power, beginning with verse 11: "And he shall go forth, suffering<i>pains</i>and<i>afflictions</i>and<i>temptations</i>of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the<i>pains</i>and the<i>sicknesses</i>of his people" (emphasis added).<br><br>Thus the Savior has suffered not just for our iniquities but also for the inequality, the unfairness, the pain, the anguish, and the emotional distress that so frequently beset us. Additional detail is described in verse 12:<br><br>"And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their<i>infirmities,</i>that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (emphasis added).<br><br>There is no physical pain, no anguish of soul, no suffering of spirit, no infirmity or weakness that you or I ever experience during our mortal journey that the Savior did not experience first. You and I in a moment of weakness may cry out, "No one understands. No one knows." No human being, perhaps, knows. But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands, for He felt and bore our burdens before we ever did. And because He paid the ultimate price and bore that burden, He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy in so many phases of our life. He can reach out, touch, and succor--literally run to us--and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do through relying only upon our own power.<br><br>Perhaps now we can more fully understand and appreciate the lesson of Matthew 11:28–30:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i><br><br>I express my appreciation for the infinite and eternal sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Atonement is not only for people who have done bad things and are trying to be good. It is for good people who are trying to become better and serve faithfully and who yearn for an ongoing and mighty change of heart. Indeed, "in the strength of the Lord" (Mosiah 9:17) we can do and overcome all things.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know the Savior lives. I have experienced both His redeeming and enabling power, and I witness that these powers are real and available to each of us. I know He directs the affairs of this Church. I know apostles and prophets authoritatively act for and in behalf of the Lord Jesus Christ. These things I know to be true and so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David A.

<h1>’s Plan for Peace - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My young brothers and sisters, I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you. I am thrilled and humbled to know that you are watching from around the world. We live in times of incredible technological advances. I stand here in Provo, Utah, and through modern communication satellites you can listen to and watch my every comment. I had better do a good job tonight and communicate effectively!<br><br>As I mention communication, I am reminded of a story about a hiker who ate a condor, a protected species of wild bird. It seems that the hiker was apprehended and taken before a judge, who sentenced him to life at hard labor. Before leaving the courtroom, however, the defendant asked the judge to listen to his side of the story because he felt there were extenuating circumstances. The hiker explained that he had been lost in the wilderness and had been hiking for three days and three nights without food or water and just by chance had spotted this condor sitting on a rock, had thrown a rock at it, killed it, and ate it, and then walked for three more days and three more nights before getting to civilization. The hiker said, "If I hadn't eaten that bird, I wouldn't be alive today." The judge responded by saying that those certainly were unusual circumstances, and in view of the fact that the hiker's life had been in danger, he, the judge, would suspend the sentence. The defendant thanked him and began to leave the courtroom, but as he did, the judge asked, "Oh, by the way, what did the condor taste like?" The hiker paused for a moment and then responded, "Well, it was kind of between a bald eagle and a spotted owl."<br><br>I might say I hope that this evening I am able to communicate better than the hiker did.<br><h2><b>Challenges to Our Personal Peace</b></h2><br>You see, I do have a very important and serious message that I want to communicate to you. I have learned that some young people are vulnerable when life's situations do not conform to their desires. Before I address how we can make ourselves less vulnerable, let's look together at some of the challenges faced by Latter-day Saint young people. I do this to illustrate that what you may consider challenging today may turn out to be a mere bump in the road compared with the mountains you may have to climb later in life.<br><br>One young person recently described her main challenge in life this way: "If I don't look perfect, there's not much chance to date and marry." Another said, "It's hard to avoid loneliness when things are always changing. My friends are getting married, moving away, and going on missions."<br><br>When it came to maintaining spirituality, one young person said: "I want to stay as spiritual as when I was a missionary but live a normal life, too. It's disheartening when I can't keep the same level of spirituality."<br><br>Another expressed this thought: "Dating is a challenge. I feel like my biggest weaknesses are moral temptations."<br><br>When considering what to do and who he is, one young person described it this way: "My biggest challenge is figuring out what I should do and how I should spend the rest of my life."<br><br>Finally, another added: "I'm trying to decide what to do for a career, where to study, and when to get married."<br><br>I'm sure many have perhaps faced questions and challenges similar to these at some time in their youth. What I would like you to understand is that there is a plan that can help you face these challenges and even greater ones. That plan will help you to have peace in your life.<br><br>As my wife, Sue, and I have traveled throughout the world on assignment for the Church, we have come to know and love the great global Latter-day Saint family that this Church has become. We have laughed and cried with the Saints as we have watched their lives and, on occasion, witnessed their acts of courage.<br><br>During our time in the Philippines we saw firsthand the adversity people were confronted with by the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. We felt the earthquakes; we saw the floods and typhoons; we watched as homes were destroyed and families uprooted. We even witnessed the death that came to many. Yet during these times of great difficulty, we also witnessed Latter-day Saint families who, in spite of their personal hardships, were at peace, optimistic for the future, and full of faith.<br><br>Recently I received a letter from Jeremy Chatelain. I first met Jeremy some years ago in the Philippines as he served a full-time mission for the Church. Following his honorable release, he married and about three years ago was appointed to a teaching post in the Church Educational System. Jeremy and his wife, Connie, looked forward to their new life together and his working full-time with seminary students in Idaho. Just before he started his new career, Jeremy, Connie, and their families went swimming at a favorite location. Everyone was enjoying a wonderful time swimming and having fun together. When Jeremy dived into the water for the last time that day, little did he realize it would change his life on earth forever.<br><br>He writes:<br><br><i>It's hard for me to believe that it has been a little more than three years since my accident. . . . We have been greatly blessed in our lives. I left the hospital in October of 1998 and returned to Ogden to acclimate to life as a quadriplegic outside of the hospital. . . . We have now been living in a home in Blackfoot, Idaho, for nearly three years. The Lord must surely see the future and can mercifully guide us accordingly. We found the house before the accident and curiously noted, among other things, that many of the doors were extra wide, thus wheelchair friendly. We have had to make very few changes to accommodate my needs, which has spared our finances for other necessities and wants.</i><br><br>He continues:<br><br><i>Another tremendous blessing in our lives is the Church Educational System. When many other employers would have counted my disabilities too great to continue employment, CES has maintained a very warm, caring, and accommodating relationship with us. . . . We have been included in all of the functions as if my accident had not happened. Our seminary building has been set up so that with near complete independence I can access my office and the classroom well enough to volunteer teach one period daily each trimester.</i><br><br>Despite the many challenges he faces as a quadriplegic, Jeremy writes about his future plans this way: "I am currently pursuing my master of education and hope to complete it within another year or so. My next goal is then to try to come back and teach full-time."<br><br>I am pleased to report that Jeremy, his wife, and students are watching this broadcast in Blackfoot, Idaho, tonight.<br><br>Speaking of Connie, his bride of just a few years, he says:<br><br><i>My wife has been unfailingly supportive in all I've done and has made great personal sacrifices to maintain our marriage. We even returned to the Philippines, wheelchair and all, last fall at the conclusion of my brother's mission in Baguio. It brought me great joy to introduce my wife to the Filipinos, for whom I have tremendous love.</i><br><br>He concluded his letter by telling me of yet another challenge they faced:<br><br><i>Nearly a year ago Connie was involved in a serious car accident on the Malad pass. Her car lost traction on a snowy overpass and rolled down into the median. It crushed the car and broke seven of her ribs, as well as a number of bones in her back. I nearly lost her that day. She spent about a week in the hospital and a few more months before the pain somewhat subsided. She is doing well now and is working as a medical assistant at a clinic here in town.</i><br><br>When many others would have wallowed in self-pity and doubt, Jeremy described his setbacks this way: "Life yet continues to provide us with learning experiences. We have been truly blessed."<br><br>I share part of that humbling letter with you to illustrate that regardless of the challenges, the Lord can bring peace into the lives of those who are distressed.<br><br>In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said:<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:2–4]<br><br>Later, to the pioneers embarking on the trek west, the Lord declared: "My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 136:31).<br><br>Further, President Spencer W. Kimball once taught:<br><br><i>Being human, we would expel from our lives physical pain and mental anguish and assure ourselves of continual ease and comfort, but if we were to close the doors upon sorrow and distress, we might be excluding our greatest friends and benefactors. Suffering can make saints of people as they learn patience, long-suffering, and self-mastery.</i>[<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972), 98]<br><br>You recall that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it" (<i>HC</i>5:134).<br><br>As we walk the path the Prophet speaks of, sometimes we are accompanied by trial, adversity, disappointments, heartache, and discouragement. As Latter-day Saints, we are taught that we came to earth to experience life in mortality. It is part of the plan for our eternal progress. As we deal with our challenges, temptations, pain, and sorrows, we learn to appreciate goodness, virtue, and happiness.<br><br>Problems, challenges, and heartaches come to all--young and old, male and female, married or single. Sometimes when that pain comes, it can be almost unbearable, and it is then that we find ourselves in need of help.<br><h2><b>Peace in Times of Trouble</b></h2><br>Recent events have illustrated once again the reason we need a source of comfort and hope in our lives.<br><br>Speaking at general conference a month ago, President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>Now we are at war. Great forces have been mobilized and will continue to be. Political alliances are being forged. We do not know how long this conflict will last. We do not know what it will cost in lives and treasure. We do not know the manner in which it will be carried out. It could impact the work of the Church in various ways.</i><br><br>He added:<br><br><i>We are people of peace. We are followers of the Christ who was and is the Prince of Peace. But there are times when we must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty.</i>["The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 72]<br><br>After John Clifford in Cork, Ireland, heard the terrible news of the terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, his first thoughts were of his brother, Ronnie, who worked in the World Trade Center. John frantically tried to discover news of his brother and whether or not he had survived the disaster. Just hours after finding out that his brother had indeed survived, John then learned that his sister, Ruth, and her four-year-old daughter, Juliana, had been on board one of the aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center towers. Another brother, Mark, said, "No words could describe what we feel about this" ("Corkman Tells of Brother's Escape,"<i>The Irish Times on the Web,</i>13 September 2001 http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/world/2001/0913/amer23.htm).<br><br>Regardless of whether it be an individual, family, or nation that is suffering, what message of comfort can we as Latter-day Saints offer those who mourn? How do we answer people who ask, "How will I ever get over this?"<br><br>Do we now or have we ever faced trials in our lives that can cause us to doubt the love our Heavenly Father has for His children? How do we deal with tragedy or adversity in our own lives? What is the solution to the ills that torment mankind?<br><br>The Savior Himself provided an answer to this question when He met with His Apostles on the night before His Crucifixion. He said: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).<br><br>Here the Lord notes a distinction between His peace and man's peace. Man's peace is usually identified as the absence of war. The Lord's peace cannot be disturbed even in the midst of war. You will remember the peace the Savior enjoyed. Even during His trial before Pilate, with the shouting multitude on one side and the doubting governor on the other, He was at peace. The Savior introduced this peace and showed us how to live with it.<br><br>Through our own personal experiences we can discover that the great source for peace in this world comes from one source, our Savior, even Jesus Christ. Of that I bear testimony. Never forget it. No matter how great the trial, no matter how much the suffering, the Master can always bring the needed peace. His gospel stands as a beacon of light in a world darkened by the influence of evil. Millions of people today are looking for answers. They thirst for peace, they want comfort in their lives, and they seek to know if they are safe. Those that mourn ask, "Will I see my loved one beyond the grave?"<br><br>In my own life there have been times when I have had to exercise great faith in my Heavenly Father and wait for peace and reassurance to come to me.<br><br>While serving in the Philippines in 1996, my wife and I received a phone call advising us that our daughter-in-law Tamara had been taken to the hospital in very serious condition. It was not known if she would survive. This happened just as we were preparing to come for general conference. Upon learning of her illness, we returned a few days early.<br><br>We learned that one evening Tamara felt like she was coming down with the flu. The next morning she didn't feel any better, so our son suggested she stay in bed and he would get the children off to school and would check back with her later.<br><br>Fortunately, later that morning our daughter, Nanette, went to Tamara and Ben's home to borrow their van. When she arrived she asked their five-year-old son if his mother was there. He said she was in bed but that she would not talk to him. Nanette called the paramedics, who came to the home and rushed her to the hospital.<br><br>The doctor said, "We don't know what she has, but if it is what we think it is, we need to treat it now or she won't be alive tomorrow." The diagnosis was correct. Tamara had a serious brain infection, a type of meningitis. The disease spread very quickly. She was put on a ventilator and our sons administered to her. She developed a fever, had gall bladder problems, and her lungs collapsed. She was given medication to keep the blood around the vital organs so they would not fail.<br><br>Consequently her fingers and her toes went black and amputation became a possibility. They were able to save her fingers, one half of one foot, and two-thirds of the other. The doctor said, "I have no idea why your wife is still alive. I am a scientist, and, by all the books, she should be dead. All I can say is that it wasn't her time."<br><br>Tamara was in a coma for six weeks, in special care for two weeks, and in a rehabilitation hospital for three weeks, after which she had to go through years of rehabilitation. Following conference, my wife remained in Salt Lake to help with our family.<br><br>While touring the Micronesia Guam Mission on the island of Majuro, I received a message that my wife needed to talk to me as soon as possible. My first thought was that something had happened to Tamara. When I called my wife, she reported that Tamara was holding her own but that our son, Brad, was in the hospital undergoing surgery.<br><br>Brad was in the process of taking down a large garage door at work. He had pushed down the old door with a forklift and knew he had to make sure that the old springs that operated the door were unwound. I now quote Brad:<br><br><i>Upon inspecting the springs, I could see that they were still fully loaded. I proceeded to the springs and hit them both with the sledgehammer, and the springs appeared to unwind. All appeared safe now to dismantle the door.</i><br><br><i>With gloved hands I reached down to pull the torsion bar assembly away from the rubble heap. The instant I pulled on the torsion bar I must have released some unseen pressure as the rod twisted around, grabbing my glove and pulling my hand and arm into the springs. The next thing I knew I was twisted around the torsion bar three times up to my elbow, with my glove partially pulled off my hand. There was a trickle of blood dripping from my glove.</i><br><br><i>I couldn't see what was damaged, as I was having a hard time keeping my balance as the pressure from the springs was twisting me off my feet in an attempt to wrap me further around the torsion bar. I was grateful my teenage son, Josh, was there. He got some additional help, and they were able to release enough pressure so I could start to untangle myself and get out of the grasp of the twisting torsion bar.</i><br><br><i>As I freed my blood-soaked glove, it fell to the ground, and I then noticed my hand was missing the thumb, which had been torn off. I told Josh to get some clean towels to wrap my hand in. As I attempted to retrieve my thumb from inside the glove, I got the bleeding stopped and held my thumb in the palm of my hand and asked Josh to drive me to the hospital.</i><br><br><i>Shortly after we arrived, I found myself in the operating room. Four surgeons and five hours later, they had reattached my thumb to my hand.</i><br><br><i>Following the surgery I received a blessing from my father-in-law and brother-in-law. The next day each of the doctors looked at my hand. They appeared surprised the surgery appeared to be so successful. By the end of the week they all put their doubts aside and said it looked like a keeper and told me I could finally go home. How appreciative I am for the blessing I received, for the words of healing and restoration in my behalf, and even more for a loving Father in Heaven, who knows what is best for me.</i><br><br>My mission tour continued. A few days later, while on the island of Palau, I received another phone call from my wife. Tamara was still holding her own, and Brad's hand was okay. What is it this time? She then advised me that she had been diagnosed by the doctor as having cancer on her nose and that it was deep enough they felt she should have a plastic surgeon perform the surgery, which would take place in the next couple of days.<br><br>Fortunately the surgery was successful, and today she is just as beautiful as ever.<br><br>As I now reflect on that time of family crisis, I recall the peace and hope that the gospel of Jesus Christ brought into my life and the quiet calm that came to me through the Holy Ghost. We had received promises in His holy house that our family could be eternal, and that knowledge brought me great peace and comfort. I did not know at that time how it was going to turn out, but I did know that whatever happened, my family and I were loved by our Savior.<br><br>Book of Mormon prophets remind us that the Savior is our hope for future justice and peace.<br><br>The great prophet Abinadi fearlessly testified that we "shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him" (Mosiah 16:10). We know from Mosiah that "the judgments of God are always just" (Mosiah 29:12). We also know that He "gave the law" (3 Nephi 15:5).<br><br>Nephi taught that the Lord is loving: "He loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life" (2 Nephi 26:24). Nephi's father, Lehi, taught that Christ is "the great Mediator of all men" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>We are also reminded that He is our Savior: "There is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ . . . , whereby man can be saved" (2 Nephi 25:20).<br><br>In 1839 the Prophet Joseph Smith and five colleagues were confined illegally in filthy conditions in Liberty Jail during four long, cold winter months. In March, news came to them that the Saints were being driven out of Missouri. After considering the many wrongs and atrocities Church members had endured, Joseph pled with the Lord:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–2]<br><br>The Lord responded to the Prophet:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>During the times leading up to the wrongful arrest and imprisonment of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Saints had endured much. They had been driven from their homes at least five times in less than 10 years; they saw some members abused or murdered; they had endured terrible sufferings--and all because of their religious beliefs.<br><br>Yet, despite this, the Lord told the Prophet:<br><br><i>If fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:7–8]<br><br>As I think of the words of the hymn "There Is a Green Hill Far Away," I think this verse is particularly appropriate:<br><br><i>Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!</i><br><i>And we must love him too,</i><br><i>And trust in his redeeming blood,</i><br><i>And try his works to do.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 194]<br><br>Generally speaking, the persecutions faced by the early Saints are no longer with us. Yet we all have trials and tribulations to face in our lives. It is vital, therefore, that we be well prepared and filled with a spiritual reservoir that we can carry with us and that will be available to help us.<br><h2><b>Elements of a Spiritual Parachute</b></h2><br>As a pilot during World War II, President Boyd K. Packer was taught by his instructors to always wear his parachute when flying. At that time parachute packs were large and uncomfortable to wear. The rule was frequently seen by most pilots as a nuisance. Yet as President Packer learned of colleagues escaping from their damaged or burning aircraft only to be saved by their parachutes, he realized what wise counsel he had been given.<br><br>We are all in need of a spiritual parachute in this world today--one that we can carry with us at all times, one that will protect us when we face personal trial and adversity, and one that will bring us peace when all about us are confounded.<br><br>Our spiritual parachute has many elements that make up a wonderful protective canopy we can use in times of great difficulty. Today I will mention seven of those elements:<br><br>1.<i>Follow the prophets.</i>We know that we live in challenging and difficult times with the world in commotion. We are in constant need of spiritual direction from trusted sources. Several times a year we sustain fifteen Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. We listen to them at general conference and read their words in Church magazines. They are a trusted source of wise counsel and direction. We would do well to heed their words.<br><br>I want to remind you that words of safety come from the prophets. We must make sure that we follow them. I bear testimony to you that they are inspired men who care for you and want you to have peace and happiness in your life.<br><br>2.<i>Be ye clean.</i>To the early Saints the Lord declared: "Go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 38:42).<br><br>President Hinckley has been very specific in his comments on this subject. He said: "Stay away from pornography as you would avoid a serious disease. It is as destructive. It can become habitual, and those who indulge in it get so they cannot leave it alone. It is addictive" (in<i>CR,</i>April 1998, 67; or "Living Worthy of the Girl You Will Someday Marry,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 49).<br><br>Have you followed the prophet's counsel in this regard? If you have, then I commend you for your wisdom. If you have not, then now is the time to act. You cannot have peace in your life if you have allowed the insidious influence of pornography to envelop your life. Get help. Get out of the "mist of darkness" (1 Nephi 8:23) and back onto that right path that will lead to eternal life.<br><br>3.<i>Honesty is the best policy.</i>The older I get, the more I realize that being honest in our dealings with others is a principle we must live by (see Articles of Faith 1:13). Throughout my life I have witnessed acts of honesty that have required courage. Sometimes in business there can be a temptation to be dishonest to close a sale. Some say that it is all right to be less than honest. It is not. Once the reputation for dishonesty is generally known, it is very hard for the individual to be trusted again. Honesty is a character trait that should be at the very foundation of our lives.<br><br>You will recall how the people of Ammon--Lamanite converts in the Book of Mormon--"were . . . distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end" (Alma 27:27). These Saints transmitted their righteousness to their children. These children later became the stripling young warriors who saved the Nephite nation.<br><br>4.<i>Keep the Sabbath day holy.</i>When we fail to keep the Sabbath day holy, we fail the test set by the Lord. To some it may seem like a little thing. What we are talking about is one of the Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20:8). It is very important. We will be blessed by the Lord if we live exactly in this regard.<br><br>By keeping the Sabbath day holy we build for ourselves spiritual character. It is not always easy to avoid the temptations of the world, but there is peace and safety in doing so. Sometimes those we call close friends will encourage us to ignore this very important commandment. However, by observing it we will have power over evil, we will be more spiritual, and we will keep ourselves unspotted from the sins of the world (see D&amp;amp;C 59:9).<br><br>The Sabbath day provides us an opportunity to step away from the world for one day to restore our spirituality so that we can get through the other six days.<br><br>5.<i>Read and ponder the scriptures, and pray often.</i>Elder Henry B. Eyring taught us at October conference:<br><br><i>If you ponder the scriptures and begin to do what you covenanted with God to do, I can promise you that you will feel more love for God and more of His love for you. And with that, your prayers will come from the heart, full of thanks and of pleading. You will feel a greater dependence on God. You will find the courage and the determination to act in His service, without fear and with peace in your heart.</i>["Prayer,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 17]<br><br>There is great power in pondering the scriptures. Those who do this have the right to inspiration and revelation to guide them.<br><br>6.<i>Serve others.</i>As true followers of Jesus Christ, we should practice what we preach. The scriptures teach, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves" (James 1:22).<br><br>We know that actions speak louder than words and we understand that the true measure for our service is found in the Savior's words: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these . . . , ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>Let us strive to give of ourselves through service to others. We cannot remain aloof from the needs and sufferings of others. No matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, there is always an opportunity for us to serve. A wise man once said, "The man who lives by himself and for himself is apt to be corrupted by the company he keeps" (Charles Henry Parkhurst, quoted in<i>The International Dictionary of Thoughts</i>[Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Company, 1969], 659).<br><br>7.<i>Keep the commandments.</i>Elder Dallin H. Oaks has counseled:<br><br><i>The blessings of the gospel are universal, and so is the formula for peace: keep the commandments of God. War and conflict are the result of wickedness; peace is the product of righteousness. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Each citizen furthers the cause of world peace when he or she keeps the commandments of God and lives at peace with family and neighbors. . . .</i><br><br><i>What can one person do to promote world peace? The answer is simple: keep God's commandments, and serve his children.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>March–April 1990, 92–93; or "World Peace,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1990, 72–73]<br><br>Why do you suppose the Brethren spend so much of their time helping you with guidance and direction? I hope you recognize that they care for your spiritual welfare.<br><h2><b>All Suffer Trials and Tribulations</b></h2><br>Members of the Church of Jesus Christ are not free from trial and tribulation. When the pioneers crossed the plains in the early days of the Church, Eliza R. Snow wrote the hymn "Think Not, When You Gather to Zion." I find the words very appropriate:<br><br><i>Think not when you gather to Zion,</i><br><i>Your troubles and trials are through,</i><br><i>That nothing but comfort and pleasure</i><br><i>Are waiting in Zion for you:</i><br><i>No, no, 'tis designed as a furnace,</i><br><i>All substance, all textures to try,</i><br><i>To burn all the "wood, hay, and stubble,"<br>The gold from the dross purify.</i><br><br><i>Think not when you gather to Zion,</i><br><i>That all will be holy and pure;</i><br><i>That fraud and deception are banished,</i><br><i>And confidence wholly secure:</i><br><i>No, no, for the Lord our Redeemer</i><br><i>Has said that the tares with the wheat</i><br><i>Must grow till the great day of burning<br>Shall render the harvest complete.</i><br><br><i>Think not when you gather to Zion,</i><br><i>The Saints here have nothing to do</i><br><i>But to look to your personal welfare,</i><br><i>And always be comforting you.</i><br><i>No; those who are faithful are doing</i><br><i>What they find to do with their might;</i><br><i>To gather the scattered of Israel<br>They labor by day and by night.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1948, no. 21]<br><br>In her book<i>Adversity,</i>author Elaine Cannon recalls a moment from the life of Sister Freda Joan Lee, who was mourning the death of her husband, President Harold B. Lee. Sister Cannon writes:<br><br><i>Sister Lee sobbed and said, "The world is mourning a prophet, but I have lost my husband. And I have had him such a short time."</i><br><br><i>Sister Lee, since then deceased herself, was in her sixties when she married President Lee, following the death of his first wife, and she comforted countless numbers of single girls with this hope. Thinking of separation now, plus a stretch of loneliness ahead proved a consuming trial for her. She who had comforted so many now stood on the uncomfortable threshold of despair herself.</i><br><br><i>Later, lonely and struggling to understand the untimely death of her husband who had been President of the Church for a brief eighteen months, Sister Lee sat in church on the back bench. She had a prayer in her heart for peace. In the midst of her affliction she turned to God for a way back up and out of anguish.</i><br><br><i>Then the closing song was sung. It was "Though Deepening Trials"</i>[Eliza R. Snow's great hymn of hope in the Savior].<i>The last verse particularly comforted her:</i><br><br><i>Lift up your hearts in praise to God;<br>Let your rejoicings never cease.<br>Though tribulations rage abroad,<br>Christ says, "In me ye shall have peace."</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 122]<br><br><i>"By the time we sang that last verse," said Sister Lee, "a wonderful lifting assurance had welled up within me. I was at peace. The Comforter had come. All would be well."</i>[Elaine Cannon,<i>Adversity</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1987), 117–18]<br><br>There are a number of lessons we can learn from Sister Lee's experience. Note how Sister Lee attended her Church meetings even though she was greatly troubled by the passing of her husband. Note how she had a prayer in her heart. She knew her peace would come from God. She was alert and attentive during the meeting. Note, too, how her answer was found in the words of a simple hymn. In her humility, she recognized the answer when it came to her.<br><br>Each week we have the opportunity to renew our covenants when we partake of the sacrament. Because this happens so often, it is easy to overlook the profound promises made there. For our part, we promise our Eternal Father that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of His Son, always remember Him, and keep His commandments. In return, we are promised that we will always have His Spirit with us (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79). As you face a week out in the world, can you imagine having a more comforting promise?<br><br>It is vital to our well-being that we partake of the sacrament worthily. By doing so and by keeping the covenants we make, we are building our reserves of strength for times of need. We are also becoming a better people. We will stand as beacons to those around us. We will recognize the quiet confidence that comes to those who faithfully live the gospel. We will have confidence in our ability to answer questions and help with the concerns of others. Others will look to us in times of trouble to help them. We will be able to help them find the peace of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>When answering questions from those around us, we should be kind to all with whom we talk, regardless of their race, culture, or beliefs. We should never be smug or self-righteous. We should act with love in our hearts, remembering that it is the gospel of Jesus Christ that provides the peace.<br><br>Can you now see that true world peace starts with you and me? We need to take care of the little things, and maybe some big things, too, if changes in life's direction are needed. It may require courage similar to that shown by my young friend Jeremy. It certainly requires a willingness to live the gospel of Jesus Christ in the face of increasing evil and worldliness, and a commitment to fearlessly hold up the beacon for others to follow.<br><br>As President Hinckley concluded general conference a few weeks ago, he said:<br><br><i>Now, brothers and sisters, we must do our duty, whatever that duty might be. Peace may be denied for a season. Some of our liberties may be curtailed. We may be inconvenienced. We may even be called on to suffer in one way or another. But God our Eternal Father will watch over this nation and all of the civilized world who look to Him. He has declared: "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord" (Ps. 33:12). Our safety lies in repentance. Our strength comes of obedience to the commandments of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Are these perilous times? They are. But there is no need to fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes. We can be an influence for good in this world, every one of us.</i><br><br><i>May the God of heaven, the Almighty, bless us, help us, as we walk our various ways in the uncertain days that lie ahead. May we look to Him with unfailing faith. May we worthily place our reliance on His Beloved Son who is our great Redeemer, whether it be in life or in death.</i>["The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 74]<br><h2><b>Personal Testimony</b></h2><br>I testify to you, my wonderful young friends, that peace does come as we live the gospel of Jesus Christ and follow the words of our living prophets when those trials, temptations, and worrisome times come in our lives.<br><br>I testify that in the essence of President Gordon B. Hinckley, whom I love with all my heart, we have a living prophet today who holds all of the keys of the kingdom. But it is my Savior, Jesus Christ, and my Father in Heaven, even God the Father, that I worship and whom I testify of to you.<br><br>I hope and pray that burning within your souls and your spirits is that hungering desire to have that testimony that will sustain you--the testimony that peace comes from Him who gave His life for us that we might live again, even Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, of which I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ben B. Banks was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 November 2001.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>rchal Blessing: A Message of Identity, Promise, and Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Devotionals are a remarkable feature of this university. I have come to appreciate their amazing value as they contribute to our learning, our spirituality, and our sense of community. It is an inspiring sight as we all make the trek from our various places across campus to this location each week. Our attendance reflects the desire of students, staff, and faculty alike to experience, during this brief interlude, thoughts and feelings that provide uplift, strength, and joy for our individual and collective lives. It is an equally awesome and inspiring sight as you flood into this building and take your places. I love to look into your faces and consider the power you represent. Indeed, you are a mighty army. You are being prepared to go forth into the world--even into its more remote corners--to perform a mighty work. You are not here by chance or by fortuitous circumstance. I hope you recognize that you have been given a very special opportunity, one that will bless you, your family, and your associates. I feel I have been so blessed.<br><br>I am thankful that my dear companion, Belva, is here with me. It is largely because of her that I stand before you today. As a young woman, as a senior in high school, she introduced me to the doctrines and the way of life of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She exemplified in her conduct what she taught with her speech. Her obedience, happiness, and righteousness radiated truth and beauty. Thus she gave me reason to seek knowledge and a testimony of the Church that gave obvious meaning and purpose to her life. Later these same virtues, so evident in her life and so pleasing to my soul, also caused me to seek to be worthy to be her husband and companion. In the 40-plus years of our acquaintance, friendship, and marriage, I have never had occasion to doubt her love or her goodness. She is a true disciple of our Lord and Savior. It is impossible for me to pay adequate tribute to her or to find words sufficient to express all she has brought and continues to bring into my life.<br><br>I have chosen to talk to you about patriarchal blessings. I made this choice even though I am reasonably certain that the majority of you have already received patriarchal blessings. Experience has taught me that there is much that we can learn about these blessings that will cause us to treasure them and learn from them even more than we might at present. As I consider the ways I have grown in appreciation for the patriarchal blessing I received 45 years ago, I realize that the more we know about them--about their source, nature, and purpose--the greater will be their value in our lives. Perhaps my main reason for choosing this topic has to do with my deeply positive feelings about these blessings. Just last Friday--as I shared a wonderful hour with a young man, Karl, who came for a blessing--I reflected on how fortunate I was to experience the love of the Lord as it has been manifest on such occasions.<br><br>It has been a great privilege and blessing to me to have served for 20 years as a patriarch. I know from countless experiences during those years that patriarchal blessings are communications given to us as personal revelations from God. These few words, recorded on perhaps a page or more, are remarkable. Their prophetic utterances have great power. They speak to our uncertainties, our abilities, our gifts, our life's experiences--all in the interest of assuring us of God's love and of His willingness to help us face the challenges and trials of our lives and to sustain us safely through what we must face. Although I have been richly blessed through my priesthood calling to know that these blessings are from God, I find that my own personal patriarchal blessing is also a very significant source of testimony to me that the Lord's servants speak prophetic words of truth and love to His children. To this day I continue to marvel at the ways in which the promises and statements in my blessing accurately foreshadow and give perspective to the experiences of my life. When I consider the contents of my patriarchal blessing, I am truly amazed at the manner in which the Lord has offered me such a tangible and sure way of knowing that He loves me, of recognizing that He knows me personally, and of trusting that He willingly leads me by the hand.<br><br>There is a parallel to be drawn, I believe, between an experience of Oliver Cowdery and the experience we may have with our blessings. In section 6 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read the words spoken to Oliver Cowdery by Joseph on behalf of the Lord. Oliver was told that he had been given instruction by the Holy Ghost that had led him to his present place. Further, he was reminded how he had inquired of the Lord and received enlightenment. After being informed that "there is none else save God that knowest [our] thoughts and the intents of [our] heart[s] (verse 16), Oliver was told how he could gain a further testimony that the Lord was speaking to him. The Lord then said to him:<br><br><i>Cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</i><br><br><i>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:22–23]<br><br>As Oliver later told David Whitmer, Oliver had never told anyone, not even Joseph, of this occasion to which the Lord referred. So when the Lord reminded him of this private moment, shared by and known only to Oliver and the Lord, Oliver knew the revelation was true. Thus he also knew that Joseph was who he claimed to be.<br><br>Within our patriarchal blessings are comparable statements given to us by our loving Father in Heaven. As the whisperings of the Holy Spirit enable us to see the promised blessings fulfilled in our lives, we, like Oliver, can know that such insight is God's gift and His witness to us: a personal way of knowing the truth of the blessing, of the priesthood, and of the message of the Restoration.<br><br>In March 1980 Elder James E. Faust spoke from this same platform to a BYU fireside audience on the subject of patriarchal blessings. He indicated that his "chief reason for speaking upon this subject [was] that patriarchal blessings verify the divinity of Christ and the truthfulness of the Church" ("Patriarchal Blessings," 30 March 1980, in<i>BYU 1980 Devotional Speeches of the Year</i>[Provo: BYU, 1981], 53). I hope that the treatment of this same subject today will help lead us to consider "the divinity of Christ and the truthfulness of the Church."<br><br>As we think about our patriarchal blessing and about the Lord who has given it, I hope we will recognize and value our blessing as a gift from God. The perspective of a blessing as a gift enables us to more fully appreciate what has been given to us. We have all had experience receiving gifts. Perhaps you can recall times when you were given a gift that was exactly what you wanted. You may have retained and prized such a gift for many years. Maybe there have been times when you have received a gift that was not what you had hinted or pleaded for. Perhaps you overcame your initial disappointment and eventually realized that the giver knew the value of the gift or understood your needs and interests better than you knew yourself.<br><br>I encourage you to recall your experience with such gifts to understand more fully how you may regard your own patriarchal blessing. In doing so you may consider scriptural references pertaining to spiritual gifts. Especially helpful is the instruction in Moroni 10 in which Moroni instructs us to avoid denying the power of God (verse 7). Then he admonishes us to avoid denying the gifts of God (verse 8). As we reflect on these directives, we need to think seriously how it is that we may be denying God and His gifts in the way we regard and use our blessings. One clue--one closely related to Elder Faust's purpose in speaking about patriarchal blessings--is found in the next part of Moroni's message. He tells us that there are many gifts and that "they come from the same God" (verse 8). Especially pertinent is this following observation: "They are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them" (verse 8). Our challenge, then, as the recipient of a gift of God, is to acknowledge Him as the source, having faith that He knows the gift that will be of the greatest value or benefit to us.<br><br>Two experiences come to my mind that illustrate contrasting attitudes on this matter of "deny[ing] not the gifts of God." The first occurred nearly 15 years ago in our home in Edmonton. A young woman--about 20 years of age and already a single parent--came for a blessing accompanied by her mother. This young woman had made some mistakes, but through the help of a loving family and a caring bishop, she had reoriented and changed her life, thereby reestablishing her worthiness before the Lord. As I began voicing her blessing, I found myself focusing on the welfare program of the Church, speaking to her of the importance of incorporating the principles of frugality, payment of tithes and offerings, preparedness, industriousness, and avoidance of debt more fully into her life. So dominant was this theme in her blessing and so different from prior blessings I had voiced that I tried to direct my mind and speech to other topics. Still the blessing continued in the same vein. When the blessing concluded I was somewhat apprehensive. I worried as to how this girl and her mother might react, and I wondered whether or not they would be disappointed. Welcome was the response. To my grateful surprise, both were elated. Both were emotionally overcome and obviously thrilled with the blessing.<br><br>As though she sensed my thoughts and feelings, the mother of the young woman proceeded to explain their response. Many years earlier the mother, then a young woman living in the house of her mother, had been taught the message of the restored gospel by the missionaries. These two women--the mother and grandmother of the young woman who had just received her blessing--did not immediately gain testimonies of the truth of the missionaries' message. They liked what they heard, but conviction and testimony were absent. They asked the missionaries to continue teaching them about the Church, which, as you can imagine, the missionaries happily agreed to do. Several weeks later, during one of their lessons, the missionaries described the welfare program of the Church, highlighting the importance of self-reliance, preparedness, and care of the poor and needy. Immediately upon hearing the lesson the two women asked to be baptized. They knew they had found the truth. That message so resonated with their personal beliefs and behaviors that they knew the gospel was true. As the daughter who had heard that message came to be a mother herself, raising her daughter, she, like her mother before her, had made these teachings a significant part of their lives. She concluded, "There is no other subject that as the dominant theme of my daughter's blessing could have given her and me greater personal assurance that this blessing came from God. Only He could have known its dear and special meaning in our lives."<br><br>A contrasting experience occurred while I was serving as a patriarch here on BYU campus, when a young woman came for a blessing accompanied by her parents. During the time we shared that day, this young woman received a wonderful blessing assuring her of abundant and powerful gifts she would enjoy at the hand of the Lord. Unknown to me, this young woman and her parents were anxiously hoping for one particular blessing. An older daughter in this family had died before marriage and childbearing, and the parents had noted that there had been no mention of marriage or children in that daughter's blessing. They therefore had reached the conclusion that the absence of these subjects in her blessing foreshadowed her death before marriage. Thus they anxiously waited to hear the words<i>eternal marriage</i>in this second daughter's blessing, but these words were not spoken.<br><br>The family said nothing at the time but agonized all the way home that the blessing had not included the promise of marriage. No sooner did they arrive home than they telephoned me. So focused were they on the hope for a promise of marriage, so eager to hear the exact words, they were unable to appreciate the loving and generous promises contained in the blessing the girl had received. I tried to reassure them in a number of ways. First, I cited statements of the Brethren that the absence of reference to a specific blessing does not mean the blessing will not be given. Second, I pointed out that even if a specific promise of eternal marriage had been stated, there was no assurance that it would be fulfilled in mortality. Third, I noted that the wonderful promises of her blessing, so rich and so plentiful, should afford them great joy and strong personal assurance that their daughter would live to receive all the blessings they desired for her.<br><br>Despite my best efforts to help them see that the blessing was a beautiful gift from the Lord, their hearts were so set on hearing a particular promise that they remained somewhat disappointed. Because of the goodness of this family, I am sure that by now they have come to see God's hand in the gift to their daughter. Their initial reaction, however, in sharp contrast to that of the young woman I first mentioned, denied the gifts of God and made it difficult for them to see this blessing as a manifestation of God's love for her, reducing her opportunity to profit from the blessing, as Moroni has counseled us to do.<br><br>These two experiences illustrate other observations made by Elder Faust about patriarchal blessings. He counseled:<br><br><i>A patriarchal blessing is a sacred guideline of counsel, promises, and information from the Lord. However, a person should not expect that the blessing will detail all that will happen to him or her, or be an answer to all questions. The omission of the blessing of a great event in life such as a mission or marriage does not mean it will not happen.</i>[Faust, "Patriarchal Blessings," 54]<br><br>He added this reassuring thought: "My own blessing is short and is limited to perhaps three quarters of one page on one side, yet it has been completely adequate and perfect for me" (p. 54).<br><br>Often when people come for a patriarchal blessing I ask them to share with me their knowledge about and understanding of the blessing they are about to receive. Once I have heard their response, I try to enrich and clarify what is usually a fairly sketchy understanding.<br><br>Besides affirming the source of the blessing and expressing the hope that they will value the Lord's gift, I usually try to teach them three additional points:<br><br>1. Patriarchal blessings help us understand our identity.<br><br>2. They provide prophetic promises that help us recognize God's hand in our lives.<br><br>3. They convey to us the love and goodness of the Lord, assuring us of His ready and constant availability in our lives.<br><br>An essential component of each patriarchal blessing is a statement of lineage that generally connects us to God by designating for us a place in the family of Israel, commonly of the tribe of Ephraim or Manassah. Scriptural statements help us understand why these two tribes--those of the sons of Joseph--dominate the lineal inheritances of modern Israel. But rather than elaborating on these matters, I wish to speak on why this statement of lineage is such a vital part of our patriarchal blessing.<br><br>In the priesthood manual<i>The Kingdom of God,</i>the comment is made that the statement of lineage "is the most important element of [a] patriarchal blessing" (Oscar W. McConkie, Jr.,<i>The Kingdom of God</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1962], 248). Would you in thinking about your blessing have arrived at a similar conclusion? Why is this claim made about the importance of our lineage?<br><br>In appreciating this select status given to the statement of lineage, I have found it useful to draw from an experience presented in the book and movie entitled<i>Roots.</i>For those unfamiliar with either the book or the subsequent movie version of the story, I should explain that the author, Alex Haley, traces the history of his African-American family back seven generations to the ancestor who was torn from his home on the African continent and brought to America as a slave to be bought and sold as human merchandise, to be denied fundamental human rights, and, most significant to him, to be denied his family and tribal identity.<br><br>This noble and proud man, Kunte Kinte, fiercely maintained an allegiance to both his biological and cultural roots. Armed with a strong sense of his own identity that was firmly established prior to his rude induction into slavery, this brave and defiant man offered to his posterity a way of seeing themselves that was in sharp contrast to their slavery. On the night his daughter was born, this wise father held the infant aloft under the beautiful starlit sky and declared, "Thou art Kizzie, daughter of Kunte Kinte, son of the great Mandinka warrior." Thus he established the identity so significant to him that he wanted her to share. As this child grew she was taught the meaning embedded in her father's blessing. He wanted her to know about her people in Africa, to know that "she was not born to be a slave in the white folk's land." Her image of her "self," in significant contrast to the demeaning, degrading image associated with her status as a slave, enabled her to overcome great adversity and to, in turn, offer to her descendants a similar gift. (See part 3 of<i>Roots,</i>1977.)<br><br>The statement of lineage contained within our patriarchal blessings offers us a comparable treasure. By declaring our place in the family of Israel, our Heavenly Father informs us who we are. We need not consider ourselves subject to the ephemeral, material, and superficial images promoted by the world. Through a simple statement of lineage, we are given a message of profound significance. Our sights are elevated, our vision is expanded, and our understanding is deepened. We are helped to see ourselves in noble and powerful terms. Those who enjoy the status of membership in Israel should know that they have distinguished themselves in the premortal existence.<br><br>This eternal vision of self should stir our imaginations and give power and majesty to our hopes and aspirations. What does it matter how we measure up according to the worldly metrics of wealth, power, intelligence, or beauty? By confirming our status as children of Israel, God has declared our entitlement to the potential to become even like our Savior through His great redeeming gift. Worldly images pale in comparison. The more we study and understand about the nature and gifts of Israel, the greater will be our appreciation of the statement in our blessings that acknowledges our place in this blessed family. I hope we will all, my brothers and sisters, give serious study to the nature and blessings of Israel. Seek to perceive yourself among this select group who gained distinction in the premortal existence, who are sought after and gathered by God as He has promised, and who are offered a gift of incomparable value, even the gift of eternal life. You will feel the powerful effects of seeing and knowing yourself as God knows you. It is no wonder to me that this statement of identity and promise should have preeminent place in patriarchal blessings.<br><br>In addition to the statement of lineage, which offers to us the possibility of receiving what God Himself refers to as "the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7), our patriarchal blessings typically offer us prophetic promises pertaining to our life's experiences, both mortal and postmortal. They may mention virtues we may acquire, service we may render, pathways we may traverse, gifts we may receive, or instruction we should heed. These prophetic statements in our blessing can be likened to prophetic statements in the scriptures. Very often their exact and full meaning is hidden from our view until we recognize the whisperings of the Spirit confirming that they have been fulfilled. Through obedient and righteous living, members of the Lord's church may enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost, who empowers us to see and acknowledge these signs for what they are. Similarly, the whisperings of the Spirit confirm to us that the prophetic promises of God to us are being realized and we should rejoice as we recognize each gift. Further, though, and perhaps of greater importance, through the spiritual sense that reveals the fulfillment of these prophetic promises we may be enabled to perceive greater truth. As President Joseph F. Smith observed, as he spoke of recognizing the signs of Christ's second coming, we may know that "the Lord's hand is over all. . . . He will control the results that will follow. He will overrule them in a way that you and I, today, do not comprehend, or do not foresee, for ultimate good" (<i>GD,</i>89). These signs, both those pertaining to the second coming of Christ and those pertaining to our individual lives as enunciated in our blessings, become like mileposts or benchmarks. As we recognize in them the realization of God's promises, we develop greater faith that His hand is over all and that He will lead us to the ultimate good--the promise of eternal life.<br><br>Last, but by no means least, these blessings are a testament of God's love for each of His children. They reveal the uniqueness of each of us, and they highlight the fact that God sees in us what we do not see in one another or in ourselves. You will recall the experience of Samuel, the Old Testament prophet who was commissioned by the Lord to find and anoint the future king of Israel from among the sons of Jesse. Each of seven sons passed before Samuel, and the Lord still did not reveal the future king. Samuel asked Jesse if there were other sons. He replied, "There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep" (1 Samuel 16:11). David was summoned and anointed. During the process of selection the Lord told Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature, . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (verse 7). As we consider the things revealed to us in our blessings, we must remind ourselves that even we do not see ourselves as the Lord sees us. Our blessings, given to us as an expression of the Lord's love for us as His children, are intended to help us see ourselves in a unique and special way. No matter how unreal certain insights and promises might appear to us, we should not disbelieve.<br><br>This was taught to me rather forcefully shortly after I commenced voicing patriarchal blessings. It is repeated and reinforced each time I voice a blessing now after 20 years. The occasion I refer to happened on an evening when a young man in our stake came for a blessing accompanied by his parents. When I greeted him and shook his hand, I sensed before me a young man who was unsure of himself and hesitant to make eye contact, to converse, or to be engaging in any fashion. To complete this somewhat inauspicious first impression, he had forgotten his recommend. I truly wondered what he would hear that evening.<br><br>Eventually we were able to proceed with the blessing. The blessing was remarkable in the way it contrasted with what I had seen in the young man. I learned that I had inappropriately and unwisely judged him. He was soon to leave on a mission. In the blessing he was told of gifts he would develop and of leadership he would offer to fellow missionaries, to Church members, and to those he would teach. They would seek him out--even those many years his senior--for his wise counsel. Much was said of his abilities, his spiritual gifts, and his capacity to bless others. Two years later, as I walked through a wedding reception line, I encountered him again, freshly returned from his mission. He was a different young man. Already the promised blessings were evident. The story does not end there. Just recently I learned of his appointment to the faculty here at BYU. The news reminded me of that evening and of the powerful lesson I learned through him. Truly the Lord saw what was not readily apparent to me at the moment. I am grateful that this man's life, through his obedience to and love for the Lord, has enabled him to experience fulfillment of his promise.<br><br>A rich variety of people seek patriarchal blessings. Some are converts, others are born in the covenant. Some have lived obedient and pure lives, whereas others have sinned seriously and have sought and gained forgiveness. Some are relatively young, others are elderly. Some are bright and learned, and others have a lesser endowment or schooling. However varied, they share a universal gift in these blessings: God's love for all of His children is unequivocal and unconditional. These patriarchal blessings are a way of knowing in a deeply personal and profound manner that regardless of our circumstance, fortune, or status, we are endowed with the great love of God. This knowledge should encourage, sustain, and lift us. Even in our times of heartfelt loneliness, discouragement, or trial, we should be able to turn to our blessing and hear the quiet yet reassuring voice of the Lord saying, "I love you."<br><br>I know these things to be true. I know that God lives and that He desires to bless His children. Patriarchal blessings are one of the many ways we may know this in a very powerful and personal way. I am thankful to serve as a patriarch here at BYU among you students. I know you are a royal generation, one being prepared for a noble and great work. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen.<br><br><i>Robert S. Patterson was the dean of the David O.

<h1>rtance of Asking Questions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for but also somewhat intimidated by this assignment to be with you today. The mission of Brigham Young University is unique in all the world, and I have great admiration and respect for those who really understand this mission and are absolutely committed to it. Although all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are motivated to learn, gain knowledge, and increase in wisdom and intelligence, those who have the privilege of being associated with this remarkable institution and its sister schools are uniquely positioned and greatly blessed to acquire the attributes and understandings that lead to the advancement of "the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br>One of the key ways that we learn--not only here at BYU but throughout life--is by asking questions. I am sure that your parents can attest to the fact that you have been asking questions--some of them difficult to answer--since your first capacity to utter coherent sentences. Your questions have continued, as they should, and even your professors learn about you by asking you questions. It is about the general notion of questions that I would like to focus my comments and counsel today.<br><br>Sir John Lubbock was an English banker, statesman, naturalist, and prolific writer born in 1834. In an essay entitled "National Education" he made a statement that has particular relevance for us in this special university environment:<br><br><i>There are three great questions which in life we have over and over again to answer. Is it right or wrong? Is it true or false? Is it beautiful or ugly? Our education ought to help us to answer these questions.</i>[Sir John Lubbock,<i>The Use of Life</i>(1894; reprint, Freeport, New York: Books for Libraries Press, 1972), 102–3]<br><br>Had Sir John Lubbock known, perhaps he might have best said, "Our education at BYU<i>especially</i>ought to help us answer these questions."<br><br>Some seem to believe that faith and questions are antithetical. Such could not be further from the truth. The Restoration itself was unfolded by the proper and necessary melding of both. The Prophet Joseph Smith had both faith and questions. Indeed, the passage of scripture that led Joseph to the Sacred Grove experience includes both a question and the promise of an answer based on the asker's faith.<br><br>I marvel each time I consider the wonderful way in which the Prophet Joseph Smith used proper questions not only to enhance his knowledge but also to enlarge his faith. You know of his First Vision experience. Those of you who have served as missionaries have recounted it many, many times. Even after these many years since I was a young missionary, I am moved by rereading his history frequently and commend it to you for your regular reexamination.<br><br>In his history Joseph Smith described his family circumstances and the religious environment in which he grew up as a young boy. He was exposed to significant religious fervor and difference of opinion among the various denominations, all proclaiming to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to have the truth. Let me pick up his account:<br><br><i>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?</i>[Joseph Smith--History 1:10]<br><br>I would submit to you that these three questions constitute much more than Joseph's passive curiosity. They allowed him to focus on resolving his own personal dilemma and also prepared him to have that experience so critical to the lives of all of us. Let me return to Joseph's history:<br><br><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads:</i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. [JS--H 1:11; emphasis in original]<br><br>While the Prophet Joseph Smith did not go on to share the following verses in his formal history, we should remember that they are vital components in receiving the answers to the questions that Joseph posed as well the ones we might ask ourselves. Let me continue with the narrative of James:<br><br><i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</i><br><br><i>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</i>[James 1:6–8]<br><br>The operative phrase "but let him ask in faith" gives a basic secret. Faith without wavering is necessary for receiving the answers we desire. Although faith is absolutely essential in obtaining answers to the questions we ask through prayer, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the Father's plan is also helpful in obtaining the answers to other important questions that we would ask.<br><br>Before we leave the Prophet Joseph Smith's history, it is instructive to consider other queries posed by the young prophet during these formative years of the restoration of the gospel. One of the fundamental truths about asking proper questions in faith and in the proper way is that the answer received may not be that which was expected or hoped for, and sometimes is even an answer to a more important or fundamental question than we had thought to ask. Again quoting from the experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)--and which I should join.</i>[JS--H 1:18]<br><br>Note the pointed answer that he received: "I was answered that I must join none of them" (verse 19), followed by the explanation known to all of us in that same verse. After this clarification, Joseph reported:<br><br><i>He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. . . . It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?</i>[JS--H 1:20]<br><br>Joseph Smith, though very young, reflexively understood another important principle related to proper questions. I refer to the questions that he asked himself as he tried to understand the answers he had received from the Father and the Son. Let us again return to Joseph's words:<br><br><i>It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself. . . .</i><br><br><i>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</i>[JS--H 1:23, 25]<br><br>These are good questions. Joseph Smith then mentions something of the challenges that were consistent in his life for the next period of years and again reports an experience derived from his proper questioning:<br><br><i>On the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.</i>[JS--H 1:29]<br><br>We then know of the events with the angel Moroni that occupied that entire night as well as the next day, and the tremendous import they had--not only for Joseph Smith but for all of us with the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Speaking of the translation of the Book of Mormon, we recognize that Joseph's capacity to ask and his understanding of the importance of proper questions was honed and developed during this period of time. Let me draw your attention to his words again:<br><br><i>We</i>[meaning Joseph and Oliver Cowdery]<i>still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates. While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us.</i>[JS--H 1:68]<br><br>We know that this is when Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood, given instruction as to how baptism would properly be performed and how they should be baptized, and also taught and given promises about other great and significant events that were about to transpire in their lives and in the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>We could spend much more time than we have allotted to us today in giving other examples where the Prophet Joseph Smith asked the appropriate questions and received the doctrinal insights and understandings that are so precious to us in our day. One need only peruse the Doctrine and Covenants and recognize that, in fact, virtually all of these revelations--both to individuals and to the Church generally--came in response to carefully reasoned and faith-laden supplications to our Father in Heaven. But even with the importance of these good questions, we must remember, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, "There are more good answers than we have good questions" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], 9).<br><br>Do questions that do not have this same general impact or doctrinal significance still have a place in our lives? I hope that the answer is an obvious yes. Ours is a gospel of questions, and our lives in all of their spheres require thoughtful and appropriate inquiry if we are going to progress. The question is not whether we should ask questions but rather, What are the questions we should be asking?<br><br>My experience in science and medicine leads me to believe that real progress is almost always the result of asking the right questions. If important answers to questions are to be forthcoming from our striving, then the proper questions need to be asked. Even when correct answers or valuable insights are available, they do not usually occur when wrong questions or no questions are asked. Many scientists can relate experiences when they or others made important discoveries seemingly by serendipity. When this was the case, they still concur that the welcome knowledge came as the result of carefully crafted inquiry even if the resulting answer was not to the question asked.<br><br>When we discount questions that are silly, inappropriate, tasteless, or nonsensical, we still have to acknowledge that all questions that could be construed as proper in at least some settings are not equally salient. Some questions have great proximate significance without having any lasting importance, such as: Where will I find a place to park before my next class? or What should we have for lunch? or What will I wear to the important party this coming weekend? One of the mistakes that may be made by those who pride themselves on their inquiring minds is to focus on "small questions" to the exclusion of the "great ones." Some get so caught up in minute details that they may miss out on the big picture. Though there may be nothing wrong with many questions in themselves, it is also true that focusing on the trivial can lead us away from the significant.<br><br>I don't know what kind of shoes the Prophet Joseph Smith wore, or even if he wore shoes when he made his trip to the Sacred Grove. I suppose that there might be historians or cultural anthropologists or even shoemakers who might be interested in that question. There is nothing wrong with asking that question, and it might even lead to a publication in a learned journal if the answer is found. What is really important, however, is that Joseph went to the grove and had his sacred experience that literally changed the world.<br><br>Even when we are trying to think clearly and ask careful questions, it is easy to become distracted. It may be tempting sometimes to look for the question to ask that seems controversial or sensational or perhaps that no one has previously thought to pose. Likewise it is sometimes alluring to ask a question or questions that will consciously deflect one from asking the right or important or central question when it is known or suspected that the critical answer might to be too hard or too compelling. It is also possible to frame a question that is so oblique or complicated--not to mention nonsensical--to make an answer virtually impossible. I remember the query of the old-time comedian who liked to ask: "What is the difference between a duck?" To puzzled listeners he would then give the answer: "Its leg is both the same." If we are not careful, our questions and answers may not be much better.<br><br>If we can accept that questions are not only acceptable but are also essential, then we can move to determining what are ultimately the best or most vitally important questions. These would be those that deal with central or core truths or issues. There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to know the answer to a question just because it exists, but it is almost always more productive to have a clear purpose in mind or problem to solve when asking a question.<br><br>For example, some geneticists may be willing to work for a long time on identifying the chemical sequence of a particular gene just because it is there. On the other hand, that search becomes much more compelling for most when it is known that a particular gene has a significant role in a specific characteristic, problem, or disease. Knowing chemical formulas or structures of compounds or substances will contribute to the total body of knowledge, but these facts do not usually help much in fighting cancer if one spends all his time on sequencing genes that have to do with something else. It isn't that the other thing isn't interesting or even vital, but it likely will not lead to understanding what happens in the cells and organs that leads to cancer and eventually death, unless that other phenomenon is in some way linked to the cancer gene or mechanism. Likewise, studying a map of Scotland may be fascinating and even educational, but it will not be helpful if you are traveling to China.<br><br>Our scientific colleagues here on campus will tell us that usually they have the most success in advancing or gaining more knowledge by building on the work or the truths that have already been discovered by others. Today's geneticists who are unraveling the secrets of the genes and their role in disease do not have to duplicate the foundational genetic experiments of many years ago performed by Mendel and others, or the theoretical modeling of DNA structure suggested by Watson and Crick. Rather, they gratefully consider the work, theories, and discoveries of those who have gone before, then study them and come to know of their significance and limitations for themselves. Building on the contributions of others, they move on to solve new problems and focus on those of most relevance for our own time.<br><br>We can also benefit from those who have gone before in obtaining answers to our important questions. We don't need to have a personal First Vision experience because Joseph Smith already had it, and we have his account and his testimony, together with the confirming witness of the Holy Ghost and of countless others. We don't need to visit with Moroni and learn what he taught Joseph Smith because we have the scriptural record that has been provided. None of us attended the Sermon on the Mount in the Holy Land, but we didn't need to be there because we have the New Testament account available to us, together with the special insights added in 3 Nephi and, most important, the tools and mechanisms to know for ourselves that those teachings are true.<br><br>We are not afraid of any questions. That assertion does not mean that the answers to all of them are available or that those that are, are of equal value. In fact, faith is such a profound principle and so necessary for us to accomplish all that we must do that details of interest or importance will always be kept in the realm of faith. Think of the responses of Book of Mormon prophets to either their own questions or questions posed to them. Do you remember honest Nephi's response when asked the question "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" He answered, "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Nephi 11:16–17).<br><br>Not only do we acknowledge to ourselves and to the Lord when we don't know the answers to questions that are posed, but we need to admit we don't know to others when appropriate. In teaching his son Helaman, Alma made this clear as they discussed some important doctrinal points: "Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear" (Alma 37:11).<br><br>In our humility about what we don't know, however, we must never equivocate about the inescapable data that have been made available to each of us as the basis for our faith. Of the many examples that we might advance, perhaps the most compelling is the Book of Mormon itself. Whatever is thought of its origin, the fact is that we have it. We can lift it, we can read it, we can test it and examine it. If we are honest, we must reach definite conclusions about it. In brief, it is either true or it is the product of a fraud. Either it is the word of God or it is an imposter of the foulest rank. It is neither intellectually honest nor rationally plausible that its contents would be found to be good and its testimonies true and yet its origins fraudulent. Whatever others may think of the the explanation of the origins of the Book of Mormon as given by Joseph Smith, think carefully of the probabilities of the truth of any of the alternate explanations that have been advanced. Remember, we have had more than 170 years of multiple theories advanced by the Prophet's detractors, and each alternative has been discredited by careful and honest evaluators. You, of course, will want to examine this issue carefully yourself--if you haven't already done so. But you have the advantage of all the work that has gone before and all of the questions that have been asked by others. There will always be, however, those who will criticize the scholarship of others who disagree as being uncritical in their thinking but will then ask that you accept as intuitively obvious their own spurious conclusions. Be sure you are always asking the right questions.<br><br>Whenever you are attempting to find the answer to a question of great importance, you should, when possible, go to the primary source. For example, you should feel free to read any commentaries about the Book of Mormon that you wish, but be sure that you spend adequate time reading the Book of Mormon itself directly and then ask the important question it asks you:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i>[Moroni 10:4–5]<br><br>This is a good place to start asking important questions because when you have the answer that the Book of Mormon is true, then of necessity some other important things are true. For example, since the Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith is then very clearly a prophet of God. Because Joseph is a prophet, then his other revelations are true. Because Joseph saw the Father and Jesus Christ, then many of our other questions about their nature and roles are answered. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church, and Joseph's successors in the presidency are also prophets of God. The Book of Mormon won't tell you much about the shoes that any of the great ones in their dispensation wore or the color of their hair--if they had any. It only tells you of the things that are most important and really true. Knowing the answer to the question of its truthfulness provides answers also to other subsidiary questions.<br><br>There will always still be questions we have, of course, and things we don't understand fully--and even some things we may not like very much. We will still have some fundamental things we will need to accept on faith. Even some of the details of the Book of the Mormon itself will always be in this realm. Though we continue to learn more about why it is increasingly impossible that one such as Joseph Smith could have written this scripture on his own and why the alternative explanations advanced for the book's origins are not credible, it is highly likely that the Lord will insist that this great witness of His hand in the affairs of His children will need to remain in the realm of faith so that we can demonstrate our faithfulness.<br><br>With all of the good questions that might be asked, which are the most significant? When we are considering proximate things like what to eat or wear, the answers, for good reason, may change often. When we ask the questions of ultimate significance like those pertaining to doctrine, however, the answers are stable and unchanging. I refer in this sense to questions more important even than what should be my major or my career. The world continues to soften its position on moral laws, but the seventh commandment and its associated principles will always stand, even if cures for AIDS and all venereal diseases were to become readily available. This is true of all the fundamental doctrines and the questions of most importance to you now and also through the eternities. Some questions and answers will be unique to you alone, and some are common to everyone. Let me refer to the scriptures for examples that apply to all of us.<br><br>Amulek was a wonderful, exemplary missionary and gospel teacher in his later life, but in his younger years this was not so. By his own admission, early in his life his priorities may not have been where they should have been. To his great credit, however, with some very significant help from Alma, he became what God expected him to become (see Alma 8 and 10). Coming from the perspective of his own trials and experiences, as well as being tutored by the Holy Ghost, he was able to understand "that the great question" in the minds of the people he was teaching was "whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ" (Alma 34:5). Jesus Himself got to this core question when He asked the Pharisees, "What think ye of Christ?" (Matthew 22:42).<br><br>Saul of Tarsus, who became the Apostle Paul, had his dramatic experience on the road to Damascus. Prior to that time, Saul, although apparently completely committed to the things that he believed, may not have asked the proper questions. It took a rather dramatic intervention to command his attention. Let me refer to the account in Acts 9:<br><br><i>And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</i><br><br><i>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</i>[Note again the role of questions in the way Jesus teaches.]<br><br><i>And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</i><br><br><i>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</i>[Acts 9:3–6]<br><br>Saul asked two very good questions in response to the inquiry of the Lord. In a sense his first question--"Who art thou, Lord?"--is the same question described by Amulek as "the great question." Saul's second query was the appropriate response to the Savior--who did not have to ask Saul directly, as He had the Pharisees, "What think ye of Christ?" Saul asked, "What wilt thou have me to do?" This was the immediate answer of one prepared "before the foundation of the world." Apparently, in an instant, an understanding or memory became very clear to Saul of the central truth described by the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>121]<br><br>We know with great appreciation what Paul became and did when his questions were answered. We might likewise consider that all of our questions--beyond the great one and its associated queries surrounding the Savior: the plan of salvation and our fundamental responsibilities in the kingdom of God--should be only appendages to these central truths. Some of these secondary or appendage questions might be very important to us for perfectly good reasons but might also not have much significance for others or even the Lord. The phrase "it mattereth not" is found more than once in both the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants. We need to be prepared when that is the answer to our petitions to the Lord and not be deflected from our responsibility to move forward and act on the answers we have already received.<br><br>Although the answer to some of our questions may be "it mattereth not," sometimes not only the answers but the questions themselves are pivotal and matter a great deal. It is vital for scientists to ask the right questions, but it is also important for us to do the same in all phases of our lives. A great temptation for even faithful Latter-day Saints is to occasionally consider the self-posed proposition that since I am unique or find myself in special extenuating circumstances, then a particular commandment or standard (meaning a previous answer from the Lord) does not really apply in my case--at least at this time. Over the years I have heard this rationalization often from those in various kinds of financial difficulty with respect to their tithes and offerings, but it is also a consideration for some with issues of honesty, the moral code, the Word of Wisdom, and so forth. The questions we ask ourselves in these circumstances are among the most important we will ever pose to anyone.<br><br>Asking how I may avoid or get around this or that commandment or principle is the wrong question. The much more appropriate question would be something like this: "I find myself in a difficult situation. Why has the Lord (or the Brethren or my parents or the university administration) given the counsel that has been given in these circumstances?"<br><br>Saul's response, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" is not only the safe question, it is the right one. As appropriate as this question is, however, it is not always easy to ask. In fact, the best answers often come when our challenges are the greatest.<br><br>Think of the tremendous suffering of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his associates in Liberty Jail during the cold, miserable winter of 1838–1839. Try to imagine the pathos of the suffering prophet and his pleas and almost desperate questions to the Lord:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>Out of this almost unthinkable misery, the Lord comforted Joseph both generally and with great specificity in answering his questions, including some that he didn't ask. The Lord was kind enough and clear enough, as He will be with each of us, to acknowledge His understanding of the circumstances (see D&amp;amp;C 121–123). But He then gave this stunning summary answer, in part with a key question: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:8).<br><br>Or think of the apparent rebuke felt by Peter, James, and John when they accompanied the Savior to the Garden of Gethsemane as the Atonement was unfolding. In the midst of His agony and profound prayer, those He might have expected to have the most empathy and to understand best were found asleep. Said Jesus, "Couldest not thou watch one hour?" (Mark 14:37).<br><br>These are the kinds of questions that we might ask ourselves so that the Lord will not need to do so.<br><br>Careful and thoughtful questions both from us and to us are essential parts of life. How we frame those we ask and how we respond to those that come to us will in large measure determine the outcomes in our striving and progression to keep our "second estate" (Abraham 3:26), or, in other words, achieve happiness in this life and qualify for eternal life in the world to come. In Rudyard Kipling's "The Elephant's Child," we find this good advice:<br><br><i>I keep six honest serving men</i><br><i>(They taught me all I knew);</i><br><i>Their names are What and Why and When</i><br><i>And How and Where and Who.</i><br>[<i>The Just-So Stories</i>(1902)]<br><br>With our unique perspective about the best source of answers to our most important questions, let us remind ourselves of the counsel of John:<br><br><i>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</i><br><br><i>And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</i>[1 John 5:14–15]<br><br>May we be thoughtful and wise in framing the questions we ask and, as we ask, always express appropriate gratitude for the privilege of not only asking questions both great and small but also receiving necessary and wonderful answers from Him who knows all that we really need to know. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>r Side of Heaven - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Elder Groberg:</b>My dear brothers and sisters, we are happy to be here. Jean and I met at BYU in 1952 on a blind date arranged by our sisters, who played violins together in the BYU Symphony. It was the first date for either of us at BYU. Since Jean was from California and I was from Idaho, how grateful do you think we are for BYU? Five years later we were married in the Los Angeles Temple. Those were five exciting, frustrating, trial-ridden years--but we knew what was right, and, despite serious challenges, things worked out, as they always do with the Lord's help. We loved one another then, and now--49 years, 11 children, and 33 grandchildren later--we love each other more than ever. Joy comes from true love. This joy is available to everyone if they will just follow these three simple steps:<br><br>1. Learn the truth.<br><br>2. Promise to live the truth.<br><br>3. Live the truth and trust the Lord that when you have done all you can, He will come to your rescue.<br><br>Love is largely an eternal commitment to think of and help someone else--especially a wife or husband or child--more than yourself. If we keep helping others regardless of their reciprocation, our soul keeps expanding, and eventually we can become like unto God, helping others with no limits.<br><br>To me the opposite of love is not hate but selfishness, or indifference. Selfishness shrivels the soul. Constantly thinking of and protecting ourselves causes us to become smaller. If we persist in this, we eventually shrink down to practically nothing.<br><br>A good sign of how truly we love someone is how anxiously we help them--even at the expense of our own convenience.<br><br>The truest love of all is the Savior's love and God's love for us. Think of the Savior's commitment to suffer for us and even to lay down His life for us, despite the almost total lack of appreciation of those around Him at the time.<br><br>What others do to us is almost incidental. The eternal principle of growth through true love--by helping others--lies within each one of us. And when this true love lies within both husband and wife, we can literally experience heaven on earth. I hope you all experience that! I love the Lord, I love my wife, I love my family, I love BYU, and I love all of you.<br><br>Again, the pattern for growth and joy in this life is:<br><br>1. Learn the truth--know what is right.<br><br>2. Promise, or commit, to live the truth.<br><br>3. Keep that promise, no matter what trials may come, by trusting the Lord to help you. I promise He will!<br><br>The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Having faith in Him means to trust Him. We must trust that what He tells us--through the scriptures, through prayer, through inspired teachers, through good leaders and parents--is right. Trust that He will help us keep our promises by making up the difference when we have done all we can. I personally know He will.<br><br>Here are some examples that apply to you particularly:<br><h2><em><strong>Code of Honor</strong></em></h2><br>When you come to BYU you are given a code of honor.<br><br>1. Study it, pray about it--learn that it is right.<br><br>2. Make a promise to keep it.<br><br>3. Keep it. The Lord will help you do so, and you will grow.<br><h2><strong><i>Missions</i></strong></h2><br>1. Gain a testimony that you should serve a mission. I am talking particularly, but not exclusively, to the young men.<br><br>2. Promise yourself and the Lord that you will serve.<br><br>3. Then serve. Serve the Lord with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. I promise you the Lord will help you. Both you young men and women must help one another stay worthy and focused on this goal.<br><h2><strong><i>Temple Marriage</i></strong></h2><br>1. Gain a testimony that marrying in the temple is what the Lord wants you to do.<br><br>2. Make a promise that you will do everything in your power to make this happen. Always live worthy and trust the Lord fully that that desire will be fulfilled in His own time.<br><br>3. Then get married to the right person at the right time and in the right place. Once you know it is right, don't delay unreasonably. The Lord will help you. To those already married, continue to keep those eternal promises with the Lord as a partner.<br><h2><strong><i>School</i></strong></h2><br>1. Decide on an area you can do well in.<br><br>2. Promise to do your best.<br><br>3. Do your best, and again the Lord will help you.<br><br>This is the law of eternal progression. There are many other examples.<br><br>Recently the movie<i>The Other Side of Heaven</i>was produced. The person who had the vision is a former BYU graduate, Mitch Davis. Three years ago he approached Bookcraft to purchase the movie rights of the book<i>In the Eye of the Storm,</i>which I had written several years before (at the request of a Church leader whom I greatly respect). Bookcraft said they were willing to sell those rights but felt Mitch should first talk to me. Of course I was very surprised.<br><br>Jean and I were very uncomfortable with the possibility of having our lives on "the silver screen." It may be some people's dream, but it definitely was not ours.<br><br>Let me state clearly that I do not feel my mission was any more special or purposeful than any other person's mission. Everyone's mission and marriage is special to them because it is theirs. And if they put their whole heart and soul into it, God will make it eternally meaningful.<br><br>When Jean and I met Mitch we were impressed with his integrity and his credentials and those of the Hollywood team he had assembled. I talked to my Church leaders, and they said if Mitch and his team promised to remain true to the spirit of the book, they would raise no objection.<br><br>Mitch made that promise and purchased the movie rights. He and his team then began the difficult task of raising money (there is no Church money involved; it is a private venture), adapting the book to the screen, selecting actors, shooting on location, editing, getting the music, and on and on. Despite many challenges, they persevered and did it.<br><br>Think again of the three steps.<br><br>1. They had a confirmation that it was right to make a movie from this book.<br><br>2. They made a promise to keep the movie true to the spirit of the book.<br><br>3. They did it. There were many trials, but with the Lord's help they did it.<br><br>At this time we will view the theater preview, after which Mitch Davis will take a few minutes.<br><br><i>[A film clip was shown here.]</i><br><br><b>Mitch Davis:</b>It is so good to be here with my lovely bride, who I also met and courted on this hallowed campus.<br><br>Several years ago I had a very dramatic experience regarding trusting the Lord. I was backpacking with my 10-year-old son, two of his friends, and our faithful dog, Pluto, when we were hit by lightning.<br><br>We were hiking above timberline when a sudden storm blew in. We pitched our tent, and I put the boys inside their sleeping bags to keep them warm. I started fixing dinner on our little camp stove. Then, suddenly, I was gone.<br><br>Although I have no recollection of the lightning hitting me, the boys tell me that it blasted through our tent's roof and hit me square in the chest and that I flew backward and landed on the floor unconscious with my eyes open but rolled back into my head.<br><br>The bulk of the strike passed through my chest and into the dog sitting behind me, killing him. The rest of the lightning curled down my right arm and struck the boy seated next to me, then danced wickedly about the tent, burning holes in sleeping bags and striking the two other boys.<br><br>But I knew nothing about this. In my mind, at least, I ceased to exist.<br><br>After some time I became aware of myself again. I began to be able to hear, although I could not see or move any part of my body. As if from a great distance I could hear the three boys screaming. I heard my son cry out, "Dad, please don't die!" One of the boys leaned over and gave me a single puff of artificial respiration. The other promised God he would never do another bad thing in his entire life if Brother Davis would just wake up.<br><br>But I couldn't wake up. I could only lie there, helpless, wondering what in the world had happened to me.<br><br>Then I became aware of something else--a dark presence I can only describe as impending death. I felt myself starting to leave mortality and realized my only hope was divine intervention. I fought with every fiber of my being to call on Heavenly Father.<br><br>Then a most interesting thing happened. Before I could call on Father, He called on me. Through the unmistakably clear voice of the Spirit, He encouraged me with these simple words: "You served a valiant mission. Ask in confidence."<br><br>Heavenly Father knew I needed extra faith at that moment. He knew I had faith in Him but lacked faith in myself as a worthy recipient of the miracle I so desperately needed. So he sent me that encouraging message: "You served a valiant mission. Ask in confidence."<br><br>I exerted every ounce of faith I had in a fervent, frenzied prayer. Heavenly Father responded by immediately freeing me from death's grip. I regained consciousness and the strength, several hours later, to hike off the mountain with my boy, his friends, and the body of our dog.<br><br>I do not tell you this story for the sake of mere drama, nor to boast about my personal missionary prowess. I assure you I was no more valiant than most missionaries. I tell you this story because of the significance of the Lord's choice of words to me: When my life literally hung in the balance, all that mattered were my two years of obscure service in the villages of Argentina.<br><br>How grateful I was I had decided to go on a mission and that I had worked hard once I got there! I remembered the words of my great BYU stake president, Robert K. Thomas: "If you're almost worthy, almost willing to make the sacrifice, you'll almost get the blessing." I wondered what the Lord would have said to me on that mountain had I<i>almost</i>decided to serve a mission.<br><br>I am so grateful the Lord Jesus Christ didn't "almost" atone for our sins. I am grateful Elder John Groberg didn't "almost" serve a valiant mission, and I know that he is grateful that Jean didn't "almost" wait for him.<br><br>Today, especially, I am grateful for you: the blessed, beloved students of this, "the Lord's university." You each have your own missions--past, present, and future. May you fulfill them valiantly, faithfully, fearlessly.<br><br>And during the dark times, may you hear the voice of the Lord whispering encouragement to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Elder Groberg:</b>We will now see a brief clip from the movie. It is from a situation that took place after I had been out on my mission a little over a year.<br><br>After the clip we will be honored to hear from my wife, Jean. She will explain some of her feelings and tell how she came to send me a picture of herself that helped me avoid some potentially dangerous pitfalls. Notice again the three steps: Knowing, promising, and doing.<br><br><i>[A film clip was shown here.]</i><br><br><b>Sister Groberg:</b>What wonderful memories I have of BYU. I loved everything about it: my classes, my roommates and dorm life, my involvement in the Church and school activities. John mentioned our first date. It was to the campus branch Priesthood Ball. We enjoyed devotionals in the Smith Fieldhouse, concerts, forums, talking, and walking down Campus Hill to an old swing. There are great times to be had without spending money! We both dated other people, but the more we got acquainted with others, the more we were drawn to each other.<br><br>When John left on his mission, we agreed to write. So for three years I wrote "Dear John" letters while continuing a busy life that included studying, dating, graduating, then going on to teach school.<br><br>To help tell the story in the film, Mitch adeptly used letters exchanged between Box 58, Nuku'alofa, Tonga, and Apartment 109, Richards Hall, Provo, Utah. The letters shown in the film are authentic--I loaned some to Mitch. We saved them all these years because they played such a significant role in our lives.<br><br>Often a letter John had written months earlier would arrive at just the right time, sharing an experience or some counsel that helped solve a concern I had right then. I began measuring myself and others to the mark of what I could tell John was becoming, and I knew I wanted to be available when he returned. The Lord blessed us both to be patient and always added extra help.<br><br>During fall quarter of my senior year, I tried to think of something appropriate to send John for Christmas. I didn't want to distract him from his missionary work, but I wanted to send something. My helpful roommates encouraged me to send a photo of myself. "Too presumptuous," I thought, as he had never asked for a picture nor given me one of himself. My roommates persisted, and since I couldn't think of anything else I could afford to mail, I sent him one. Never did I suspect it, but at the same time he sent a picture of himself to me! These two photos crossed in the mail, and both did great amounts of good on the other end.<br><br>Was it coincidence that my picture arrived in Tonga just in time to provide John a tangible form with which to reason with an otherwise unreasonable mother? I don't believe so. And all the letters I received at just the right time saying just the right thing, were they coincidence? I don't believe so.<br><br>When we strive to learn the Lord's will, promise to follow it, then do our very best, the Lord will work with us where we are to help us get where we should be. He uses daily events and people in our lives to give us opportunities to keep our promises to Him. As we do all we can, He directs events and magnifies our humble efforts until His purposes and promises are realized--both in our lives and in the lives of those we touch. That is how we experience true joy.<br><br>I testify that our loving Father in Heaven knows and loves us individually. He sent us here at the right time and place to learn and grow and serve to our fullest potential. I know that Jesus Christ's all-encompassing love for His Father and for each of us, as expressed in His infinite Atonement, has made it possible for us to return to Their presence. I pray that we might do so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Elder Groberg:</b>This next clip is about the faith of a Tongan branch president. The only way to get from island to island was by sailboat, so we sailed a lot. Two things sailors fear at sea are (1) being becalmed, and (2) being caught in severe storms. Being becalmed is when the wind ceases to blow and you just sit in the middle of the ocean going nowhere. We were on our way to teach a family on a small island when we were becalmed. See if you can sense how the branch president followed the three steps of eternal progress, including repentance.<br><br><i>[A film clip was shown here.]</i><br><br>We will now view the final clip, which is about the other fear sailors have: severe storms at sea. We had finished a successful circuit of preaching on several islands and were sailing home when we were hit by a fierce, albeit brief, tropical squall. Notice the symbolism in Jean's reaching out to save me. Many a man caught in the violent storms of life is saved by a faithful woman.<br><br><i>[A film clip was shown here.]</i><br><br>I remember thinking, when I was flipped out of the boat: This shouldn't be happening. I'm a missionary. Where's my protection? Missionaries aren't supposed to swim! It didn't take me long to realize that I had better quit complaining and start swimming. Eventually I made it to shore. In life, when "unfair" things happen to us, we shouldn't use energy complaining but use it "swimming." When things go against us, if we row or swim with all our might, the Lord will bless us, and we'll make it to shore.<br><br>Having experienced lives and elements in chaos, I appreciate more than ever the power and goodness of God in bringing order out of chaos in organizing the earth; dividing light from dark, land from ocean; and bringing plant, animal, and finally human life to this earth. Let us follow Him: Learn the truth, make promises to live the truth, and do all in our power to keep those promises. Sometimes we will feel becalmed, with our lives drifting aimlessly. Other times we will feel we are in the midst of major storms. But if we try our hardest, I promise that God--through the power of His love that connects heaven and earth--will help us, guide us, bless us, protect us, and, despite harrowing times, bring us safely to shore--safely back home.<br><br>Has He not promised, "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10)?<br><br>I know God our Heavenly Father lives. We are His children--His greatest creation. I know that Jesus Christ is the literal Son of God--that He lives and loves and forgives and helps and is close to each one of us. He is our Friend. I know that. I know He is my friend. I have a personal and sacred witness of that fact. I know He is your friend also. I know that each of you can obtain a personal witness of that fact--and, when you do, it will give you more strength and direction in your life than you can imagine. Seek it. Find it.<br><br>I know that God's plan is to help all of us progress and eventually receive a fullness of joy. He helps us learn the truth. He helps us make promises to obey those truths. He helps us keep those promises. When we do all we can and trust Him to do the rest, He will. I testify that there is a connection between heaven and earth. It is real. It applies to all people. It is available to you. I know it, and you can know it, too. God can and will reach down to you.<br><br>Jesus learned and believed in His Father's plan. He promised to do His part in fulfilling that plan--and through His overwhelming love for all of us, He fulfilled His part of that plan despite the unspeakable agony He was called on to bear. He was true and faithful to His promise. He knows what it is like to cry out for help. He hears our cries. I know He fulfilled His preparations unto the children of men through His atoning sacrifice. I know He lives. I know His love, His power, His friendship, His help. I know this is His Church and that Gordon B. Hinckley is His mouthpiece on the earth today. I leave my love and blessings with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John H.
