What a sight! I am grateful, my brothers and sisters, to have this opportunity once more to return to this great campus, to feel--as I always do--the spirit of this student body and of this great faculty. I compliment you on choosing Brigham Young University and pray for your continued success as you catch the vision of the purpose of this great institution.<br><br>I said to one student as I came in, "At least you can't be more than a week behind."<br><br>I am impressed with the size of this audience and with the facility and would like to compliment you on the general mechanics of moving into this great center. This is one of the few times in the history of my Church experience I have been able to park without being flagged or ticketed.<br><br>I thought of an experience that one of our senior brethren had at the Church parking lot. We have the same kinds of problems there that you do here. This good brother who has been around for quite a few years drove into the parking lot one morning. There was a fellow attending the gate who did not recognize the General Authority when he drove past. Using a very authoritative voice, he shouted, "Hey! Are you supposed to be in here?" The senior brother rolled down the window and said, "You know, I've been wondering that for thirty years myself." I thought about that as I came this morning.<br><br>One other experience comes to mind. There are certain challenges as well as some humor that go with sometimes not being recognized. The other day I went over to a department at the Church headquarters where I had been many times, and a fellow at the desk thought he recognized me. He said, "Good morning, Elder Packer."<br><br>I said, "Well, thank you very much for the compliment, but I'm not Elder Packer."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "I'm sorry, Elder Hanks. I didn't recognize you."<br><br>I can't resist one other. Once in a great while a General Authority gets a Sunday without a stake conference assignment. I had one several years ago. I decided to attend my own ward. That's a rare and interesting experience. In the time since I had last attended, our ward had been divided. We had a new member in the bishopric that I didn't know, and it became obvious, as I approached the door, that he didn't know me. As I walked in, he said, "Good morning! I'm Brother ___________, and who are you?"<br><br>I said, "I'm Paul Dunn."<br><br>He said, "Oh! You're Jeanne Dunn's husband."<br><br>And I said, "Yes I am."<br><br>He said, "We're honored to have you at church this morning."<br><br>I said, "I'm honored to be here."<br><br>He said, "If you'll follow me, I'll take you to your class."<br><br>And he did. He took me into the Senior Aaronic class. The teacher there was equally gracious and wonderful, and he didn't know me either. He welcomed me with open arms. And, you know, it got to be kind of funny; because as he started to teach, the irony of it all was that the lesson he taught that morning I wrote. About four times during the session, I raised my hand and made a contribution. After the class the teacher said, "You know, for a guy that doesn't come to church very often, you sure are smart."<br><br>Well, I went up after class and said, "Sir, I just want to tell you something."<br><br>He said, "Please do."<br><br>I said, "I thought that was the finest lesson I've ever heard."<br><br>He called me up the following Tuesday and said, "Why didn't you tell me?"<br><br>"I was having too much fun," I responded, "and besides, you're a great fellowshipper. You were tremendous."<br><h2>Challenges</h2><br>I told the seniors here this summer that recently I was given an honor at my old high school. Coming back to BYU has reminded me of that experience. I was honored as the alumnus of the year from Hollywood High; and if you checked my transcripts you'd see why that's quite a miracle. The honor was not for academic or athletic achievement but for activities in religion. They were paying honor to me as a Latter-day Saint. What a compliment to be recognized as a Latter-day Saint.<br><br>It was a thrill to go back to the old campus and reminisce, as people my age do. I walked around the halls and out on the ball field. I couldn't help but visit one or two of the classrooms where I'd been a student. I actually found my desk in my first-period English class during my senior year. I found it--I'm embarrassed to tell you how. I had carved my name in the desk. Now, you don't do that sort of thing these days, but some of us did. In fact, I didn't realize how original I was because my name was on a tombstone very neatly carved. It said: "Here lies Paul Dunn, who died waiting for the bell to ring."<br><br>As things will happen, the teacher whose class this was attended the banquet where I was to receive the award. I couldn't resist telling a story about one of my experiences in her class. She was a very exacting and precise lady who dressed every bit the part of the old schoolmarm. She stood straight as a toothpick, had no shape, wore long, black dresses and a big bob in her hair at the back, and she used to carry a ruler around and was very adept at using it. Quite a motivator.<br><br>I was having a problem of being tardy to this class. One morning she kept me after class and said, "Young man, if you're tardy one more time, I'll see to it you're dropped from the varsity ball team." Now, that was one method to get through to me; so I took a vow with her that I'd be tardy no more, and for many days I did very well. Later one morning when I had only about five days to go until the end of the semester, I was running about two minutes behind. I was pedaling my bike as fast as I could down Hollywood Boulevard. I go on campus, parked and locked it, and ran across the quad and into the liberal arts building where my class was located. Just as I entered the building, the bell started to ring. The tardy bell lasted twelve seconds; that's the time I had to go the length of the hall. Standing at the end of the hall in the doorway of my room was my teacher. She had her hand on the doorknob, and I knew that the second the bell quit ringing she'd close it. I started to run. The building had highly polished tile floors. I had on a pair of leather shoes, and I wasn't getting much traction. I could see she was eager to close the door. I ran and finally got some traction. I could sense just before I got to the door that the bell was going to quit, so I drew up on all the prowess I had. I went into a hook slide. I actually slid the last twenty feet, thanks to the highly polished floors. I slid right by her under two desks; and I remember that as I passed her I looked up and hollered, "<i>Safe!</i>"<br><br>Speaking of schools, I have just come from Southern California, where I've had one of the most glorious spiritual experiences of my life. President Oaks mentioned that I did some undergraduate work a few years ago at Chapman College. During my stay there, I came under the influence of a great teacher. Thank God for great teachers--some who don't even belong to the Church, but particularly for those who do, who have an abiding faith and testimony.<br><br>Dr. Guy M. Davis, a recognized authority of the New Testament at Chapman and throughout the western United States, was my teacher. This was twenty-three years ago. We used to have a little fun in his class. He would kid with us. I'd challenge him.<br><br>I said on one occasion in private, "I believe that whether you're aware of it or not, you're a Mormon. You act and think like one. The day will come when you and I will testify to these truths, and I'll have the opportunity of witnessing your baptism." I have corresponded, visited, and worked with this man now twenty-three years; and we baptized him last Friday night. I haven't words or the ability to express my affection for this man or the great thrill that came on the occasion of his baptism.<br><br>One humorous incident comes to mind. Dr. Davis is an authority on the book of John. He wrote his dissertation at the University of Southern California School of Religion on the apostle. He's since made many contributions concerning this disciple and apostle of the Lord. I raised my hand in one class, because I'm rather bold and brash on such occasions, and I said, "Dr. Davis, you keep quoting John. That's wonderful, but you're using secondary sources who don't really know this apostle. Didn't you know that, according to his own words, he still lives and tarries upon the earth as a special witness of our Lord and Savior?"<br><br>"Good heavens," he said, "you mean the Mormons have got John too?"<br><br>I said, "They do. And while we don't know his exact whereabouts, he lives and is a special witness."<br><br>And he was really overwhelmed. Every time he'd see me after that he'd say, "What's John doing?"<br><br>Well, about this time we were preparing to dedicate the Los Angeles Temple. And I thought, "Well, my grade needs a little help, so I'll take the class out and all of the religion faculty and give them a special tour." So I made arrangements with the authorities at the temple, and we took the tour. They were thrilled with that great edifice, excited about the opportunities, and couldn't believe the beauty. They were very inquisitive as we walked through the building. They'd say, "What's that? What does this mean?" I had a wonderful chance to teach.<br><br>Finally, we got up into the area of the celestial room. These rooms are very beautiful in their appointment. The room was roped off so you couldn't enter, but we could see a couple of rooms where we do ordinance work and a staircase that went up to another floor. My friend pulled me aside and said, "Maybe I'm out of order, but where does that that staircase go?"<br><br>"Oh," I said, "you shouldn't have asked."<br><br>"Oh, my gosh," he said, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be out of order."<br><br>I said, "You weren't; and for you, I'll tell."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "would you?"<br><br>I said, "I will, if you promise you won't tell anybody else."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "I promise."<br><br>So I took him over by an isolated pillar, and I said, "Promise, now?"<br><br>He said, "I promise."<br><br>I said, "You see that staircase?"<br><br>"Uh-huh!"<br><br>I said, "There's a room at the top."<br><br>"Oh!"<br><br>And then I said, "That's where John lives!"<br><br>"Good heavens," he said.<br><br>We have John, and we now have Dr. Davis.<br><h2>Reminiscing</h2><br>It was mentioned that I had an opportunity to preside as a mission president in New England. I think New England is very special, inasmuch as it's the birthplace of our country and the birthplace of many of the great early leaders of this Church. Some forty plus early contributors to the faith found their homes in New England. Three that are very prominent, of course, are the Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and Oliver Cowdery. I was honored to be the caretaker--spiritually speaking--for a while, of that great area.<br><br>Occasionally even mission presidents need motivation; and in New England I used to go up to the birthplace of the Prophet on occasion to renew spiritual feelings and commitments. I used to get a lift historically as well. Occasionally I'd drive eleven miles from the mission headquarters out to old Concord, where the North Bridge is located. This is the location of the commencement of the Revolutionary War.<br><br>And as I would walk up and down the banks of the Concord River, reminiscing about our early heritage, I'd gain great strength. Eleven miles in the other direction is old Boston Harbor. Anchored to the moorings there is one of the great vessels of all time,<i>Old Ironsides</i>. I hope when you review your history, here or elsewhere, you don't just do it mechanically, but sense something of the divine and the historical in the lives of those who paid so much for what we have today. This great old ship, commonly known as the U.S.S.<i>Constitution,</i>did more, I suppose, than any other single vessel in preserving the freedom of this country. Over seventy times it went to sea with our enemies and won every battle. It's still commissioned as one of the great ships of the United States Navy. You can't stand beside that old vessel or walk upon its decks without being somewhat uplifted and touched.<br><h2>Workmanship</h2><br>As I told some of the seniors here in summer school, it reminded me of a few ships that Brother Adam Bennion used to talk about. I'd like to borrow from his theme and impress upon your minds the importance of anchoring some of these next to<i>Old Ironsides</i>. I would hope in your harbor you would put next to the U.S.S.<i>Constitution</i>that great vessel<i>workmanship</i>. I sit with my brethren on the Board of Trustees of this great institution, and your president and other officers and administrators of this school take great pride in the fact that you have come here to learn. We have placed at your disposal some of the greatest authorities in every field possible, and, more particularly, teachers who are committed to a divine cause.<br><br>If I have one concern as I travel the United States or, in fact, the world, it's in seeing sloppy workmen. I've just completed building a new home here in Mormon country. It's been quite a revelation. It's a frustrating, exciting experience. One of the things that I noted, because I'm supposed to be somewhat oriented in an educational line, is that there are very few workmen today who take pride in their work. I didn't take a poll as to how many of these people came and exercised or supplied their services on my behalf; but I suspect, just by my conversation, many belong to this faith. I was appalled at how many really didn't care about the quality of their work but were in it for the dollar or "how quick I can get out of here today," and service seemed to be a forgotten product. I would hope and pray, my fellow students, that you would learn to take pride in your work.<br><br>Sometimes homework becomes mechanical, and the seminar or the class seems almost too routine. I appreciate with you that most students have to sift and seek for those eternal golden kernels that build a philosophy of life. That's a part of the educational process, learning to sift.<br><br>I would hope that in these years of study and preparation you acquire here you would learn to be great workmen, a true craftsman. My, the world needs quality in service and performance. It seems to be a lost art. I hope you have come to learn the tools of your trade. It was James Truslow Adams who said, "There are obviously two kinds of education: one teaches you how to make a living (that's the academic side to a great extent), the other how to live." And that's why this is a great religious institution. I pray you'll take pride in your work. Don't worry about the clock; you work because the world needs your faith and your great talents.<br><h2>Friendship</h2><br>Second, in your fleet, I hope you would include that great vessel<i>friendship</i>. I notice, as I travel the world and, yes, even in the Church, there are a lot of lonely people. I just sense today, in this wonderful congregation, there are some lonely Latter-day Saints. I think we have enough scriptures in our standard works that indicate we ought to be concerned about our fellowmen. The Savior put it very well when he said, "Lose yourself in the service of others."<br><br>We have a tendency, because of our own insecurities, to become turned in, selfish, self-oriented. We're here in part to learn how to turn ourselves out, to lose ourselves and help somebody else, to relieve the frustrations of others. Mormons, if not careful, can become very cliquish. I would like to challenge this great student body to look out and befriend those who need a friend.<br><br>When we went back to Boston we took with us an eight-year-old daughter. Our other two were attending Brigham Young University, and we left them here. We went from a family of five to a family of three in one evening, never again to be brought together as a family because both of my older daughters married while we were on our missions. That's a great experience, but here now my little eight-year-old became an only child overnight--quite a frustration. And then, to top it off, we moved to a new area; and she was lonesome for her friends and her acquaintances at school.<br><br>We signed her up in the Russell School in Cambridge. The Russell School was built in 1888; and it is not a very imposing looking school, except to an archaeologist. It had lots of weeds in the yard, and a terribly musty smell greeted one as he entered the building. The floorboards buckled, and you got an eerie feeling as you walked the halls.<br><br>We tried to prepare this little girl for her first day at school just as soon as we arrived. Because it was a long way off, she didn't panic; but as the day drew closer her concern increased. We took her shopping for new school clothes, had a family evening organized around how to adjust and what to do and how to turn yourself out to adjust to the new environment. She could handle that all right, because it was still theory. And then the night before, we planned a special program around helping her for the special day. She retired to her bed all right but seemed quite restless.<br><br>The next few hours passed, and then she suddenly appeared at the door where I was studying. She was rubbing her stomach. She said, "Dad, I'm sick." Now, you know what kind of sickness she had, don't you? Not physical, not mental, but emotional. "Can't sleep, sir."<br><br>Well, I invited her over, put her on my lap, and we chatted for a moment. Then I put on some music that we liked to listen to together and rubbed her tummy. She finally drifted into never-never land and seemed pretty well under control. I took her body, with its dangling legs, upstairs and put her back to bed. I turned to go out, got as far as the door, and she said, "I'm still awake." I went back and lay down on the bed and stroked her head for a few moments, and she finally went to sleep.<br><br>The next morning while I was at breakfast she came down dressed only in her slip. She said, "Dad, I just thought you ought to know I don't think I'll go to school today."<br><br>I said, "Why not?"<br><br>She said, "I think I'm going to throw up."<br><br>Now, you know what she's trying to tell me, don't you? "I'm nervous. Will my teachers like me? Will I be accepted?" Oh, she was not capable of asking those kinds of questions, but these were the concerns of her heart. She was lonely; she didn't know how to fit in. She was concerned about making new friends.<br><br>And I said, "Well, you know the answer to that, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes, sir, I guess we're going."<br><br>I said, "How would you like your mother and me to drive you over?" She liked that, so we did.<br><br>We got in front of the school, and the tears started to well up. The warning bell sounded; I got her out of the car, and she grabbed hold of my leg like a tackle I hope we've got this year for BYU. I had to drag her, literally, to the door. The door opened, and now she clung to both legs. I shall never forget the expression on the face of that eight-year-old. She looked at me, and she said, "Dad, if you really love, if you really do, you won't send me in there."<br><br>I said, "Honey, this may sound like a strange philosophy: it's because I do love you that I am sending you in there."<br><br>We went in. The tears really came now, without shame. Then it happened. Then the little miracle. Around the corner came the only other Latter-day Saint in the whole student body. Thank God, another eight-year-old girl. And she had seen her a couple of times at some stake functions. And this little girl was an extrovert's extrovert. Even though only eight, she had learned to lose herself in the interest of others. She came around the corner, and she said, "Oh, Kellie! How are you? Gosh, it's good to see you! What's your home room number?" And Kellie told her. "Great! That's mine, too. Come on, I'll show you where."<br><br>And before Kellie knew it, she had let go, got about ten paces out in front of me; and then I'll never forget this lesson. She turned and said, "Oh, Dad, you can go now. I don't need you anymore."<br><br>Well, we need friends. And the Latter-day Saint people with their philosophy ought to be the friendliest in the world. We are, but we tend to sometimes get in little corners, and I'd like to challenge this great student body to extend this tremendous influence to the rest of the world.<br><h2>Courtship</h2><br>Hopefully, next to friendship you'll anchor the vessel<i>courtship</i>. This is a great area, and I haven't time to develop it this morning. But if I have one concern as your friend and so-called leader, it is that sometimes we think that just member marrying member guarantees eternal happiness and solves all problems. You don't have to look very far in our society to see that there's more to mate selection than just membership. I hope you are considering the intellectual, the spiritual, the emotional as well as the physical. And I wouldn't want to minimize the physical; it's important to look right, project yourself well. But those aren't the only things that build for eternal joy and happiness.<br><br>I pray that you young ladies in this great institution will go all the way in your education. Sometimes there's a problem when you drop out of school and become just a housewife. You want to take with you a spiritual and intellectual capability that will lift your husband and complement him in terms of what the gospel teaches. I appreciate that all education doesn't have to be formal. Of course it doesn't. The Prophet Joseph Smith and many others are excellent examples of self-educated persons. But the glory of God is intelligence, and intelligence he expects us to use in mate selection. As the years progress, you will learn that spirituality plays a much greater role in family togetherness and solidarity than you now realize. It's the spirit that gives depth and dimension.<br><h2>Hardship</h2><br>I hope next to that great ship<i>courtship</i>you have anchored the vessel<i>hardship</i>. Now, you wouldn't be worth much in this old world if you didn't have a hardship or two. Sometimes young people would just like to go through life without a challenge. It seems easier, but it isn't. The purpose of mortality is to learn to be like our Heavenly Father, and hardship is the refining tool that prepares us for that great and glorious day. We all have barriers, obstacles. There's not a person in this congregation who couldn't bring us all to tears with his ups and downs. I've noticed that no one is exempt. I think the purpose of life is to see how you handle it, not whether you get one or not.<br><br>I had 467 full-time missionaries given to me over a period of three years. What a glorious experience. I remember I hadn't been in New England more than an hour when the telephone rang. On the line was an elder I hadn't met yet, an elder who had been in the mission field just one week. He had some concerns, as sometimes missionaries do, and he wanted to go home. He didn't just say, "I want to go home." He announced he was going. He was a small young man in stature, quite good-looking, and a sharp athlete; but he was born with a handicap, and this was one of his barriers. He had only half a larynx. When he spoke he spoke with a harsh voice, and people often made fun of him. He announced on the phone, "President Dunn, I just called to tell you I'm going home tonight, so don't try to stop me."<br><br>I said, "Well, at least pay me the courtesy of coming over and getting acquainted and saying good-bye."<br><br>"All right, I'll come by on my way to the airport."<br><br>He came over. In the meantime, I checked his file and found among other things one thing in my favor--he wanted to be an athlete. He was a good one. He wanted to make a career out of sports. I sat him down. He said, "Now, President, you're not going to talk me into staying."<br><br>I said, "Didn't intend to. Tell me your problem."<br><br>He said, "It's very simple. I don't have a testimony. I don't believe in the Lord. Furthermore, and you'll learn sometime, my home life hasn't been what it ought to be. I hate my dad, I hate my mother, I hate this Church, I hate this mission, and I already hate you."<br><br>I thought, "Well, this is a thrilling challenge; first day on your mission and you've got a young man thinking like this." I said, "I don't know what all the circumstances are, but let me tell you something. The Lord lives, and he loves you. Your parents, for reasons you can't fully comprehend, love you. This Church loves you, this mission loves you, and I like you a little bit. Now," I said, "you can walk out of this mission anytime you want; but I don't think you're going to and let me tell you why. You're not a quitter. You may have a lot of hang-ups and problems, but you're not a quitter. I noticed from your athletic record that you don't quit. Let me tell you something you may not know. I played professional baseball for a number of years and found myself behind in early and middle innings of many a ball game. If you were my coach, and we were behind five to two in the seventh inning, and I came to you and said, 'Coach, let's get out of here while we can and save face,' what would you say?"<br><br>He said, "We've got two more innings to catch up and win."<br><br>I said, "Exactly, and a mission is no different!"<br><br>"Well," he said, "that's baseball."<br><br>I said, "No, it isn't. The game of life plays by the same rules and principles. I just don't think you're going to quit because you're not that kind of player. There's the door. You can go if you must, but I don't think you will."<br><br>"Well," he said, "I'll try it one more week."<br><br>"Fine. One more week. You call me next week, and we'll talk about it."<br><br>He called me the next week, and he gave me the same dialogue. He didn't even miss a line. He had it out again, and would you believe for the next 103 weeks. Every week, through the mail, in person, on the phone, "I'm going, President!"<br><br>"So long, Elder; but I don't think you are."<br><br>And then it happened, the 104th week. Another phone call and he said, "I've got to tell you. It happened. I got the spirit!" And he told me of some very special experiences he had had that week, how the Lord had answered his prayers and how he received a testimony. Through real hardship and prayers he got an answer.<br><br>The following Sunday he came into the mission home for his last evening prior to his departure home. We used to have a simple ceremony when a group departed; and when it came time for him to speak he said, "Can I say something, President?"<br><br>I said, "You haven't hesitated up to now. What do you want to tell us?"<br><br>He said, "You know what I found out this week? I've found what a testimony is. I believe in the Lord. He lives, and I love him. I love my mom and dad. I love this Church. I love this mission, and I kind of like you."<br><br>Well, that's great. Hardship. Don't apologize for it. Hit it head on. Just remember--I think I've taught this to you before--it was Bob Newhart who said, "Crises plus time equals humor." The greatest crises you face right now or will ever face, given a little time, will seem humorous under other circumstances. Remember the dates you didn't get in high school? Kind of a crisis, wasn't it? Sort of funny now. I asked a little girl at Hollywood High--it took me seven weeks to get the courage to ask her--to go to the show with me: "Will you go to the show with me?"<br><br>She said, "No."<br><br>Just about crushed me. That was a great crisis. I went home and felt terrible and thought, "I'm nothing." Now it's kind of funny. Crises plus time equals humor. Keep a sense of humor in your life. Be balanced.<br><h2>Worship</h2><br>Finally, I would say anchor next to the other great vessels<i>worship.</i>This is perhaps the greatest ship of all. Go home and read the 133rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the 39th verse. The Lord tells us why it's important. Worship. I haven't time to develop that to any extent. Let me just say this. God really lives. He's your Father. Christ, his son, our brother, stands at the head of this Church. I suppose most of what I have said won't be remembered by the time you get back to class, but the feeling that comes when one of us bears his testimony is perhaps the lingering effect, and that's why we take an hour out of a busy week to meet together.<br><br>Just last week the General Authorities met with the First Presidency in the upper room of the Temple. This was the first official meeting we have had with the new First Presidency of the Church. I've been a General Authority for eight and a half years. I have been in many meetings with President Harold B. Lee. Great and marvelous and magnificent as his faith and testimony are and were when he served as an apostle of the Lord, as I watched him very carefully and closely in this special room I saw for my own self the mantle of the Prophet. I testify to you young people that it is real. This was not the same Harold B. Lee. He has been called and ordained to be God's prophet today. God lives; Jesus is the Christ, and he works through his servants. To that I testify as I bear solemn witness to these things. I give you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<br>
Comparisons are not appropriate, and I make none, but that choir is certainly unexcelled.<br><br>I was kind of hoping I could say the same with reference to football, as I mention to you what I heard from Jerry Kramer, the professional football player. He was talking about the man glued to his television set, whose wife said, being able to bear it no more, "Henry, you love football more than you love me."<br><br>And he said, "Yes, but I love you better than I love basketball."<br><br>I should make an explanation to a couple of puzzled young men that I met on my way in here. Things are not always as they seem. For instance, I read from the Fayetteville, Arkansas,<i>Courier</i>the other day the interesting little news item that Thomas Brown, while fishing at Lee's Point some time ago, lost his gold wedding ring. Last week, while he was fishing again at Lee's Point and cleaning a fish he caught there, his knife struck something solid. It was his thumb.<br><br>The two young men who were on their way in here saw me getting into my car. I said, "You're too late, men; your watch must have stopped. It's over." They watched me as I drove out and then came to a closer parking spot, because I have, unfortunately to depart these premises immediately after this assembly is through, and we'll have to forbear shaking hands, which I like to do more than speak to you. I'm going, I should say--almost nothing else would be important enough--to keep an appointment with that one son President Oaks mentioned. He and I for a long time have had a date at noon today, and so I must go and be there.<br><br>I had a recent experience with Richard that was important. He was ordained a deacon by his father a few weeks ago. His mother and I were privileged to go to the Sunday morning priesthood session, the general session, where he was presented to the brethren. He walked steadily to the front, this fine-looking, fine young man, and stood by the bishop as his name was presented for receiving the Aaronic Priesthood and ordination to the office of deacon. We had a chance to vote. Later, as he reported this incident to his sisters, who were not at the meeting, he said, "I was kind of frightened walking up that aisle all alone and standing up there by the bishop, until I looked down and saw Dad's hand higher than all the rest." And he's right. It was as high as I could put it. And in all earnestness and sincerity, that's how high I'd put it for you, because I think you and what you can do are of great and grave importance. Not what you will do, necessarily--what you can do.<br><h2><b>Thank God for Life</b></h2><br>I had the great experience this morning of driving down Provo Canyon after a few hours yesterday of hard physical labor, and of enjoyment of the beauty of that place. I thought of many things, including one story I must share with you, which suffused my soul. I saw a picture of a young man on a weekly newspaper magazine a while ago. He had long hair, a typical mod outfit. He was standing by a motorbike, and I suppose some might have indulged the thought that here's one of them, or another one. I read the article, it's a story of a young man, twenty, who has leukemia and has had it for years. Every Monday morning he drives twenty miles or more on that motorbike to a great medical center, where for two and a half or three or more hours they subject him to the medication and the treatment which have prolonged his life beyond expectation. It's such a traumatic, terrible shock to his emotional and physical self that, as he rides those twenty miles back on his motorbike, he understands that for several days--two, maybe three--he's going to be so ill that he can hardly bear it. During those days he repeatedly assures himself that he will never make that trip again. It isn't worth it. And then he has a day or two, or maybe three, to sit across the table from his mom, and to work with his dad a little bit in his construction business, and to ride his motorbike and look at the sky and the trees and the beauty of this world. He said a very vital thing: he said, "It seems to me that I'm kind of sitting on a plateau overlooking the rest of humankind, watching them assail each other in hostility over a missed appointment, or an improper word, or an unkind thought, while I sit there thanking God for one more day to be alive."<br><br>I pray the Lord to bless you and me with sense enough to be appreciative of that wonderful blessing.<br><h2><b>Bob Allen</b></h2><br>At midnight I had a well-prepared--whether appropriate or not--talk to present to you, and then the idea came that I worked on just a few minutes this morning and which appeals to me as the one I must express to you. A few weeks ago in Salt Lake City a twenty-six-year-old man was buried. He had fallen off a mountain peak while climbing. He was an expert climber, but there was an accident and he was killed. He was going to enter medical school the next week; he's a graduate of a great university in the West. He and his sister are the only members of the Church in their wonderful family, and he's special.<br><br>What I have to say today is not in eulogy or memoriam of Bob Allen but is inspired by a remark passed on to me by the mother of a lovely young lady who, in a family home evening when the members of the family were invited by a wise father to tell what they had learned this summer, referred to Bob Allen's funeral as one of the most marvelous experiences of her whole life. Sad as it was to lose this kind of a young man, excellent in every way, she said, it was a day of rejoicing and uplift--a sublime day. She said--and she was so sincere--"I wonder what they would say about me."<br><br>They who spoke at the funeral were the former bishop of this young man, now a president of a university, and Bob's roommate over many years--his dear friend for more than eight years in school, on missions, where they corresponded, and back in school and through graduation. The bishop is a marvelous man of great spiritual depth. His sermon couldn't be excelled. The young man was unsure and heartsick. He said he'd been laughing and crying all week long intermittently, as he read the letters from Bob, and as he thought over what this young man had meant to him. He gave an estimate of Bob Allen's effects on him and others. Today I'd like to talk about the four gifts he said Bob gave him, and invite you seriously to consider the value and virtue of a life when it can give such gifts.<br><h2><b>Service</b></h2><br>Bob, he said, gave him the great blessing of seeing one who really served. For Bob believed in service. He believed in sharing, and that was the word that seemed to get the emphasis, the sharing that had characterized this young man as he reached out to so many others in so many ways. He mentioned the little car Bob had owned. He said, "We spoke of it as 'our car,' because that's how he made it to me. I tried not to take advantage of that." Because he was so gracious, he shared--he shared his time, his talent, his concern.<br><br>I sat thinking my own thoughts on the stand that day, and I've thought them since, and I've had a great blessing this morning thinking about what Bob did and what each of us can do. God loves every one of his children--of that we are absolutely assured, and we know it in our hearts--but God needs an instrument of his love. He needs those who can take his love and make it meaningful and personal in the lives of others.<br><br>I think with delight of a great story I learned as a boy and came across again last week, almost afresh, after years of intermittently referring to it. It's the story of Gideon--Gideon, who faced armies described as like grasshoppers, with camels as numerous as the stars in the heavens; Gideon, who had a big army, but some of them were excused, then others were sent home, and then, with three hundred, he undertook the job of facing the Midianites. Do you remember how he divided his three hundred into three groups? He taught them what to do because he was creative and God was helping him. Each had a lamp in a pitcher, and a trumpet, and at that critical moment, as the watch had just changed, Gideon gave the signal. They broke the pitchers, the lights showed, the trumpets sounded, and the great war cry went out: "The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon!" (Judges 7:18). The enemy was routed in confusion, slaughtering each other.<br><br>That's a great, marvelous theme: the sword of the Lord and of Gideon.<br><br>I was in Nha Trang once, in a meeting where the sword of the Lord and Gideon was talked about by some of our troops who were doing marvelous work, sharing and teaching and giving beautiful representation to the principles they believe in. And then I went up to a place called Da Nang and met with another group of troops that same day. A man stood in marine major uniform--he'd been a bishop; he's been one since. It isn't he as it is not Bob Allen that I particularly praise today, though I have great love and respect in my heart for them and many others. What I praise is a principle, a principle application to every one of us. He stood, this man, and told humbly how he felt about being where he was, in the miserable business in which he was engaged, bore his witness, sat down, and was followed by other young men, one of whom said something the midst of a simple, beautiful testimony that keeps ringing in my ear. He was nineteen years old, a stalwart, wonderful young man. He looked down at the major in the marine uniform who'd spoken before and he said, "Thank God for Major Elliott. Since I met him, I've been trying to keep my life clean and sweet. And I can look you in the eye and tell you that my life will stand inspection."<br><br>The sword of the Lord and of Gideon. To share our energies, our gifts, our skills, our faith, our love, dependent as we do it upon Almighty God, whose arm we are, whose tongue we are, when we, with authority, represent him; whose hand we are as we perform the work of his ministry. To share and serve.<br><h2><b>Discipline</b></h2><br>The second point was discipline. The speaker at the funeral told about Bob's discipline--physically and in terms of cultural, educational, and Church activity and attainment. They used to go over to the football stadium, he said, at 4:00 everyday, because Bob loved being fit. They'd run up and down the stairs until they were so exhausted they couldn't do it anymore, and then Bob would say, "Let's try a few windsprints." He had a little motto: When things get tough, fight back.<br><br>Well, I've been thinking about discipline. I read the words of Mahatma Gandhi again the other day. (We stood at his tomb in India not many years ago and thought our thankful thoughts.) "Even for life itself," he wrote, "we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me: to die, but never to break my pledge. How can I control others, if I cannot control myself?"<br><br>There are many forms of discipline, many expressions and applications. Some of us are waiting until we graduate to begin to care about other people, until we get the degree to begin to live. Some of us even wait until morning, or until it's warmer, to pray. Discipline suggests a course and a determined effort to keep to that course.<br><br>Sometimes discipline is great courage. Years ago I cut from the newspaper and saved a statement from Charles Edison, governor of New Jersey, about his father, who on December 9, 1914, was all but wiped out by a roaring inferno that destroyed the building where his life's labor were stored, including the old red brick laboratory in which his current and future inventive efforts were concentrated. Damage exceeded two million dollars, insurance coverage not a tithe of it. Charles, then a young man, stood watching this inflammable material explode, the freight cars burn, the lifework of his dad go up in smoke, and then turned to see his father, sixty-seven years old, standing by the laboratory doorway, disheveled by the strenuous exertion of helping to fight the fire, his white hair tossed by the December wind. Thomas Edison turned to his son. "'Where's Mom?' he wanted to know. I couldn't tell him. 'Go find her. Tell her to get her friends down here right away. They'll never see anything like this again as long as they live.'" Charles Edison said, "On that grim December night I was 24. My father was 67." Before the ashes were cold, Thomas Edison turned to his discouraged associates with these words: "You can always make capital out of disaster. Now we are rid of our past mistakes. Let's go to work."<br><br>The discipline that comes close to all of us may be expressed by something appearing in the newspaper the other day about Gary Player, this great golfer from overseas. He lost a tournament by failing to sign the scorecard, which is automatic disqualification. When he violated the rule, he was asked if someone in the scoring tent couldn't have reminded him to sign the card. Listen to what Gary Player said--it cost him that day the winner's prize, which was much more than the runner-up. "My friend," Player replied, "there are responsibilities in life. You cannot shove your responsibilities on the shoulders of someone else. It was my responsibility to sign the card. I failed to meet it; so I must suffer the consequences." There is so much to say about discipline--that measure of self-control, that quality of character--that knowing a way moves us to follow that way, to keep the rules.<br><h2><b>Excellence</b></h2><br>The third point of that wonderful young man in the sermon was to comment on Bob's excellence. He mentioned the piano which Bob played so well, and that he went over every morning to the institute to practice the piano because he was going into medical school and felt he wouldn't have enough time to keep really sharp, and he wanted to be good. One of his friends played some magnificent Brahms that day on the piano, and the young man who spoke said, "I wouldn't have known Brahms from anybody else till I lived with Bob. But while we spent some time listening to rock, which he did with good nature, he also taught me to love Brahms and the other greats, and he would explain to me the different ways in which Brahms could be played. He helped me to want to be what he was."<br><br>Well, excellence can mean many things. There can be excellence of performance, creatively. I heard the story once--and love to repeat it--of the two thousand Pennsylvania high school seniors gathered at the University of Pittsburgh to be feted for their excellence. There had been many speakers, many programs, banquets, and they were jaded a bit with it all. That last day, though, their speaker was a man who, when he was introduced as one of those chiefly responsible for the development of the Salk polio vaccine, stood and snapped the braces which reached past his waist, took the two hand crutches, and laboriously made his way to the podium. Seeing their faces, sensing what had happened, and, with great wisdom and inspiration, I think, he said, "We didn't perfect the vaccine in time to save some of us. Thank God we developed it in time to save you. What will you do for the next generation?" And then he made his way laboriously back to his chair.<br><br>Well, excellence can be in behavior, manners, courtesy; and that's available to anyone. Prime Minister Nehru, in his last public utterance, said: "People have become more brutal in thought, speech, and action. The process of coarsening is going on apace all over the world. We are becoming coarsened and vulgarized because of many things." And then he made a plea to stop the process of vulgarization. There can be excellence of character, of choice, of quality of our life-style. There can be excellence of manners and of courtesy. And then I thought, as perhaps some of you have, of the two statements made in these two books about a more excellent way, one by Paul the apostle, as he finished the story comparing the Church to the body of a man and then emphasized for us all that each member is of vital importance and that the head can't say to the foot or to the eye to the hand, "I have no need of thee." There can be excellence in home teaching, excellence in teaching in a classroom. Do you remember how he used the words? Let me read to you from Ether, the twelfth chapter, how Moroni referred to the more excellent way. It's in this chapter that he reaches into the past for illustrations of great faith.<br><br><i>Wherefore by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled.</i>[Ether 12:11]<br><br>The gift of his Son made available the more excellent way, and in that all of us cannot only be accommodated but can achieve.<br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>So much more of importance to say. Let me make the last point made by the young man, emphasized and testified to, and it may be one you'd expect to hear. He said, "Bob Allen gave me the gift of love. He taught me what it means to love. He loved his family; he loved them in a way I had not understood. We had a landlady," this boy said, "who was more than ninety years old and who, in the natural course of events, didn't get much attention from the energetic young students rushing back and forth. But one night, not long before his death," he said, "Bob spent three hours, three hours he had much use for, sitting down in the living room, listening to her tell the story of her own son, who'd been named Bob, and of her life."<br><br>Bob became a volunteer worker with the foreign students on his campus. He loved people, and many times, said his young friend, he would say, "I think I'd better go see Kioshi or Kevin, or someone else. I think maybe they need to talk." He'd come back much later and tell of a pleasant visit.<br><br>Do you recall a scene from Ecuador in the newspaper which related to the Bible several years ago? A group of Christian Missionary Alliance workers in Ecuador were killed by the Indian tribe they were helping to learn Christianity. The people never had a chance to learn, and their alphabet was obscure. These young missionaries were learning the alphabet and trying to teach them when they were all killed. They were marched away to die, and they went singing a wonderful old Protestant hymn, its text taken from the book of 2 Chronicles: "We rest on thee, and in thy name we go" (2 Chronicles 14:11). Their wives and families are back in Ecuador now, teaching that tribe.<br><br>A week ago Sunday, in the stake conference I was attending, a young man was called to the pulpit without notice--he had had a few minutes only that morning. I wish there were a way, somehow, to pass on to you what he said and how he said it. I can try. He said he'd been away to school and came home to find a very dear friend, a beautiful young lady with whom he'd had a long acquaintance and a very respectful one, now way out from where she had been before. She'd started on the drug habit and had become so dissolute and tragically destroyed a figure that he couldn't believe it. He said he went home--and this is a young man with two college degrees, on his way to a third--he went home that night and got on his knees and began to talk to the Lord. He said it was as if he had had, for the first time in his whole life, his own private revelation on prayer. "I cried out to the Lord for her," he said. "I didn't just say words. I wept. My whole heart was concerned for her. I cried to God for help. I wanted his strength in helping me to help her. And while I prayed," he said, "I came to a consciousness I have never before enjoyed. My concern for her was intense and all-consuming and very sincere. And I knew, as I prayed, that the concern of Almighty God for me was just that kind, but of godly quality." He talked about his own life, which had not always been exemplary, and he finished, as I'd like to today, with reference to a revelation given to Joseph Smith at a time of terrible trial, unbelievable trial for him.<br><br>You remember he was young and vigorous. He had had magnificent experiences. He had, in vision, enjoyed the ministrations of angels; in his own lifetime he had seen and conversed with Almighty God and his holy Son. He had a great people, a great mission, and he found himself incarcerated in a filthy dungeon, not fit for animals. In section 121, in those first marvelous words, he cried out to the Lord in understandable anguish, "O God, where art thou?" He was answered. In section 122 is part of that answer. I'll say nothing after I read these words. Listen to them carefully, please.<br><br><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land of by sea;</i><br><br><i>If thou art accused with all manners of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i><br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for they good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:5–8]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marion D. Hanks was an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 September 1972.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
I feel greatly honored, brothers and sisters, in the invitation to speak to you here today. As I came into the building, I said to Brother Peterson, "It scares you just to look at the building." Then to think that you have to talk to all these wonderful young people. We're so proud of this university--your president, the faculty, and you young people that help to make it what it is; and of course the campus is wonderful, but that isn't what really counts. As far as the Church is concerned, you know we could get our academic training through our taxes without having to maintain this institution, but what it is doing here--implanting in the hearts of the youth of this great Church a desire to make something of themselves, a desire to help build the kingdom of God in the earth, preparing you for happy homes and for marriages in the temple--that justifies all the money that we are spending to help maintain this institution. We have four grandchildren enrolled here at present and one great-granddaughter. We have had five grandsons graduate from here, and they have all been on their missions, and they are all doing a great work in the Church, and if it can do that for all of the young men who come here, then we are getting good dividends on all that the Church is spending to maintain this institution.<br><h2><b>Be Ready to Give a Reason</b></h2><br>Now, those of us who have been raised in Mormon communities sometimes just take our membership in the Church for granted, and we don't really put forth an effort to understand fully what privileges are ours to be members of this great Church. We find some illustrations of this as we go through the Church in our ministry. For instance, some years ago Sister Williams, who was then a member of the presidency of that young women's organization of the entire Church--and at that time she was the editor of the question-answer page in the<i>Deseret News--</i>told me this story:<br><br>She said that one of our Mormon girls married and went east, and when her neighbors found that she was a Mormon they all wanted to know what the Mormons believed. So she wrote to Sister Williams, and she said, "Please write and tell me what we believe. I know the first two principles are that you shouldn't use tea or coffee or play cards." Now can you imagine anybody getting much of a thrill out of membership in the Church if that's all that he knows about it?<br><br>I like the words of Peter. He said, "Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of hope that is in you with meekness and fear" (1 Pet. 3:15). And then you remember he said to the Church of his day, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people." Why? "That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Pet. 2:9). Now, not only can we show forth his praises by the lives that we live, but also, in the words of the apostle Peter, we ought to be able to give a reason why we are members of the Church.<br><br>I went on my first mission to the little land of Holland. My cousin went with me. (He was the son of one of the General Authorities. If I were to tell you his name, I presume most of you older folks would know him." He was sent up to Norway, into the land of the midnight sun, and I was sent to Holland. He had been raised in a sheltered home. One day he wrote me a letter, and calling me by my name he said: "LeGrand, I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I ever dreamed of. And I told him that if he had something better than I had, I would join his church."<br><br>I wrote him back, and calling him by name I said, "You told him just the right thing. If he has something better than you have, you ought to join his church. But," I said, "does he have something better than a personal visitation of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ to this earth, after centuries of darkness, to usher in the dispensation of the fullness of times and to pronounce judgment upon all the creeds in the world? Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni, with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated? Just think of the knowledge this world has received through that Book of Mormon. Does he have something better than the coming of John the Baptist with the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John with the Melchizedek Priesthood, the holy apostleship, the power to organize the Church and kingdom of God in the earth for the last time, to prepare the way for the coming of the Christ?" And then I went on, "Does he have something better than the coming of Moses and Elijah and Elias? If he has something better than this," I said, "you join his church." Well now, of course, he never joined, but if we just knew these facts and were converted to them, then nothing else in this world would really matter.<br><h2><b>A Waste of Time?</b></h2><br>Many of our missionaries that come out into the mission field have been raised in our Mormon communities; they hardly know what the Church is all about. Some of them don't even know who Adam was. We had a missionary come to us when I was president down in the Southern States. Before his assignment we held a meeting with him and the other missionaries, and he made a statement like this. He said, "I guess I am here to please my mother. My college professors told me that it would be a waste of my time, that I ought to remain at home and get my education." He said, "You know, I am a very practical sort of a fellow. I like to be able to go out in the orchard and pull the pears off of a pear tree; then I know it is a pear tree."<br><br>"Well," I said, "my boy, I wouldn't worry too much about that if I were you. Pears grow on our trees too." I said, "now I'll hand you the Book of Mormon. You are a college man. You study it. You tell me how it could have been written--with the information that is in it--at the time that it was published, if Joseph Smith's story isn't true. And when you get through with that, I will give you another one to start on."<br><br>I assigned him over in Alabama, and a short time after that I went over to attend a conference, and I said to the district president, "I would like to hear from Elder So-and-so," and he called him up. He bore a beautiful testimony. I went up to him after the meeting, and as I shook hands with him I said, "Elder So-and-so, you must have found some pears on our pear tree."<br><br>"Ah, forget it, President Richards," he said. When he came home, he was so thrilled with the gospel--he lived down in St. George--he got the bishop to let him run a tourist service to the temple, and he didn't charge for it, but he just bubbled over.<br><br>We found that so often in the mission field. Here a short time ago a young man returned from down in Argentina. (I knew him and his people back in Washington, D.C.) And I said, "Craig, did you feel like it was a waste of time to be in the mission field, that you ought to have been home getting your education, and getting ready to settle down?"<br><br>"Oh," he said, "Bishop [I'm still a bishop], if the Brethren want to make me happy, just let them put me on the plane tomorrow and send me back to the Argentine." And they had kept him over six months--that's when we were keeping them for two and a half years--so he had been there for three years. He hadn't yet been home to greet his parents and his best girl that he left behind, and yet he said, "If they want to make me happy, just let them load me on the plane and send me back to the Argentine."<br><br>Now, speaking about taking our religion more or less as a matter of fact, during the past summer I have attended quite a number of these youth conferences--one up in North Dakota, one over in Illinois, two here on this campus with stake groups that came here--and we always ended a youth conference with a testimony meeting of the young people. We brethren would get down on the front seat and they would line up on the stand, and as soon as one seat was vacant another young person would be there, and when one was about through bearing testimony, another would be standing right here, waiting for a chance to bear testimony, and, with tears in their eyes and tears in their voices, they would thank God that the Mormon missionaries came to their homes and they would tell what the gospel means to them. Now, that is in the mission field (I'm a missionary). And then the two that we held here on the campus. When it came to the time to bear testimonies, you know, most of the testimonies were given by their leaders that were there, their chaperones; the young people just didn't have it. If I had my way, I would send them all on missions, so they would learn what they really have. And that's what I mean about taking for granted what we have.<br><br>Those of us who have labored in the mission field realize what this experience means to our young people. I think this is the greatest institution in the Church except the mission field, and I have to put that ahead of you because although we don't give them the academic training there we give them something in the mission field--and many of you have experienced that--that is worth far more than just the academic training. I would like to read to you here a statement by Matthew Cowley that he delivered here at Brigham Young University some time ago. He spent ten years in the mission field down in New Zealand. And this is what he said:<br><br><i>As you have heard, I have been on two missions to New Zealand. I have attended two universities, and I will say now, at the outset, if I had my life to live over again, and I had to choose between the missions to New Zealand and my education in two universities, I would select my missions to New Zealand from every standpoint: from the standpoint of education; from the standpoint of spiritual development; of character development, and every other angle of development that we might consider. I would not exchange one for the other for anything. And so, I am pleased to stand before you now, not as a lawyer, not as a college graduate, but as a missionary.</i><br><br>Now any of you who have known the spirit that Brother Matthew Cowley has exhibited in his books and his sermons about missionary work know that that came out of the depths of his heart.<br><br>Now I would like to read you just a little statement from one of my grandsons who was on a mission down in Australia a few years ago. Just to show you what kind of a thrill he had in a Mormon community before he went, this is what he had achieved: he was the junior high boy of the month, president of the junior high school, Mr. Football at his high school, the best athlete in his class at high school for three years, captain of the football and basketball teams, and a member of the all-Church basketball team. You would think that that was about as much of a thrill as anybody would get as a young man. I copied one paragraph from one of his letters that he wrote to me from the mission field, in which he said: "Things are really tremendous down here. I can honestly say I have never been so thrilled and excited and happy in all my life. The Lord is really blessing me." Now, he couldn't get that feeling around here because he just took his membership in the Church for granted. He might in this institution, but not out in the regular wards of the Church.<br><br>We have so many wonderful testimonies of a nature similar to that from the missionaries. We had one young man labor with us down in the South. He had played on BYU's basketball team that won the intermountain championship (we should do it a little oftener). But anyway, he said, "When we won that game, our companions literally carried us around on their shoulders. That was the greatest day of my life, until I came on this mission." And he said, "I would not exchange a night like that [and he was bearing testimony of the restoration of the gospel] for all the basketball games that I have ever played." Now that is what the gospel is when it comes to life, and I hope that here, in this institution, you are doing all you can to help to bring it to life.<br><h2><b>Get the Spirit of the Gospel</b></h2><br>I toured the mission up in Portland, Oregon, some few years ago, and in our testimony meeting one missionary was testifying of the goodness of his companion, and that companion started bawling just like a child--the spirit of the gospel was there--and another missionary said that he would not take a check for a million dollars for the experience of his mission, and he himself was a convert. I sat back of him, and I said to myself, "Would you take a million dollars for your first mission in the little land of Holland?" And I began to count the families that I had been instrumental in brining into the Church. What else could I have done in this world to lay away treasures in heaven like that missionary work that I had done?<br><br>And so I am interested in the spirit of the gospel. Now I think that this institution is the next contributing institution to that spirit. For instance, I was down in Glendale, California, some time ago, and I attended a Relief Society bazaar down there, and it was in part of the territory over which I presided as the stake president years ago. And a young lady, a daughter of one of the families that lived in our stake, told me this story:<br><br>She came up here to the Y. She started keeping company with a boy who had been raised in a Mormon community but didn't know how to appreciate his membership in the Church and wasn't active in the Church. And when he became serious and he proposed to this girl, she said, "I will never marry a man who does not do his duty in the Church and honor his priesthood." She said, "I am going to be able to point to my children and say to them, 'You follow your father.'" Well, he wasn't willing to pay the price. So their courtship ended there. In a short time she started keeping company with another young man. Their engagement was announced in the newspaper, and a friend of the fist suitor sent a copy of that paper to him. He was then living in Chicago. When he read it, he called her up all the way to Los Angeles--that was before we had these cheap rates--and he said, "I cannot live without you. If you will call off that engagement and give me another chance I will do anything and everything you ever asked me to do in the Church." That is what she got by coming here to this institution. And when we met them there, he was a counselor in the bishopric, and I have checked on him since and he has since been the bishop of the ward, and they told me down there that he was the best bishop in that stake. I met him in front of the Hotel Utah here about a year ago; he had just been appointed a member of the stake presidency. Now that is what this institution is planting in the hearts of our young people.<br><br>A young man called me one day and he said, "Is this Bishop Richards?"<br><br>I said, "Yes sir."<br><br>And he said, "Well, I am in trouble."<br><br>I said, "What is your trouble?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "I have been keeping company with a girl for three years, and she heard you preach the other night and now she won't go out with me anymore."<br><br>I said, "Why won't she?"<br><br>He said, "Because I am not active in the Church."<br><br>And I said, "Good for her! I am glad to know that there is at least one girl in Israel who will listen to an old man like me. Now what are you going to do about it?"<br><br>He said, "What can I do?"<br><br>I said, "Get active in the Church, and then go back to her."<br><br>He said, "How can I?"<br><br>I said, "You go and talk to your bishop, and if he doesn't help you, I will be glad to help you."<br><br>Now, I think he must have talked to the bishop all right, because he never has been back.<br><h2><b>Know the Divinity of This Work</b></h2><br>Now, I thank the Lord for this institution; I thank the Lord for what it is doing for you. When we go out in the stakes of Zion where we are nearly all members, and we see that the temple marriages run from twenty-five to about forty percent, and a few of them only may get fifty percent or so, and then we see the record that you make in this institution, that ninety to ninety-six percent of the young people marry in the temple, we feel then that our money is not spent in vain, and these are the dividends that we receive from investing the tithes of the Church.<br><br>If you don't know the gospel's true, I advise you to find it out. You do not have to be old in order to know it. When you have gone down in the waters of baptism, and you have received the Holy Ghost, you can be entitled to the inspiration and the revelation of the Holy Ghost, and you do not need to be old in order to get that witness of the truth of the Church.<br><br>I was down in Sacramento some years ago, and a good sister there, a new convert, told about being on the train on the way to Salt Lake. She lived in San Francisco--she was a Catholic--and there was a little boy on that train about eight or nine years old. And she said, "He was such a cute little fellow, I thought I would try and visit with him." She said, "I tried to talk to him about his school. He did not seem very interested. I tried to talk to him about the games he liked to play. He did not seem very interested." Finally he spoke up and he said, "You are going to Salt Lake, aren't you?"<br><br>And she said, "Yes."<br><br>He said, "Then you are Mormon, aren't you?"<br><br>She said, "No, I am not a Mormon; I am a Catholic."<br><br>He said, "Well, I am a Mormon boy. Would you like me to tell you a little bit about my church?"<br><br>And she said, "Even a Catholic woman could not refuse to listen to an eight- or nine-year-old boy who wanted to talk about his church."<br><br>He told her all about how Joseph Smith did not know which church to join, and how he went out in the woods to pray, and about the revelation that he received of the Father and the Son, and how Moroni brought the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. And then he quoted the Articles of Faith. And she said, "And when he went to bed that night, he slept in the upper berth, and I noticed that his light was burning late." The next morning she said, "It took you a long while to settle down last night."<br><br>He said, "I never go to sleep without reading a chapter out of my Book of Mormon."<br><br>That little fellow so impressed that Catholic woman. Her son met her at the station in Salt Lake and took her over to the Temple Square Hotel. (It's right across from the Temple.) She went over there, she went through with a guide, she bought a copy of the Book of Mormon, and she stayed there till she had read it. She fell into the hands of one of our bishops, and he gave the finishing touches, and she went back to San Francisco a member of this Church because a little eight- or nine-year-old boy had the spirit of testimony. I would rather have my children and my grandchildren enjoy the companionship of the Holy Ghost, a witness of the divinity of this work, than anything else that they can achieve in this life, or any companionship that they can gain.<br><br>I pray that God will bless each one of you with a desire, if you do not have it, to know the divinity of this work. That is the only thing that can bring you back sweet and clean into the presence of God, the Eternal Father. That song of the Primary, "I Am a Child of God"-- if we realize that, then we will want to be like him, and then we will try to live to be worthy of his presence. I ask God the Eternal Father to bless you, each one of you, with a testimony of the divinity of this work that will lead you back into his presence and prepare you for every responsibility and honored privilege that awaits you in this Church, through your faithfulness, and I leave you my love and blessing. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was given at Brigham Young University on 17 October 1972.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>rowth and Lamanite Involvement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, it is a special privilege to be here today in Indian Week and see this large body of Indian students before me. As you know, I have been closely affiliated with the Indian program since its inception this last time. I've given so many talks here on morals I thought maybe something else might be a little interesting to you today, and would like to tell you a little bit about the growth of the great Church--the church to which you belong.<br><h2><b>A Kingdom to Stand Forever</b></h2><br>The growth of the Church is phenomenal. It relates to the Indians, to all the Lamanites, and to all the people of the world, for it has become a great and world church, when only yesterday it was a Utah church. About the time in history when the Lehites came to America, Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. And the great monarch had a dream, with which "his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him" (Dan. 2:1). It seems that the magicians and the astrologers were brought before the king to reveal the dream and its interpretation. They asked him to relate his dream, but he said, "The thing is gone from me." Great rewards were promised these specialists, but they could not recall the dream.<br><br>At this juncture, Daniel, who already had a reputation for spiritual powers, was called to the court of the king. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel said, "But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets. . . . As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter" (Dan. 2:28–29). Here's the dream:<br><br><i>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. . . . This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</i><br><br><i>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</i><br><br><i>Thou sawest . . . a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, . . . and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</i>[Dan. 2:31–35]<br><br>This was an amazing accomplishment, obtained through the revelations of the Lord. Daniel continued:<br><br><i>Thou, O king, . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . art this head of gold. . . .</i><br><br><i>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</i><br><br><i>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron. . . .</i><br><br><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</i><br><br><i>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver. . . .</i>[Dan. 2:37–40, 44]<br><br>Now, this remarkable vision of Nebuchadnezzar, now about 2,500 years old, portrayed the history of the world for many generations. And then Daniel concluded that when Cyrus had conquered Babylon, and Alexander had conquered Cyrus, and the Medes and Persians and the Romans had taken the place of the Macedonian Empire, and the Roman Empire had broken up into many nations in Europe, the great day of the dream would come; and Daniel was inspired to say that--quite unlike the perishable, temporary empires which crumbled, one after another--the God of heaven would set up a kingdom which would never be destroyed, and it would stand forever.<br><br>This stone, cut out of the mountain, is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is the kingdom of God. It is the work of pure revelation--started small, but grown big. It was organized with six members in 1830 and has grown now to over three million. It is permanent; it will never be destroyed. And Daniel concluded his story by saying, "And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure" (Dan. 2:45).<br><h2><b>The Early Growth of the Church</b></h2><br>The Church grows internally by its births and externally by its baptisms and conversions. The Prophet Joseph Smith began missionary work before the Church was organized, and revealed to John and Peter Whitmer that "the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me" (D&amp;amp;C 15:6; 16:6). Nothing is more important than missionary service. And so the missionary work has continued ever since, with some interruptions when wars disturbed it. It must be remembered that the mission is the mother of the stake, and that the purpose of the organization of the Saints within the mission is to develop them to the point where they can be independent stake organizations. It is interesting to note that the Kirtland, Ohio, Stake was organized, the first stake in the world, in February 1834 and was disorganized four years later. And not until 1958 did Ohio have another stake. The Clay-Caldwell Stake in Missouri, organized in 1834, was disorganized in 1846, and Missouri waited a full century for another stake to come in. It seems there must have been something about a curse placed upon states that were unkind to the people of God. The Adam-ondi-Ahman Stake was organized in 1838. These years have all passed, and there still is no stake in Nauvoo. There are signs of spring, however; the buds are bursting, and we now have a restoration program in Nauvoo, an imposing visitor's center, a small branch of the Church, and a corps of missionaries. But they're still waiting for the day of redemption.<br><br>The Chicago Stake came ninety-seven years after the expulsion of the people from Chicago's stake, Illinois. The Iowa, or Zarahemla, Stake was organized in 1839 and was disorganized about two years later. Iowa had no stake again for 124 years. It was Cedar Rapids. The Crooked Creek-Ramas Stake in Illinois was organized in 1840 and disorganized a year and a half later. Lima Stake in Hancock County, Illinois, was organized in 1840. We now have a Lima Stake, thousands of miles south in Peru. The Quincy Stake was organized in 1840. The Mount Hope Stake lasted only seven months. The Freedom Stake, the Geneva Stake, and the Springfield Stakes were organized in 1840. All these stakes of yesteryear have never come back.<br><br>What a setback. When Satan takes over, progress stops and rigor mortis sets in. The fourth stake in the West, and the first in California, was San Bernardino. It lasted seven years. It was to wait seventy-eight years before another stake would be organized in San Bernardino. However, California began its rapid rise when the Los Angeles Stake was organized in 1923 and Hollywood and San Francisco stakes in 1927. And now California has eighty-three stakes.<br><br>The first stake to be organized in the West was Salt Lake Stake in 1847. They celebrated about two weeks ago their 125th anniversary, or their 500th stake conference. It was just two months after the Saints arrived in Salt Lake Valley; apparently it was the only stake in the Church for four years. And then they began coming rather rapidly. There came Weber Stake in Ogden, and then the Provo Stake, which is called now the Utah Stake. Then Parowan and Nephi and Millard and Beaver and Bear Lake and St. George and others, in quick succession.<br><br>Nevada began its stakes with Carson Valley in 1856, for two years of life--probably brought to an end by the Johnston's Army episode.<br><br>When President Joseph Fielding Smith was born, there were in all the world only twenty stakes. Forty-seven years had passed since the Church was organized, and all of the stakes were then in Utah. In 1878, it began to jump borders and found itself in Arizona, with the Little Colorado Stake and the Eastern Arizona Stake. There came soon the Maricopa Stake, in which Elder Stapley grew up. It was fifteen years old when he was born. And a St. Joseph Stake, named for the Prophet Joseph. This stake was born the same year as Brother Hugh B. Brown. It was my stake, the one in which I grew up, in which I was stake clerk about twenty years, where I was second counselor in the stake presidency for twelve years. The Little Colorado Stake became the St. John's Stake. The Snowflake Stake succeeded the Eastern Arizona Stake. Elder LeGrand Richards was one year old at this time.<br><br>By 1893 the Church had jumped the Colorado boundaries with San Luis, where many polygamists had moved for protection. The Church also moved into Idaho and organized the Bannock Stake, and later the Fremont Stake, Rexburg, Oneida, Cassia, Malad, and the first stake in Wyoming was Star Valley.<br><br>The year I was born, the Church crossed the border into Canada. Shortly later, President Nathan Eldon Tanner came into the world. It crossed the border south into old Mexico also, and the Juarez Stake came, also generally to accommodate the polygamists. President Marion G. Romney was born shortly after the stake was started.<br><h2><b>The Twentieth Century</b></h2><br>At the turn of the century, when President Lee was an infant in Clifton, Idaho, and Elder Benson was born in Whitney, nearby, apparently there were forty stakes in the Church, twenty-five of them in Utah. It was now becoming an intermountain church. In the first decade of this century, twenty-one stakes were organized, an average of two a year, most of them in Utah. These were good years also for leadership, since Elders Richard L. Evans and Howard W. Hunter began their earthly work, to culminate in the Council of the Twelve.<br><br>In the second decade, twenty came into existence. This was also a good decade, producing Gordon B. Hinckley of the Twelve. In the third decade, twenty-six stakes were organized. Two more of the apostles came into the world, Elder Packer and Elder Monson. A hundred years had passed since the Church was organized, and eighty-three years since the exodus to Utah. There were now 102 stakes and thirty missions and 672,000 people, mostly in the Far West. It was largely a western Church at this time. This was one stake per year for the century.<br><br>The decade of the 1930s saw the Church population growing fast in California and on the west coast. Only six of the twenty-five stakes were in Utah that decade. But the Church was now moving to new areas: New York, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, and Honolulu. I remember these all very well; they have come in just the last few years, as you know.<br><br>The 1940s were profitable years, and some forty-eight stakes were organized, or about four or five per year. Washington, D.C., Florida, South Carolina were favored. It is of special interest to me that the 146th stake, the Ben Lomond Stake, was the first that I assisted in organizing, after having assisted President Lee in the reorganization of my own stake, Mount Graham. Elder John A. Widtsoe and I made Ben Lomond from the old Ogden Stake in 1943. It is noted now that with stakes from Seattle to Florida and from New York to San Diego the bulk of the Church population was still in the United States. We almost dared not dream of the Church crossing oceans at that time.<br><br>The decade of the fifties saw a strengthening of the stakes in North America. Though California outdid itself with thirty stakes, Utah had forty that decade. And this was sixty percent of the growth. Two unusual events came at this time: the crossing of the equator into the Southern Hemisphere, with Auckland, was only fourteen years ago, the first stake across the ocean; and the creation of student stakes at BYU and USU gave a new color to the picture.<br><br>The last twelve years, the 1960s and the two years of the 1970s, were spectacular growth years in both stakes and missions. Two hundred and fifty-four stakes were organized in the twelve years, or twenty-one per year--more in one year than were organized in seventy years of the nineteenth century. In 1970 alone, we organized forty-one stakes, one every week--which is more than the total stakes in the whole world at the beginning of the century--sixty-three percent in Utah and thirty-seven percent in the rest of the world. So Utah is still the center of Mormondom. It will be noted that Utah still grows, in spite of the limitation in area and population.<br><h2><b>A Worldwide Church</b></h2><br>This was the period of expanding to a world church status. With the organization of many new missions and numerous stakes abroad, the Church truly became international and took on world stature. Daniel must have looked down and been very proud of the little stone that was cut out of the mountains and now was rolling forth till it would fill the whole earth. And as you hear these statistics, you'll see that the mountain stone will cover the whole earth, and it almost has already. The stone without hands, which rose into many areas across the seas and extends now from Tokyo Stake to the Transvaal in South Africa, and from Perth in Western Australia to Alaska, and from Scotland to Buenos Aires. There are now four stakes in Tonga, nine in Britain, eight in Australia, six in Mexico, five in Samoa, five in Germany, seven in New Zealand, eight or ten in South America, and stakes in many large cities of the world. I said eight or ten in South America because I think one or two were organized last Sunday and I haven't yet been advised.<br><br>There are now about thirty stakes in Lamanite countries. Well, that was unthought of when we first started working with the Indians just a few years ago. This is the day of the Lamanite, and they are receiving the gospel with great eagerness. Percentagewise, they are increasing more rapidly than the non-Lamanites--Mexico, Central America, South America, the islands of the sea.<br><br>About the time of my birth there were thirty-seven stakes in the whole Church, and now there are twice that many overseas--just overseas--and almost that many that are Lamanite, all or in large measure. How do you think Samuel the Lamanite must feel, to look down and see thirty stakes of Lamanites in the islands, and so on? How do you think he would feel to see Lamanites conducting the meetings at the pulpit, doing the singing, playing the piano, and organizing and carrying forward the work of the Lord?<br><br>Just twelve years ago, in 1960, it was my privilege to organize four stakes in Australia and New Zealand, including the Hawkes Bay Stake, which was all Lamanite--the first in the world--and now we've got enough almost to organize a stake right here in this congregation. It shows how the little stone, rolling through the whole world, will fill the world, as it's already begun to do. Then the Hawkes Bay Stake consisted of all Lamanites but two: the president was an American; one of the high councilors came from Britain. All the others were Lamanites.<br><br>We return again to Daniel's prediction: the small stone becoming the great mountain and filling the earth, including the Orient, continental Europe, Great Britain, South Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, the South Pacific. The growth of the Church, I say, is phenomenal, and nothing can stop it; and, as Daniel said, it will never be destroyed or given to another people. It's here to stay until the end of time.<br><br>When the Church jumped the oceans--and the plains and the mountains and the equator--language training became necessary. Accordingly, we have now three language training schools: at Provo, Ricks College, and the Church College of Hawaii. And we're training in many languages and teaching the gospel in nineteen, I believe.<br><br>Mosiah said: "The time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (Mosiah 15:28). And Joseph Smith must be smiling too, remembering a revelation he received in 1833: "Every man shall hear the fullness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language" (D&amp;amp;C 90:11). We must learn languages. We are a linguist people, having been teaching the gospel for many years in many tongues.<br><br>Now it's evident that we must use other media than tracting. And the Lord has provided us these tools. He's given to us the radio, the television, the transistor, the newspaper, the magazine, the airplane, and worldwide transportation. The total communication, and the world has become one great community.<br><br>Back to South America. I met one day a young Peruvian, way back in the hinterlands of Peru, beyond the trains and beyond the bus lines, where we had to go in a car, and he said to me, "I think I heard you the other day on my transistor." He was in Peru; I was in Salt Lake City, in the general conference. But he heard my talk, which had been broadcast, I think, to the Telstar, and then to Buenos Aires, and then back to Lima, and then out into the wilderness. From this remote settlement, about as far away as you could get, he had heard, through this little pocket instrument, some of the general conference; and I realized that transistor radios would come smaller and smaller and would cost less and less money, until the people behind the curtains would hear it, and everybody in the world, nearly, could afford one of these little transistor radios, which would be pocket size.<br><br>We ask the stake presidencies and bishoprics to encourage you young people to retain the languages after you've been abroad, for there will be need for people to write scripts, to act in plays, to write articles, to broadcast, to interpret, to teach, and to serve in all the languages of the world.<br><br>From<i>Time</i>magazine I clipped an article two or three years ago, and I would quote a few paragraphs from it:<br><br><i>In terms of human lives, one of the most revolutionary inventions in this age of communication is the transistor radio. In much the same way that printing opened up vast new possibilities to the fifteenth-century Europe, the transistor is letting in the world to hundreds of millions still isolated from the twentieth century by geography, poverty, and exploitation. Transistors sway from the long necks of plodding camels deep in Saudi desert and from the horns of oxen plowing the furrows in Costa Rica. A visitor to an Ecuadorian linga, in which the Indians come together for communal road building, calculated that at least one tiny transistor radio was sounding every twenty yards along the two-mile road. The cheapness and portability of the transistor set has given the medium a new mobility and a new dimension. For Peru's twelve million inhabitants, there are more than 800 radio stations, and radio reaches the ears of virtually every man, woman, and child in the country. In Guatemala six times as many people listen to radio as read newspapers. Black Africa, which had fewer than four hundred thousand radios in 1955, has at least six million today. In rice field or rain forest, compound or croft, the mere possession of a transistor radio confers status on its owner, who has, perhaps, gone hungry to make his down payment and worked a little harder to keep the installments up.</i><br><br>The work of the Lord has grown. The missionary work has gone forward with increasing vigor. The hundredth stake was Lehi in just 1929, and it took the Church ninety-eight years to get the first hundred stakes. The two hundredth stake was East Ogden, 1952; it took only twenty-four years to make that second hundred. The three hundredth stake was Toronto, and it took only eight years to create that hundred. Medford, Oregon, was the four hundredth stake, and it took only four years to make this group. Fallon, Nevada, was the five hundredth stake. The six hundredth stake is yet to be organized, but Rio de Janeiro was organized two weeks ago to make 589.<br><h2><b>Our Responsibility to Teach</b></h2><br>Now comes the responsibility to teach the gospel to the world, with all the media and the facilities available. The Lord has said many times, "Go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, in his own tongue and in his own language." We have a great responsibility. Every normal Latter-day Saint boy, including every Indian boy, should grow up saving his money, and building himself, and perfecting himself, so that when he is of proper age he will fill a mission. And with the tremendously rich promises to the Lamanites, every Indian boy should be about the most eager of all to go. Some young women may go. We could send forty thousand today instead of sixteen thousand if we were really converted as a total people to this program.<br><br>In war, in spite of the tanks, the big guns, the explosives, and the planes, they must always have the infantry to do the cleaning up. The missionary work is a little like that. We'll always need missionaries to do the personalized teaching and to do the baptisms and organization, even though the mass media may bring millions of people to know the gospel and to believe it. If other countries would provide missionaries in sufficient numbers to supply their own needs, there could be released immediately seventy-five hundred missionaries from the United States who are now serving in those countries that haven't caught the vision yet of their missionary service. It is possible that our very lassitude and casualness could be the reason we have not expanded farther. And I am positive that when we are prepared with missionaries the Lord will open up new fields for us, fields that now are closed.<br><br>Most of the missionaries could supply most of the funds for their missions if they would. Many have spent their money for cars and for motorcycles and for skiing equipment and for a lot of other things, whereas if the mission were their obsession they could take care of much of their own costs. In overseas countries, where the economy is distressed, the same process of financing should be followed. But there we have also the First Presidency's fund and the First Council of the Seventy's fund to supplement where it is necessary. Frequently a prospect can get employment and save his money until he has a reasonable amount. Let me tell you of one young man in the central West I interviewed for a mission. I asked him about his finances; he said, "Oh, the elders quorum is going to take care of it."<br><br>And I said, "Oh, no, the elders quorum isn't going to take care of it. Who is going to take care of your finances?"<br><br>And he said, "Oh, the elders quorum. They said they would."<br><br>I said, "No, we send no missionaries totally supported by anyone else. They must make a contribution themselves."<br><br>And so I started to go to make my next appointment, and he said, "Wait a minute, Brother Kimball. I've got a collection of guns that are very valuable. And I could get hundreds of dollars for them. I'll sell them." And he said, "I've got some musical instruments. I won't need them while I'm on my mission, and I can sell them. And I can make quite a sizable contribution toward my mission." A few weeks later, I met him in Salt Lake on his way to his mission.<br><h2><b>The Day of the Lamanite</b></h2><br>The world is awakening to the possibilities and the realm of the gospel. The Lamanites all over this world are seeming to remember something they knew before. There comes to mind an experience of Brother Boyd Packer. We attended a sacrament meeting in a little branch in Cuzco. The chapel was quiet. The opening exercises were finished and the sacrament meeting in preparation. A little Lamanite ragamuffin entered from the street. Calloused and chappy were the little feet that brought him in the open door, up the aisle, and to the sacrament table. Here was dark and dirty testimony of deprivation, want, and unsatisfied hunger, spiritual as well as physical. Almost unobserved, he slyly came to the sacrament table, and with a seeming spiritual hunger, he leaned against the table and lovingly rubbed his unwashed face against the cool, smooth, white linen. A woman in the front seat, seemingly outraged by the intrusion, caught his eye, and with motion and frown sent the little ragamuffin scampering down the aisle, out into his world, the street. A bit later the little urchin, seemingly compelled by some inner urge, overcame his timidity and came stealthily, cautiously, down the aisle again, fearful, ready to escape if necessary, but impelled as though directed by inaudible voices with a friendly and familiar spirit, and as though memories long and faded were reviving, as though some intangible force were crowding him on to seek something for which he yearned but could not identify. From his seat on the stand, Brother Packer caught his eye, beckoned to him, and stretched out his big welcoming arms. After a moment's hesitation, the little Lamanite ragamuffin was nestled comfortably on his lap, in his arms. The tousled head against the great warm heart, a heart sympathetic to waifs, and especially the Lamanite ones.<br><br>Later Elder Packer, with a subdued voice, recalled this incident to me. As he sat forward on his chair, his eyes glistening, emotion in his voice, he said: "As this little one relaxed in my arms, it seemed it was not a single little Lamanite I held; it was a nation. Indeed, a multitude of nations, deprived, hungering souls, wanting something deep, good, and warm they could not explain. A humble people, yearning to revive memories all but faded out, of ancestors standing wide-eyed, open-mouthed, expectant, and excited. A people reaching for truths they seemed to remember only vaguely, for prophecies which surely would someday be fulfilled, looking up and seeing a holy, glorified being descend from celestial areas, and hearing a voice say, 'Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And in me hath the Father glorified his name. I am the Light and the Life of the world.'"<br><br>The day of the Lamanite is surely here, and we are God's instruments in helping to bring to pass the prophecies of renewed vitality, acceptance of the gospel, and resumption to a favored place as a part of God's chosen people.<br><br>And now may I conclude with a picture of this Indian woman of Bolivia, painted by Walter S. Miller, and coming from the<i>Maryknoll</i>magazine:<br><br><i>There she sits, with many of her tribe, on the rock wall bordering the road from La Paz to the plateau above. Her little brown derby hat is like the hundreds of others along the way. Her eyes are squinting, since the upturned brim on the little hat does not protect them from the glaring sun. Her face, wrinkled, exaggerates her age, and her nose says she's a Lamanite. Her hair wiggles its way out from under the derby in long strings, her lips are cracked and her hands are chapped. The red shawl covers her upper body, and the modest skirt hangs to her feet. She's looking off into space and thinking, thinking deeply. The missionaries have just left. They've been telling her strange and unusual things about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And this is what she's saying to herself:</i><br><br><i>For me? You say it was for me</i><br><i>The Son of God came down to earth,</i><br><i>Born just as any Indian babe,</i><br><i>Then, bundled up, was laid upon the hay--</i><br><i>How could it be? How could it be?</i><br><br><i>Where is He now? Does He live far away?</i><br><i>Show me the trail! Please tell me more of Him.</i><br><i>How I should like to see Him! Yet I'm old:</i><br><i>I cannot walk the trails as once I could;</i><br><i>And mountain paths are steep.</i><br><i>So, if I went, I'd have to travel slow.</i><br><i>Would you go with me, if I were to go?</i><br><br><i>"Come unto me!" Those words included me?</i><br><i>He calls for ME? You're SURE He calls for me?</i><br><i>Would He receive ME, if I came to Him?</i><br><i>He CARES for me? You say He cares for ME!</i><br><i>Ah, then, I'll come--my heart cries out for Him!</i><br><i>Oh, that I might have known Him long ago, when I was wee.</i><br><i>To think I almost missed Him! And He came FOR ME!</i><br>[By Walter S. Miller]<br><br>God bless the Lamanites, the Lamanite cause, the whole program, and all of you students, and Brigham Young University with all the good it is doing, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1>l Thought and Life of J. Reuben Clark, Jr. - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, President. This is a great opportunity, brethren and sisters, and a great responsibility. I'm honored to have the invitation to say a few words about the political life and thought of President J. Reuben Clark. I have here my opinion of him that appears in the book<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution</i>. I'll not have time to read it to you, but before I start on my assigned theme I would like to say just a word about President Clark as a kind, thoughtful, generous man and a congenial companion.<br><br>I don't know anyone who was more thoughtful of us who worked under his direction. Whenever one of us was absent because of illness, he daily inquired concerning our welfare. He was ever solicitous about our safety as we traveled. Repeatedly he warned us against taking chances, and he frequently reprimanded us when we did take chances. I remember on one occasion I drove through a raging storm between Burley, Idaho, and Salt Lake City. He knew I was on a welfare assignment, so he telephoned my home several times before I arrived. Soon after I arrived, the phone rang again. "Marion," he said, "where have you been?" And I told him. "Did you come through that storm?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Alone?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>He then proceeded to give me a Scotch blessing. As soon as I could get him off the line, I began to tell my wife in vehement terms what I thought about his reprimand. In the midst of my fury the phone rang again, and he said, "Marion, this is President Clark. I'm just calling you up in the spirit of the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants," referring, of course, to the statement, "reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy" (D&amp;amp;C 121:43).<br><br>At his invitation I, on one occasion, rode with him in his stateroom on a train from Salt Lake to Boise, Idaho, and back. When we went to bed that night, he said, "Marion, I hope I don't keep you awake with my snoring."<br><br>And I said, "Well, how shall I awaken you if you do?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "Sister Clark used to nudge me in the ribs with her elbow, but I don't want you taking any such liberties."<br><br>But now to my assigned subject. As I have pondered the assignment to speak about the political thought and life of President Clark, I have concluded that the best way to do this, and the most effective way, is to let him speak for himself. I shall therefore quote extensively from his writings and talks. I'll not tell you every tie I slide from his language into mine; if you can't tell the difference I'll be very complimented. The quotations, however, are all noted in the manuscript, and they, when not otherwise given, are from the book<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution.</i><br><h2><b>Common and Civil Law</b></h2><br>The central concern in all of President Clark's political thinking was the maintenance of a government and laws which would protect the right of every man to "act in doctrine and principle . . . according to the moral agency which [God has] given him" (D&amp;amp;C 101:77–78). His consistency and his effectiveness resulted from the fact that he always tested his thinking and conformed to the precepts of the Common Law, the Constitution of the United States, and the scriptures--all three of which he believed to be divinely inspired and historically vindicated.<br><br>He was thoroughly acquainted with history, particularly political history. He believed that the roots of the desired government and laws are to be found in the English Common Law and that the roots of despotic government and slavery are to be found in the Civil Law.<br><br><i>As of the time of the writing of the Constitution, there were</i>[he said]<i>two great systems of law in the world--the Civil Law. . . . and the Common Law. . . .</i>[p. 138]<br><br><i>. . . the basic concept of these two systems was as opposite as the poles--in the Civil Law the source of all law is the personal ruler; . . . he</i>[the ruler]<i>is sovereign. In the Common Law, . . . the source of all law is the people; they, as a whole, are sovereign.</i><br><br><i>During the centuries, these two systems have had an almost deadly rivalry for the control of society, the Civil Law and its fundamental concepts being the instrument through which ambitious men of genius and selfishness have set up and maintained despotisms; the Common Law, with its basic principles, being the instrument through which men of equal genius, but with the love of mankind burning in their souls, have established and preserved liberty and free institutions. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Civil Law was developed by Rome. . . .</i>[p. 139]<br><br><i>The people under this system have those rights, powers, and privileges, and those only which the sovereign considers are for their good or for his advantage. He adds or takes away as suits his royal pleasure. All the residuum of power is in the Emperor. Under this system, the people look into the law to see what they may do. They may only do what the Emperor has declared they may do. . . . Under our common law system, we look into the law to see what we may not do, for we may do everything we are not forbidden to do.</i><br><br><i>This civil law concept explains why, over the centuries, it has been possible for the head of a state, operating under this concept, to establish with comparative ease a dictatorship.</i><br><br><i>We must always remember that despotism and tyranny, with all their attendant tragedies to the people, as in Russia today, come to nations because one man, or a small group of men, seize and exercise by themselves the three great divisions of government--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. . . . When the</i>[Civil Law]<i>concept has been operative,</i>[peoples]<i>have suffered the resulting tragedies--</i>[such as]<i>loss of liberty, oppression, great poverty among the masses, insecurity,</i>[and]<i>wanton disregard of human life. . . .</i>[pp. 144–45]<br><h2><b>Concepts of the Founding Fathers</b></h2><br><i>Near the beginning of our Revolution</i>[says President Clark]<i>, the representatives of the people</i>[knowing this history]<i>met in Philadelphia and issued their great proclamation, the Declaration of Independence. They solemnly announced:</i><br><br><i>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. . . ."</i><br><br><i>The representatives of the people were . . . speaking, . . . they spoke the things that were in their hearts, for which they were ready to die, and</i>[for which many of them]<i>did die. . . .</i><br><br><i>Twelve years after the Declaration, . . . the representatives of the people again met in Philadelphia in the same hall and framed the Constitution. The Preamble to that inspired document laid down the great purposes to accomplish which the new government was set up. It declared:</i><br><br><i>"WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this CONSTITUTION for the United States of America."</i><br><br><i>Here the people were speaking as sovereign, not an Emperor, nor a small, self-appointed group assuming to be sovereign. The people declared that they were so acting and did so act by adopting the Constitution. They formally declared: "We the people . . . do ordain and establish." This is the difference between liberty and despotism.</i>[pp. 145–47]<br><br>President Clark did not think this government was "set up as an eleemosynary government to feed and clothe and nurture all the rest of the world. [But that] it was set up for the purpose of establishing a government which should bring peace and prosperity to the people of this nation" (p. 103).<br><br><i>Deeply read in history, steeped in the lore of the past in human government, and experienced in the approaches of despotism which they had, themselves, suffered at the hands of George the Third, these patriots, assembled in solemn convention, planned for the establishment of a government that would ensure to them the blessings they described in the Preamble. The people were setting up the government. They were bestowing power. They gave to the government the powers they wished to give; they retained what they did not wish to give. The residuum of power was in them</i>[the people]. [p. 147]<br><br>President Clark viewed the Constitution of the United States as embodying the loftiest concepts yet framed for the establishment of liberty and free institutions. He believed that "the warp and the woof of the great fabric of Constitutional government which was finally woven out of the toil and hardship, the suffering and death of our patriot fathers" were such virtues as truthfulness, prayerfulness, and patience (pp. 14–16).<br><h2><b>Separation and Fusion of Governmental Functions</b></h2><br>Now I come to the most important part of President Clark's philosophy of government and his idea of the Constitution. It is in the "separation and fusion of governmental functions." It was his opinion that in providing for the separation and fusion of governmental functions the members of the Constitutional Convention reached their zenith.<br><br><i>The Framers</i>[he said].<i>in the Government they provided for, separated the three functions of government, and set each of them up as a separate branch--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each was wholly independent of the other. No one of them might encroach upon the other. No one of them might delegate its powers to another.</i><br><br><i>Yet by the Constitution, the different branches were bound together, unified into an efficient, operating whole. These branches stood together, supported one another. While severally independent, they were at the same time, mutually dependent. It is this union of independence and dependence of these branches--legislative, executive, and judicial--and of the governmental functions possessed by each of them, that constitutes the marvelous genius of this unrivalled document. The Framers had no direct guide in this work, no historical governmental precedent upon which to rely. As I see it</i>[concluded President Clark],<i>it was here that the divine inspiration came. It was truly a miracle.</i>[pp. 147–48]<br><br>It is in our failure to observe the separation of powers thus provided for by the Constitution which, in President Clark's thinking, has today put our Constitutional freedoms in jeopardy. For a masterful discussion of this particular phase of his political thought, see his great discourse, "Let Us Not Sell Our Children into Slavery" (<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution,</i>pp. 133–58).<br><br>Although he was passionately patriotic and loyal to the Constitution, President Clark did not think it was perfect. In fact, he said on one occasion:<br><br><i>In my own view the most pressing amendment to our Constitution is one that would lengthen the Presidential term to six years and then make the President ineligible for re-election. This would make the President a Chief Executive for his full term, instead of a scheming politician for the first four years.</i>[p. 24]<br><h2><b>Amending the Constitution</b></h2><br>He insisted, however, that amendments be made in the manner prescribed in the Constitution. This he said in a priesthood meeting:<br><br><i>I should like to point out to you that in that inspired document, the Constitution, the Lord prescribed the way, the procedure by which the inspired framework of that Constitution could be changed. Whenever the Constitution is amended in that way, it will be an amendment that the Lord will approve; but whenever it is amended in any other way than He prescribed, we are not following the commandment of the Lord and must expect to lose our liberties and freedom.</i><br><br><i>The Constitution was framed in order to protect minorities. That is the purpose of written constitutions. In order that minorities might be protected in the matter of amendments under our Constitution, the Lord required that the amendments should be made only through the operation of very large majorities--two-thirds for action in the Senate, and three-fourths as among the states. This is the inspired, prescribed order.</i><br><br><i>But if we are to have an amendment by the will of one man, or of a small group of men, if they can amend the Constitution, then we shall lose the Constitution; because each succeeding person or group who come into a position of place and power where they can "amend" the charter, will want to amend it again, and so on until no vestige of our liberties shall remain. Thus it comes that an amendment of our Constitution by one person or by a group is a violation of the revealed will of the Lord to the Church, as that will is embodied in that inspired Constitution.</i><br><br><i>Brethren, let us think about that, because I say unto you with all the soberness I can, that we stand in danger of losing our liberties, and that once lost, only blood will bring them back; and once lost, we of this Church will, in order to keep the Church going forward, have more sacrifices to make and more persecutions to endure than we have yet known, heavy as our sacrifices and grievous as our persecutions of the past have been.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1944, pp. 115–116]<br><h2><b>Foreign Affairs</b></h2><br>Now a word as to his point of view and thought with respect to foreign affairs. In the field of foreign affairs, President Clark's political thinking was deep and certain. He knew that "it was Jefferson who developed the great doctrine of American neutrality" (p. 24) and that Washington, in his farewell address, laid down "the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations," to wit (and he's quoting now from Washington): that "in extending our commercial relations [we should] have with them as little political connections as possible" (p. 108); and that "it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world" (p. 109).<br><br>President Clark also knew that this great doctrine of American neutrality was born of bitter experience; that between 1689 and 1763, the century before the forming of the Constitution, the colonists had fought four wars in America merely because the mother countries were fighting in Europe.<br><br><i>In none of them were we concerned as to their causes. They cost us a lot of lives and money. We fought only because we were entangled in European affairs.</i><br><br><i>When the Revolutionary War broke some twelve years later, these experiences were fresh in the minds of our Founding Fathers.</i>[p. 100]<br><br>Against this background, President Clark, in his great lecture "Our Dwindling Sovereignty," given February 13, 1952, at the University of Utah, declared:<br><br><i>I am a confirmed isolationist, a political isolationist, first, I am sure, by political instinct, next, from experience, observation, and patriotism, and lastly, because, while isolated, we built the most powerful nation in the world, a nation that provided most of prosperity to all its citizens, . . . most of popular education, most of freedom, most of peace, most of blessing by example to other nations, . . . of any nation, past or present, on the face of this earth. I stand for the possession of, and exercise by our nation of a full, complete, and unimpaired sovereignty that will be consistent with our membership in the Society of Nations.</i><br><br><i>In so declaring I have no diffidence, no apology, no shame. On the contrary, I have a great pride in the fact that I stand where the Revolutionary Fathers stood, who fought for, and gained our independence--Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Monroe . . . . I stand with Lincoln and Seward, . . . with Cleveland and Olney, . . . and with Theodore Roosevelt. . . .</i><br><br><i>I am pro-Constitution, pro-Government, as it was established under the Constitution, pro-free institutions, as they have been developed under and through the Constitution, pro-liberty, pro-freedom, pro-full and complete independence and sovereignty, pro-local self-government, and pro-everything else that has made us the free country we had grown to be in the first 130 years of our national existence.</i><br><br><i>It necessarily follows that I am anti-internationalist, anti-interventionist, anti-meddlesome-busybodiness in our international affairs. In the domestic field, I am anti-socialist, anti-Communist, anti-Welfare State. . . .</i><br><br><i>As I proceed, some will say, "Oh, he is talking about the past; but this is a new world, new conditions, new problems," and so on. To this I will content myself with answering--human nature does not change; in its basic elements it now is as it was at the dawn of history, as our present tragic plight shows. Even savages inflict no greater inhumanities than are going on in the world today.</i><br><br><i>In the mad thrusting of ourselves, with a batch of curative political nostrums, into the turmoil and tragedy of today's world, we are like a physician called in to treat a virulent case of smallpox, and whose treatment consists in getting into bed with his patient. That is not the way to cure smallpox.</i>[pp. 95–97]<br><h2><b>Monroe Doctrine</b></h2><br>Now just a word on the Monroe Doctrine:<br><br><i>. . . (October 24, 1823), Jefferson, writing to President Monroe about the proposed Monroe Doctrine, said:</i><br><br><i>"Our first and fundamental maxim should be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe; our second, never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic affairs."</i>[p. 109]<br><br>The natural follow-up on this statement of Jefferson, that we should "never . . . suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic affairs," would be a consideration of the Monroe Doctrine with which President Clark strongly agreed and upon which he was a renowned authority. Lack of time forbids a discussion of it here.<br><br>Now, President Clark was convinced that "in establishing [the United States] government, God moved forward, according to His promise and declared purpose as set out in Holy Writ, to make this land "a land choice above all other lands." This is the great motif which runs through our whole history" (p. 11).<br><br>"The Lord declared the purpose of this Constitution when He said it 'should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh'" (p. 186; also D&amp;amp;C 101:77). President Clark added: "It has been the United States that has always been called to carry forward the banner of human liberty and religious freedom," and that, with the abolition of slavery, "God had almost finished His fashioning of this land to meet His purposes, to make this a land of liberty and a place where God may be worshipped without let or hindrance. He had bestowed upon us all the essentials needed to earn His fullest blessings" (pp. 192–93).<br><br>It was his further vision that the Constitutional government and law of the United States would be the pattern for all nations:<br><br><i>This leaven</i>[said he]<i>of local self-government, of division of independent governmental functions, of realms of freedom and liberty beyond the reach of government, is working in the far-off corners of the earth. The commonwealths of the South Seas, basically framed along the lines set up by our Constitution, are bringing other lands to enjoy our blessings.</i>[pp. 193–94]<br><h2><b>Our Destiny</b></h2><br>As to our destiny, he said:<br><br><i>And this is the mission and the destiny of America, of Zion, decreed thousands of years ago, for . . . Isaiah declared: "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."</i>[Isaiah 2:3]<br><br><i>And this destiny of ours is to come not through bloody conquests of war and the oppression and enslavement of our fellow-beings, but by conquests of peace and the persuasion of righteous example and Christian endeavor.</i><br><br><i>Thus far God has wrought out His plan. He will carry it through--with us, if we are faithful."</i>[p. 194]<br><br><i>I repeat, it is my faith</i>[this is still President Clark speaking]<i>that God Himself looks with favor, has looked with favor, upon this government, that He still has its protection in His mind, and that if we, His children, will try to live as He has told us to live, if we will exercise the great Christian virtues, that then His protecting hand will still be over us, and that we will be safe. That it may be so, I pray."</i>[pp. 93–94]<br><br>In which prayer I join, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G. Romney was second counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 November 1972.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Christmas - Howard W. Hunter - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The time is drawing near when books will be closed and hearts and thoughts turned toward home. Like the shepherds of old who journeyed to the manger marked by the star, many of you will travel to a place where a special star hangs over your home--a holy place, a place where love and confidence increase with the years.<br><br>Christmas is a busy season. Streets and stores are filled with people making last-minute preparations. Travelers on the highways increase, airports are crowded--all Christianity seems to come to life with music, lights, and festive decorations.<br><br>A writer has said:<br><br><i>Of all the holidays there is none that enters so fully into the human heart, and stirs so many of the higher sentiments. The thoughts, memories, hopes, and customs linked with it are bound by antiquity and nationality collectively; and by childhood and old age individually. They embrace the religious, social, and patriotic sides of our nature. The holly and mistletoe entwined among the evergreens, the habit of giving gifts to those we love, the presence of the Christmas tree, the superstition of Santa Claus, all combining to make Christmas the most longed-for, the most universal, and from every standpoint, the most important holiday known to man.</i>[Clarence Baird, "The Spirit of Christmas,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>23:154 (December 1919)]<br><h2><b>The Origin of Christmas</b></h2><br>The season is steeped in tradition and its roots stem back in history. The commencement of the holiday lies in pagan worship long before the introduction of Christianity. The god Mithra was worshiped by the ancient Aryans, and this worship gradually spread to India and Persia. Mithra at first was the god of the heavenly light of the bright skies and later in the Roman period was worshiped as the deity of the sun, or the sun-god--<i>Sol Invictus Mithra.</i><br><br>In the first century after Christ, Pompey carried on conquests along the southern coast of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, and many of the prisoners taken in those military actions were brought captive to Rome. This introduced the pagan worship of Mithra to Rome, for these prisoners spread the religion among the Roman soldiers. The worship became popular, particularly in the ranks of the Roman armies. We find today, in the ruins of the cities of the far-flung Roman Empire, the shrines of Mithra. Mithraism flourished in the Roman world and became the chief competitor of Christianity in the religious beliefs of the people.<br><br>A festive season for the worshipers of the sun-god took place immediately after the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year--the time when the sun stands still after its annual dip into the Southern Hemisphere. The commencement of its climb from this low point was regarded as the rebirth of Mithra, and the Romans celebrated his birthday on the twenty-fifth of December each year. There was great merriment on this holiday--festivals and feastings, gifts given to friends, and the dwelling places decorated with evergreens.<br><br>Gradually Christianity gained a victory over Mithraism, which had been its strongest rival, and the festival day celebrating the birth of Mithra was used by the Christians to commemorate the birth of Christ. The pagan worship of the sun, deeply rooted in Roman culture, was replaced by one of the greatest festivals among Christians. Christmas has come down to us as a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing--a day of good cheer and goodwill to men. Although it has an earthly relation and significance, it is divine in content. The ancient Christian celebration has lived continuously through the centuries.<br><h2><b>The Meaning of Christmas Today</b></h2><br>How is Christmas regarded today? The legend of Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, the decorations of tinsel and mistletoe, and the giving of gifts all express to us the spirit of the day we celebrate; but the true spirit of Christmas lies much deeper than these. It is found in the life of the Savior, in the principles he taught, in his atoning sacrifice--which becomes our great heritage.<br><br>Many years ago the First Presidency of the Church made this significant statement:<br><br><i>Christmas, to the Latter-day Saint, is both reminiscent and prophetic--a reminder of two great and solemn events, which will yet be regarded universally as the mightiest and most wonderful happenings in the history of the human race. These events were predestined to take place upon this planet before it was created. One of these was the coming of the Savior in the meridian of time, to die for the sins of the world; and the other is the prospective event of the risen and glorified Redeemer, to reign upon the earth as King of kings.</i>[<i>Millennial Star,</i>70:1 (January 2, 1908)]<br><br>In Paul's short letter to the Galatians, he showed great concern over their apparent disbelief and their forsaking of his teachings regarding Christ. He wrote to them: "But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you. ..." (Gal. 4:18–19). In other words, Paul expressed himself as suffering pain and anxiety until Christ be "formed" in them. This is another way of saying "in Christ," as that expression is used by Paul repeatedly in his writings.<br><br>It is possible for Christ to be born in men's lives, and when such an experience actually happens, a man is "in Christ"--Christ is "formed" in him. This presupposes that we take Christ into our hearts and make him the living contemporary of our lives. He is not just a general truth or a fact in history, but the Savior of men everywhere and at all times. When we strive to be Christlike, he is "formed" in us; if we open the door, he will enter; if we seek his counsel, he will counsel us. For Christ to be "formed" in us, we must have a belief in him and in his atonement. Such a belief in Christ, and the keeping of his commandments, are not restraints upon us. By these, men are set free. This Prince of Peace waits to give peace of mind which may make each of us a channel of that peace.<br><br>The real Christmas comes to him who has taken Christ into his life as a moving, dynamic, vitalizing force. The real spirit of Christmas lies in the life and mission of the Master. I continue with what the writer defines as the real spirit of Christmas:<br><br><i>It is a desire to sacrifice for others, to render service and to possess a feeling of universal brotherhood. It consists of a willingness to forget what you have done for others, and to remember what others have done for you; to ignore what the world owes you, and think only of your duties in the middle distance, and your chance to do good and aid your fellow-men in the foreground--to see that your fellow-men are just as good as you are, and try to look behind their faces to their hearts--to close your book of grievances against the universe, and look about you for a place to sow a few seeds of happiness, and go your way unobserved.</i>[Baird, p. 154]<br><br>In his contemplation of the Christmas season, John Wallingford penned these lines:<br><br><i>Christmas is not a day or a season, but a</i><br><i>condition of heart and mind.</i><br><i>If we love our neighbors as ourselves;</i><br><i>if in our riches we are poor in spirit and in</i><br><i>our poverty we are rich in grace;</i><br><i>if our charity vaunteth not itself, but suffereth long and is kind;</i><br><i>if when our brother asks for a loaf, we give</i><br><i>ourselves instead;</i><br><i>if each day dawns in opportunity and sets in</i><br><i>achievement, however small;</i><br><i>then every day is Christ's day and Christmas</i><br><i>is always near.</i><br><br>A wise man has said:<br><br><i>The most amazing thing about the Christmas story is its relevance. It is at home in every age and fits into every mood of life. It is not simply a lovely tale once told, but eternally contemporary. It is the voice crying out in every wilderness. It is as meaningful in our time as in that long-ago night when shepherds followed the light of the star to the manger of Bethlehem.</i>[Joseph R. Sizoo,<i>Words of Life,</i>p. 33]<br><br>It has been said that Christmas is for children; but as the years of childhood fancy pass away and an understanding maturity takes their place, the simple teaching of the Savior that "it is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35) becomes a reality. The evolution from a pagan holiday transformed into a Christian festival, to the birth of Christ in men's lives, is another form of maturity that comes to one who has been touched by the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Find the True Spirit of Christmas</b></h2><br>If you desire to find the true spirit of Christmas and partake of the sweetness of it, let me make this suggestion to you. During the hurry of the festive occasion of this Christmas season, find time to turn your heart to God. Perhaps in the quiet hours, and in a quiet place, and on your knees--alone or with loved ones--give thanks for the good things that have come to you, and ask that his spirit might dwell in you as you earnestly strive to serve him and keep his commandments. He will take you by the hand and his promises will be kept.<br><br>I know that God lives. I bear witness of the divinity of his Son, the Savior of the world, and I express appreciation for the blessing of having upon the earth a prophet of the living God.<br><br>In closing I would like to say that President Harold B. Lee has asked that I extend to you his love and the heartfelt greetings of the Board of Trustees to the administration, the faculty, and the student body of this great university.<br><br>May God bless each of you this day and always is the prayer I humbly ask. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Howard W.
