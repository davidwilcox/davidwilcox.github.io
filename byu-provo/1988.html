<h1>ersity of Mortality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Your Turn</b></h2><br>Imagine with me a scene from the premortal existence. The time is about two decades ago, plus or minus a few years. We see an eager spirit at the front window watching the mailbox located out by the street. The mailman arrives and a delivery is made. The spirit rushes out to the mailbox with great anticipation that a long-awaited letter has been delivered.<br><br>Plowing through the usual junk mail and monthly statements, we see a large white envelope. This may be it! Eagerly the letter is opened. Your name and address heads the letter. You read on: "Greetings! Your application to the 'University of Mortality' has been accepted."<br><br>The letter goes on to give you instructions on the date your first semester will begin and the names of your new dorm parents. There's a catalog attached detailing information and opportunities available to you in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. The long wait is over!<br><br>With anticipation you have looked forward to this day. Your remember the time of the Grand Council in Heaven when you elected to be tested as a mortal. You have watched through the centuries, and now the Lord's instructions to his prophets ring in your ears.<br><br><i>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</i><br><br><i>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</i><br><br><i>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</i><br><br><i>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</i>[Job 38:4–7]<br><br>Now is your time to shout for joy, for now it is your turn to be on earth!<br><h2><b>Three Degrees</b></h2><br>Preparation for your birth date finds you studying the catalog over and over again. If you are accepted for graduation from the University of Mortality, it will be possible for you to receive one of three degrees--a telestial degree, terrestrial degree, or a celestial degree. The choice will be yours as to which one you will prepare yourself to obtain. The opportunities in the eternities to come depend on which degree you decide to strive for.<br><br>As you study the options, only the celestial degree offers eternal growth and opportunity and life with Father again. We read:<br><br><i>These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical.</i><br><br><i>And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fullness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.</i><br><br><i>And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differ from that of the glory of the moon in the firmament.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:70–71, 81]<br><br>The choice is clear. You will shoot for the sun, the celestial degree!<br><br>We now turn to the section in the catalog on the required courses for the celestial degree. We find there subjects that are elective and those that are required. Because we are just beginning, we want to start with the required courses. The names of these courses are most interesting. Let us consider the names and course descriptions of just a few.<br><h2><b>Self-Worth</b></h2><br>Here is an interesting one! It is entitled "Self-Worth 101." We read on in the description:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>The description states further, "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6).<br><br>From this we understand the high priority the Lord, our Eternal Father, has placed on education and our constant striving to better our situation, to improve our minds, and to learn and grow.<br><br>"True education," according to President David O. McKay, "is awakening a love for truth, a just sense of duty, opening the eyes of the soul to the great purpose and end of life" (David O. McKay, "True Education,"<i>The Instructor,</i>August 1961, p. 254). He also said, "Wisdom is the right application of knowledge to the development of a noble and Godlike character" (McKay, "True Education," p. 253).<br><br>Man's diligence and obedience are prerequisites for his obtaining this intelligence. The spiritual level of man's understanding is determined by his faithful response to God's commandments. So if his level of intelligence determines the level of his resurrection and degree of glory for which he has prepared himself, then it must follow that those who are more diligent and obedient than others in this world will obtain greater advantage in the world to come.<br><br>Gaining knowledge is one thing, and applying it is another. If a man makes "wise" decisions, he has applied his knowledge to the experience he might already have gained, to the good counsel he might have received from another, and to the core of values he possesses, coming up with intelligent thinking or a righteous application of his knowledge.<br><br>If we are to survive in our mortal experience, we must be able to apply our knowledge wisely and make intelligent decisions. We must prepare ourselves spiritually as well as intellectually. We must be part of the kingdom of God first, before we are part of anything else the world has to offer. Therein lies our strength to meet the battle head-on and come up a winner!<br><br>If we treasure our membership in God's kingdom, and if we learn by the Spirit as our teachers teach by the Spirit, no matter under what circumstances, we will shore up our defenses and be strengthened. We will be in a much better position to keep our life's priorities in proper order.<br><br>There is a danger, however, and it is a well-recognized fact that if too much emphasis is placed on the intellect, if a person learns to lean too heavily on the arm of flesh--that is, so-called "recognized authority," scientific facts, formulas, etc.--to the exclusion of spiritual knowledge and nurturing, he will lose the Spirit and begin to doubt. And if something cannot be proven absolutely according to the world's formula, he will disbelieve.<br><br>Balance is so important in our lives! We must be certain our academic learning, our intellectual knowledge, is balanced with a proportionate share of things of the Spirit. President Kimball has said:<br><br><i>This time of intellectual testing must also be a time of equivalent testing and flexing in things spiritual too. "The spirit giveth life" is so true in so many ways. When there is an inner-emptiness in the life of man, his surroundings, however affluent, cannot compensate. When there is a crisis of purpose, nothing will really seem worthwhile or meaningful. When man's relationship with God has been breached, we will be as Isaiah said, "restless as the 'sea which cannot rest!'"</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity,"<i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo, 12 September 1967), p. 2]<br><br>If we value these words of a prophet of God, if we are anxious to be obedient, and if we are striving to be like him who is the supreme example, then we will know that we must be about our Father's business. We will know that secular knowledge, though very important to us in our mortal lives, must take its proper place, and that the knowledge of God and his kingdom and eternal life with him is the very beginning and end of all we hold dear.<br><br>President Kimball then went on to use the example of Peter and Andrew, called to be disciples of Jesus. Though they would be considered ignorant and unlearned in the world today, yet they had a knowledge of that which was necessary to instill in their hearts a simple yet perfect faith. They had an understanding of what was required to reach life eternal. This was an essential requirement for their mortal experience--a commitment and dedication to the Lord to drop whatever they were doing and follow him and learn of him. This qualified them for life eternal--a celestial degree.<br><br>According to President Kimball, they will have eons of time to learn about geography, history, zoology, and mathematics in the eternities to come. "Education for eternity" is not just a catchy phrase--its consequences are eternal.<br><br>What an intriguing class! We will want to put this high on our list of courses for our celestial degree.<br><h2><b>Moral Cleanliness</b></h2><br>Here is another course of great interest: "Your Standard of Morality, Course 110." One of the great heroes we have been able to study in the Old Testament is Joseph. When he was only seventeen, his brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites, and he was carried away as a slave into Egypt. There he was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian who was an officer of the pharaoh and a captain of the guard. Even though Joseph was young and inexperienced, he made his way to being chief among all the servants in Potiphar's house. But his position was not without challenge, for Potiphar's wife liked his looks and invited him into her chambers. He refused by letting her know what his standard of morality was.<br><br>One day she found him going about his business in the house, and there was no one else around. She caught hold of his garment. Joseph literally left his garment in her hands and fled, as the scriptures record, "and got him out" (Genesis 39:12). He physically removed himself from the temptation.<br><br>Joseph would not violate the trust placed in him, nor his commitment to the Lord to follow the Lord's code of morality. He had established for himself a standard of values that were the same as the Lord's.<br><br>I have made quite a remarkable discovery lately in my study of the computer. There are at least three integral parts--input devices, a storage unit, and output equipment. Only information put into the computer and stored can be produced as output. We cannot expect something to come out that has not been properly input.<br><br>It is similar in our human mind. We have eyes and ears to see and hear as input devices. Our brain stores the information we see and hear, and makes it available to us when we need output in the form of speech, expression, or movement. It is only what we store in our mind that will be available to us to produce the output we need for life.<br><br>President Romney has said:<br><br><i>The great overall struggle in the world today is, as it has always been, for the souls of men. Every soul is personally engaged in the struggle, and he makes his fight with what is in his mind. In the final analysis the battleground is, for each individual, within himself. Inevitably he gravitates toward the subjects of his thoughts.</i>[Marion G. Romney, "The Book of Mormon,"<i>Ensign</i>, May 1980, p. 66]<br><br>Certainly the writer of Proverbs declared an eternal truth when he said: "For as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7).<br><br>Pornography, or near-pornography, is easily available to us in the world today. It degrades humanity. And once we allow our minds to become filled with it, we find that we lose power over our actions. The sexual sins of fornication and adultery seem to follow soon afterward in the lives of those who fill their minds with this filth and trash.<br><br>The value of moral cleanliness is great. It cannot be bought with gold or silver. It will do more to bring about eternal happiness than almost anything else we can do. It was Paul who counseled the Galatians when he said:<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i>[Galatians 6:7–8]<br><br>Moral cleanliness or virtue is a standard of decency that should be observed by all thinking people who want good homes, strong communities, and a great country.<br><br>The subject matter of this course will certainly determine the kind of world we want to help build, and the type that we will enjoy living in. It will help us make the decisions that will not allow us to succumb to the pressures and temptations so prevalent today. We will have the courage to keep ourselves separated from the degrading influences of life and, if necessary, will be like Joseph and remove ourselves physically from them. "And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 38:42).<br><h2><b>Being True</b></h2><br>Here is another interesting required course. It is entitled "To Thine Own Self Be True 120." This course will teach us the value of honesty--which includes honor, integrity, and truthfulness. We will study great Church leaders such as President N. Eldon Tanner, who assumed the burden and responsibilities for the financial affairs of the Church for so many years. He was noted throughout the world as a man of integrity. When President Tanner shook hands on an agreement or signed his name on a contract, everyone knew he could be trusted without question. All terms would be rigidly adhered to in an honest and fair way.<br><br>He said:<br><br><i>There is far too much immorality, dishonesty, and lack of integrity in the lives of those who are leading and guiding the affairs of our nations, our schools, and our communities. Somehow we must get back to the lofty ideals . . . of those who fought and died for truth, religion, and freedom.</i>[N. Eldon Tanner, "Remember Who You Are,"<i>Ensign</i>, January 1983, pp. 3–4]<br><br>In a similar tone, President Kimball has said:<br><br><i>Practically all dishonesty owes its existence and growth to the inward distortion we call self-justification. It is the first and worst, and most insidious and damaging form of cheating, to cheat oneself.</i>[Mexico/CA Area Conference, August 1972, p. 27]<br><br>So often in mortality, men with promising futures justify declaring themselves an unauthorized bonus, only to be discovered and have their careers destroyed. The stigma of dishonesty literally marks them for life. President Heber J. Grant said:<br><br><i>The fundamental thing for a Latter-day Saint is to be honest. The fundamental thing for a Latter-day Saint is to value his word as faithfully as his bond; to make up his mind that under no circumstances, no matter how hard it may be, by and with the help of the Lord, he will dedicate his life and his best energies to making good his promises.</i>[Heber J. Grant, "As Other Men Judge Us,"<i>Improvement Era</i>, June 1938, p. 327]<br><br>You will find those in mortality who want as much latitude as possible, as much gray area as they can find, between honesty and dishonesty. The Lord has established the standard. It is the same as the Savior taught. There is no gray area.<br><br>Brigham Young taught the pioneers:<br><br><i>We want the Saints to increase in goodness, until our mechanics, for instance, are so honest and reliable that this Railroad Company will say, "Give us a Mormon elder for an engineer, then none need have the least fear to ride, for if he knows there is danger he will take every measure necessary to preserve the lives of those entrusted to his care."</i>[<i>JD</i>12:300]<br><br>William Shakespeare wrote, "Mine honor is my life; both grow in one; Take honor from me, and my life is done" (<i>King Richard the Second,</i>act 1, sc. 1, lines 182–83).<br><br>Here is a course that will teach us to have a value standard of honesty that will be in harmony with divine law. It will build within us an integrity that will tell the world we can be trusted.<br><h2><b>Honest Labor</b></h2><br>Now here is another basic course, this one entitled "By the Sweat of His Brow 130." It appears as if in mortality we are to learn the joy of honest labor, how to produce with our heads and our hands something creative for mankind. President Kimball gave us this example of his experience as a boy.<br><br><i>As a boy I saw how all, young and old, worked and worked hard. We knew that we were taming the Arizona desert. But had I been wiser then, I would have realized that we were taming ourselves, too. Honest toil in subduing sagebrush, taming deserts, channeling rivers, helps to take the wildness out of man's environment but also out of him. The disdain for work among some today may merely signal the return of harshness and wildness--perhaps not to our landscape but to some people. The dignity and self-esteem that honest work produces are essential to happiness. It is so easy for leisure to turn into laziness.</i>[<i>TSWK</i>, p. 362]<br><br>This course will not only teach us to be productive, to work, to be busily engaged, but to not waste our time in idleness. There appears to be another virtue in this course as well, and that is not to waste the valuable resources the Lord has given us, but to preserve and protect them for the use of mankind. In fact, the Lord has told us that if we needlessly waste what he has blessed us with, he will take it away from us.<br><br>This course will teach us about the Lord's system of providing abundantly for his children, so long as we will be industrious and take care of that which he has provided.<br><br>The beehive was the pioneer emblem. Industry has always been a vital part of the heritage of our Father in Heaven's children. President Grant's words should ever ring in our ears:<br><br><i>The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership</i>. [<i>CR</i>, October 1936, p. 3]<br><br>This is a course that will teach a standard of industry that will give us a sense of accomplishment from our daily labors.<br><h2><b>A Temple of God</b></h2><br>There is another required course. It is entitled "Know Ye Not That Ye Are the Temple of God? 140."<br><br>Again there is the example of another one of the great prophets of the Old Testament, Daniel. During the period of time in which he lived, Israel was not faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord. Because of this she lost her power and was not able to defend herself against her enemies.<br><br>Strategically, she was in an awkward position. The powerful nations of Egypt and Syria bordered her on the south and on the north. Instead of doing battle on their own lands, these two nations took turns overrunning Israel and making her their battleground.<br><br>It was under these conditions that Daniel was born. When he was just a child, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem. As part of the spoils of his conquest, he took the sacred vessels from the holy temple back as trophies. Then, in order to make his nation still stronger, he took hostage all of the bright and promising Israelite children. As the scriptures record, the king took those<br><br><i>Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</i>[Daniel 1:4]<br><br>Daniel was one of those taken back to the palace as a slave by Nebuchadnezzar, to be trained in the king's way and used to help make the empire stronger.<br><br>It was not long after Daniel had been taken from his home in Jerusalem that he faced his first real test. The young men of Israel had been apportioned a daily provision of the king's food, consisting of meat and wine.<br><br>Daniel knew in his heart, because of the training of his parents, that the food and the wine provided by the king would not be good for him. He knew it would defile his body. So he went to the prince who was over them and pleaded with him that he not be required to eat the meat and drink the wine of the king. The prince was astonished at this request. He did not dare allow Daniel the privilege of eating anything other than that the king had ordered. He was afraid he would lose his position, or perhaps, even his life, if the king found out. Daniel understood this, but he had been taught correct principles. He bargained with the prince this way: He would eat only the foods he had been taught were good for him for just ten days. If after ten days his countenance was not fairer and healthier than all the rest, he would then eat the king's portion of meat and drink the wine.<br><br>Of course, because Daniel followed the Lord's way, at the end of the tenth day he was the strongest of all those taken before the king.<br><br>You have been taught that your body is a temple of God, and you are to treat it as such. Sometimes you may be ridiculed and laughed at for refusing to partake of those things that will destroy your body. We challenge you to remember that just as Daniel of old received strength by obeying the Lord's commandments, you will too, and will be blessed in the same way.<br><h2><b>Completing Your Degree</b></h2><br>The Lord's laws are eternal. Just as sure as we follow them, we will receive his blessings. For he has promised us that<br><br><i>All saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health . . . ;</i><br><br><i>. . . wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18–20]<br><br>Thumbing through the catalog beyond the basic required courses that begin with 100, we find an overwhelming selection of courses with numbers 200, 300, 400, 500, etc. The University of Mortality is going to offer us an abundance of electives to bring beauty into life and opportunities to improve talents. There will be courses offered in helping us improve our application for the cultural arts, music, paintings, dance, and drama. There is a large section on career choices that will give us variety in the work-a-day world. Yes, and there is even one section on the characteristics to look for in our selection of an eternal companion, the most important choice we will make while attending the University of Mortality.<br><br>Of course, no university experience could be complete without periods of examination to test our progress toward the degree of our choice. A pattern of earthly ordinances has been established. The completion of these ordinances is required to qualify us for the highest degree offered. Before being allowed to participate in an ordinance, we will be required to sit in front of a priesthood leader and be tested on our faith, testimony, and obedience to gospel principles. A true record of our responses will be made and will become a permanent part of our requirements for graduation. A record will be made of the integrity of our responses to a priesthood leader before passing the test of having the ordinances of baptism, confirmation, gifts of the priesthood, and those ordinances performed in the holy temples.<br><br>The honest completion of each one entitles us to move forward on the next step toward our celestial degree. The failure to pass any one of the required tests will, of necessity, reduce us to a lower, less-wanted degree. However, the university does recognize the possibility of failure in an examination. There is a process of repentance, correction, and the opportunity again of redirecting our course toward the highest objective. Make-up tests will be allowed. There is, of course, the resulting sorrow that comes from failure, the recognition that extra effort must be exerted to make up for lost time, and the struggle and need for a new determination to get us back on course.<br><h2><b>Here and Now</b></h2><br>It is now 1988. You are presently enrolled in the University of Mortality, having arrived here without knowledge of the decisions you made in the premortal existence. In fact, you find yourself enrolled in one of the most exciting, challenging semesters of your entire earthly experience. It is the semester when many of the most important decisions in mortality must be made. The balance of your life here and in the eternities to come will depend on the decisions you make now. Your future happiness depends on these decisions. They are, of course, educational goals, career paths, talent enhancement, marriage, and the degree you want to obtain in this life to wear gloriously and proudly in the eternities to come.<br><br>We challenge you to study and internalize the basic required courses for life with the promise that conducting yourself in harmony with the Lord's law will bring the only true, fulfilling, and rewarding happiness that this experience in the University of Mortality can produce.<br><br>Our Eternal Father stands ready to bless you. He will not forsake you, so long as you do not forsake him. Even then, he is willing to extend a helping hand to those who honestly and sincerely repent and strive to do the works of righteousness.<br><br>May God bless you with the strength of spirit to choose wisely the values by which you will govern your life, and may he bless you with the courage and commitment to stand steadfast in keeping the commandments of the Lord. This is my prayer, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>the Gospel Simple - Glen L. Rudd - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Many years ago I went on a mission to New Zealand, and the day I arrived I had the opportunity of meeting President Matthew Cowley for the first time. He was to be my mission president. During the next two years we became close friends, and during the latter part of my mission I had the honor of living in the mission home with the Cowleys and traveling with President Cowley throughout New Zealand.<br><br>He was an excellent teacher and a most interesting person. Some years later, while he was a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, I had the opportunity of bringing him here to BYU on two or three occasions when he was the speaker at devotionals. Everyone loved to hear him and his stories. Even though he has been gone for over thirty-four years, there are people in many parts of the Church still interested in the faith-promoting stories he used to tell. As I have prepared to come here today, I have been reminded over and over of the inspirational talks he gave to the students who were here. Those students might have been your parents--and for some, even your grandparents.<br><br>Over and above everything else, President Cowley tried to keep simple the things he taught. In fact, he said many times that he was unable to speak very often of things beyond the first principles of the gospel. I remember well that he spoke about prayer, faith, and repentance. For several years he had a talk ready on baptism, but he was never able to get that far along and give it. He had some ideas on baptism that he wanted to give in general conference, but life ran out before he gave his special talk on baptism. He lived simply. He really didn't concern himself with his own personal needs. He only wanted to bless people and inspire them to live the gospel in a simple way.<br><br>Because of his great faith, many wonderful things continued to happen after our missions were over. We found ourselves blessing people all over who called for him. I was a very young bishop in those days who had a rather difficult time earning a living because President Cowley would insist I leave work and go with him. After we would bless people, he would fast and pray for them and return again and again to those who needed him. We saw great miracles happen in those days. My testimony to you students is that miracles do happen! They are happening on the earth today, and they will continue to happen, particularly to those who believe and have great faith. Miracles occur frequently in the lives of humble, fine Saints who have the faith to make them possible. My feeling about miracles is that the greatest of all miracles is the one that happens in the life of a person who really learns how to pray, who exercises faith to repent, and who lives the gospel in a simple and obedient way.<br><br>President Matthew Cowley said many times, "The gospel of Jesus Christ is simply beautiful and beautifully simple." He spent his whole life trying to explain that there isn't anything very complicated about the Church. In fact, most of the Church leaders whom I have known have taught the same thing. Many of us complicate simple things to the point of causing confusion. The Savior has always been direct and plain in giving commandments to us. I am convinced that understanding increases when we talk or teach in a direct and simple way. For instance, we are told to do missionary work by the Spirit. We could complicate this by writing books on how to follow the Spirit in missionary work, but that is really unnecessary because the Lord has a manner of communicating with us in a very simple way. Generally, all that a person has to do is pray in faith and wait for the answer. Sometimes he needs to do a little more than just wait, but the more simple he can keep his prayers, the more simple and more direct the answer will be.<br><br>Now, let me say a little more about Matthew Cowley. He was a very uncomplicated man. Some who couldn't understand his simplicity became confused about the things he was able to do and found it difficult to understand him. I had the opportunity of being his close associate for fifteen years. After he died, some people asked me to explain Matthew Cowley to them. One man in a high position said, "I just can't understand how he did all the things he did." The real answer was that he went directly to the Lord, told the Lord what he wanted, and received the answer. There wasn't anything hard about that. He just did it.<br><br>President Cowley was different from mission presidents today. Mission presidents in this day and age are well-organized in order to hold district and zone meetings and all the necessary appointments and interviews. They have almost every day planned weeks in advance. Brother Cowley never planned anything. He just lived by the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>As his traveling companion in the mission field, I received instructions from him to keep my briefcase packed with a couple of clean shirts, clean socks, and clean underwear. Then he said, "When I say, 'We're going,' you grab your bag, beat me to the car, and don't ask any questions." When that would happen, I would grab my bag and go to the car. Being a young, eager missionary, I would wonder, "Where are we going now?" But I didn't ask.<br><br>Once, after we had driven a few miles, he asked, "Would you like to know where we're going?" I said, "Yes." Then he said, "So would I! I'm not sure just where we're going, but we'll keep going. And when the Lord tells us to turn, we'll turn, and we'll end up where he wants us to be."<br><br>The Maori people used to pray for President Cowley to come to them. One day he drove up to the front of a post office in a rather distant city in New Zealand. There were two sisters standing by the post office waiting. When he got out of the car, one said to the other, "See, I told you he would be here soon." President Cowley said, "Hey, what's going on here?" One of the sisters said, "We needed you and we've been praying. We knew you would be coming, and you always go directly to the post office, so we decided to wait here until you arrived." It was just that simple. People would tell the Lord what they wanted, and somehow or other President Cowley was led by the Spirit to go where they were. Now, he wasn't totally disorganized, but I have never known anyone who planned less and accomplished more, simply by doing the things he felt impressed to do.<br><br>During the last several months, while I have been speaking at stake conferences, I have had difficulty myself getting past the simple principles of personal and family prayer, faith, and repentance. I believe in these things. I think they are as plain and simple as anything in the whole world can possibly be. I am going to tell you four simple stories about<i>prayer, faith, repentance, and baptism.</i><br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>Prayer is the way we talk to the Lord. We bow before him and in humble prayer pour out the feelings of our hearts, thank him, and ask him for special blessings. If we have simple faith, those answers will come.<br><br>Just to illustrate this, one day when President Cowley and I were traveling, we arrived at the home of Brother Stewart Meha, a great and wonderful Maori man. He was in every way a pure patriarch. He had never been ordained a patriarch--he just was one, and he presided over his large family as a true father and leader. President Cowley and Brother Meha spent all afternoon sitting on the porch just talking about the Church and other interesting things. I listened to them part of the time and then visited with the kids and others who lived in this little area near Brother Meha's home. Incidentally, there were two or three other homes in this little Maori village, but I discovered that most of the people living there belonged to his family. They were his children and his grandchildren.<br><br>When it came time for the evening meal, Brother Meha stood on his front porch and, in the Maori language, shouted out to all of his large family, "Haere Mai Ki Te Kai." Then he said, "Haere Mai Ki Te Karakia." This simply meant "Come on home for supper" and "Come on home for prayer." Soon family members came from every direction. We all assembled in his home in the big front room. This room had very little furniture in it, and everybody gathered in a large circle. Brother Meha was at the head of the circle and on his left was President Cowley. I was next to the president. On Brother Meha's right was a little child about eight years of age. All around the rest of the circle were the other children with some adults in between.<br><br>Finally Brother Meha said to the little boy on his right, "You start." I bowed my head in anticipation of the little boy's prayer. Instead of praying, he quoted a scripture, after first reciting the chapter and verse. Then the young person next to him gave a scripture with the reference. After about four scriptures had been given, I realized that we were going around the circle with each person quoting a different passage of scripture. One youngster started to quote one that had already been used, and he was quickly corrected. I immediately began to think of a scripture that I could quote when my turn came.<br><br>I had been in the mission field just a little over a year and had mastered two wonderful passages of scripture. I mentally polished up my first scripture and had no sooner silently rehearsed it than one of the young people gave that exact scripture. This, of course, slowed me down for a minute, but I thought I was okay because I still had one in reserve. I worked a little on it, only to hear someone directly across from me quote it. I then became panicky as I realized I could not think of another scripture I could give. My turn was coming closer and closer, and I felt tension building up within me. My mind went totally blank.<br><br>In my moment of greatest concern, President Cowley nudged me with his elbow and, out of the side of his mouth, said, "Quick--tell me a scripture. I can't think of a single one to say." I then realized that the two of us were in the same desperate situation. At that moment it was my turn. I bravely said the first article of faith. President Cowley followed by quoting the second article of faith, and then Brother Meha prayed. I think that night he prayed for the mission president and the missionaries a little more than usual. When the prayer was finished, a little boy about eight years of age came over to us and said, "I guess you two guys don't know that the Articles of Faith are not allowed in our scripture study."<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, that was an excellent example to me of family prayer and how children can be taught the scriptures. If we would just gather together and have prayer, it would probably be the finest teaching experience that a mother and father could give to their children. Prayers do not need to be long or complicated. They only need to be simple and sincere. If we want to talk to the Lord, we do it through prayer. If we listen with faith, we will hear his answers. We can also search the scriptures, for in the scriptures we are given in an uncomplicated way the answers to the things we need to know. Prayer is simple and should remain that way.<br><h2><b>Faith</b></h2><br>Now let me say something to you about faith. Faith is the first principle of the gospel. Faith is a gift from our Heavenly Father. No one seems to have enough faith. It is hard to tell how much we have, but we all need a little bit more. The faith of most of us seems to come and go. Faith is simply knowing that the Lord is there and that he will keep his promises to those who humbly approach him.<br><br>Let me tell you an unusual experience that happened to me personally while I was presiding over the old Florida mission about twenty years ago. It all started when I received a letter written in Spanish. Upon reading the translated letter, I learned it was from a young member of the Church--a sister twenty or twenty-one years of age, Flavia Salazar Gomez--who was living in the city of Santiago in the Dominican Republic. I understood that Santiago at that time had close to 200,000 inhabitants. It is located about ninety miles north of Santo Domingo, which is the main city in that country.<br><br>Flavia stated in her letter that she had joined the Church when she as about twelve. Her sisters and mother had also joined the Church, and she had been very active in Mexico. Later on, she had fallen in love with a Dominican boy, married him, and gone with him to the Dominican Republic to live. Flavia thought she was the only Latter-day Saint in the whole country of five million people. She mentioned in her letter that she had a year-old baby boy who had not been named or blessed by the priesthood. She wrote that she was seriously ill with cancer and had been told by doctors that she did not have very long to live. She asked if it would be possible for someone holding the priesthood to come to Santiago and give her a blessing.<br><br>I wrote her back and told her we would get there as soon as possible. It wasn't long before I was to go to a district conference in Puerto Rico. There was one Latter-day Saint family living in Santo Domingo--Brother and Sister Dale Valentine and their children. Brother Valentine was an elder, and they were a good, active, fine Latter-day Saint family. I wrote Brother Valentine and asked if he would take me to Santiago so we could find and bless Flavia.<br><br>I took Elder Gert Forestor with me and flew into the Dominican Republic. Brother Valentine and one of his children met us at the airport in Santo Domingo, and early the next morning all four of us got into his station wagon and drove up to the city of Santiago. It was a rather long ride because the highway was crooked and traffic was quite heavy.<br><br>When we arrived at the outskirts of Santiago, Brother Valentine asked me where she lived. At that moment we realized that none of us knew exactly where she lived. We didn't have a street address for her. All I knew was her name and that she was hoping we would come. We stopped the car for a few minutes on a high point overlooking the city. I told Brother Valentine to drive his car down into the city and turn left. He obediently drove on. I then told him to make a right turn and proceed toward the center of this large, congested city. As we drove down this busy street, we began looking for a parking place. But there was none to be found. After traveling several more blocks, Brother Valentine said, "What can we possibly do to find her?" I said, "Go to the next corner, make a right turn, and after you turn you will find an empty parking place."<br><br>He drove to the corner and made the right turn. There in front of us in the second or third slot was an open place where he parked the car. We got out of the car and stood on the sidewalk. He said, "Now what do we do?" I said, "Let's just start asking people." Brother Valentine just looked at me as if I had lost all my marbles. I wasn't sure myself, but I had a feeling we were okay.<br><br>There was a man on the sidewalk leaning up against the front of a residence. Brother Valentine went over to him, spoke in Spanish, and asked if he knew Flavia Salazar Gomez. The man looked at him in surprise and said, "Yes, she's my wife. She's just inside that door." We had parked in front of their home.<br><br>Her husband went in, and she came out onto the sidewalk with her little baby boy. We were pleased to see what a lovely person she was. We were invited into their humble little home. I asked Brother Valentine to interview her and see how close to the Church she had remained. We were delighted to know that she was still living the Word of Wisdom and that she prayed every day. Of course, she had no church to attend and was unable to make any contributions to the Church, but she felt she was a good, faithful member. She asked if President David O. McKay was still alive and well and asked a few other questions about the Church. It had been at least two years since she had left Mexico, and during that time she had been out of contact with the Church. We named and blessed the little boy, and then I requested Brother Valentine give her a blessing in Spanish. I felt impressed to tell him to bless her that she would recover from her cancerous condition and become well. After the blessing and a brief visit, we drove back to the city of Santo Domingo.<br><br>A month or two later, I heard from Brother Valentine that Flavia and her husband had moved into Santo Domingo. Six months later, as I was on my way to Puerto Rico again, I stopped over in Santo Domingo, and Brother Valentine drove me out to where Flavia and her husband were living. We found her in good health, looking well and happy. She told us she had been completely cured. The doctors told her she no longer had cancer, and it seemed she was going to be all right from then on. They were delighted to see us again. It was a great thrill to meet this lovely Latter-day Saint sister and realize the blessings of the Lord that had come to her.<br><br>Actually, what happened was that this lovely, young Mexican mother needed a priesthood blessing. She knew there was no way to get one except to ask the Lord to help her. She very simply wrote a letter to the mission president, who she didn't know. The mission president read her letter and immediately did the thing that the Lord told him to do. He arranged to go and answer her need. It was just that simple. There may be those who question such things as this, but they happen all the time. Almost any priesthood leader, if he thinks for a moment, can tell you how faith has led him to do things that he hadn't planned to do.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>Repentance is just about as simple as prayer and faith. All that a person really has to do to repent is to quit doing what is wrong and then make amends as much as he can to rectify the problems he has created. Then he must tell the Lord about it, and sometimes he needs to tell the bishop or the branch president, but it can all be handled in a simple, practical way. Repentance is understood by some people to be a long, drawn-out process. That is absolutely not necessary. We just quit doing what is wrong, make up for it in the best possible way, and let the Lord do his part. He has promised that when a man repents, he is forgiven. If he does not commit the wrong again, the Lord will not even remember it. Let me read from section 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 42 and 43:<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i><br><br>Nothing is more direct or simple than that scripture.<br><br>Now, let me tell you an interesting story about repentance. There was a man by the name of Syd who lived in a little Maori village on the east coast of New Zealand. At that time a large branch of the Church was there with about 400 members. One Saturday afternoon after a long, eight-hour drive, President Cowley arrived at this village and went directly to see his old friend Syd. As a young man, Syd had been an outstanding athlete. Some missionaries had taken him to America, where he attended high school and some college. He became a well-known basketball player and, as an all-star athlete, he received a lot of publicity. His picture was in the papers many times, and everybody knew about this fine athlete from New Zealand. He was ordained a seventy while he lived here, but when he went back to New Zealand he found he was the only seventy in the whole country. He didn't have a quorum to belong to, and he became somewhat inactive. The first thing he knew, he was tampering with the Word of Wisdom and was in the habit of taking it easy. But deep within his heart he still knew the gospel to be true.<br><br>Now, as mission president and as friend, President Cowley called on Syd. Let me explain that among the Maori members and the missionaries, President Cowley was known as "Tumuaki," a word of utmost respect meaning "president" or "beloved leader" in the Maori language. "Tumuaki" found Syd sitting in a rocking chair on his front porch smoking a big cigar. He didn't stop chewing on his cigar as President Cowley sat beside him to visit. After they had talked and laughed for a while, President Cowley became serious and said, "Syd, I want you to come to church tomorrow."<br><br>They both looked toward the old chapel that was nearby, and Syd said, "I think it would fall in! I haven't been there for a long time. I don't think I'd better risk it."<br><br>President Cowley said, "Syd, I want you to be there. I'm going to do something important tomorrow."<br><br>Syd inquired, "What are you going to do?"<br><br>President Cowley answered, "I'm going to release the branch president and put in a new one."<br><br>Syd said, "Why don't you just tell me who the new branch president will be, and then I won't have to get myself cleaned up for church in the morning."<br><br>President Cowley said, "Well, I'll tell you who it is. It's going to be you."<br><br>Syd had that old cigar in his mouth. He pulled it out and looked at it and said, "Tumuaki, you mean me and my cigar?"<br><br>President Cowley said, "No, Syd--just you. We don't need your cigar."<br><br>Then Syd threw the cigar out on the ground in front of the porch. He thought for a moment, turned to President Cowley, and very humbly said, "Tumuaki, I don't break the Word of Wisdom anymore. I'm a full-tithe payer. I'll be the branch president, and I'll be worthy. Tomorrow morning I'll be there, and I promise you that I'll be the best branch president in the whole country. You won't have to worry about me and whether or not I'm living the gospel."<br><br>For the next several years, Syd served as one of the strongest and finest leaders in New Zealand. His son became the first bishop in the ward when the stake was created, and his grandson was just recently released as bishop. His whole family is strong and active in the Church today and is one of the great families in New Zealand. Why? Because old Syd knew how to repent. He repented on the spot. When he was called to repentance, he quit his worldly ways. He became and remained a faithful Saint until the day he died.<br><br>Now, that's all there is to repentance. You see how simple that really was? President Cowley never did ask Syd to repent. He gave him an opportunity to be of service to the Church. He gave him a priesthood calling. Syd knew he could no longer sin, so he immediately quit. It was over--just like that! The Lord accepted his repentance, and Syd became a great leader.<br><h2><b>Baptism</b></h2><br>Now, baptism and confirmation are just as simple as prayer and faith and repentance. Baptism is simply doing what the Savior has told us to do. Go before the priesthood, be baptized by immersion, and receive the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands. These ordinances do not need to be complicated.<br><br>I don't have time to tell you much about baptism except to tell you that it has to be done exactly right. There was an interesting old Maori man in New Zealand who loved to baptize people. In fact, as he grew older he did a most unusual thing. He would go down to the ocean, gather up all the kids who were playing on the beach, and take them out in the water one by one and baptize them. This is<i>not</i>the way we do baptisms in the Church! None of the kids was ever confirmed and nothing ever came of his baptisms, but all the missionaries knew him and loved him. They called him "Cannonball." He was a funny old Maori man who had a great heart and loved the Lord. The elders finally got him to quit baptizing.<br><br>My whole purpose in telling you these stories today is to bear testimony to you that simplicity is possible. Almost every principle and every doctrine of the Church can be made simple if we make the effort. It is absolutely possible to live righteously and properly in a simple way.<br><br>The Lord knows how to hear our prayers--so pray!<br><br>The Lord knows how to give us faith--so ask him for faith!<br><br>The Lord knows how to help us repent--so repent as needed!<br><br>In the most simple way I know, I bear to you my humble witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and the head of this church. Today a great man stands before us as our president. He is a living prophet of the Lord. May we all sustain him, support him, and be the kind of followers of Christ that we ought to be. This I humbly pray, and I leave my blessings upon each and every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Glen L.

<h1>Worthy You - Philip T. Sonntag - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm honored to be invited to participate at this special time, to view this great and vast audience, and to feel the impact that is possible in the world because of your lives. Your life is sacredly yours. It has never been lived before and no one else can ever live it. Only you can set the bounds. You have the capacity to determine exactly what you are to become.<br><h2><b>What Life Is All About</b></h2><br>Many of us focus our existence on earning--on acquiring, spending, and consuming. We use up our time getting things and then maintaining them, finding a place to store them, fixing them up when they break, guarding them against theft, and then upgrading them when a newer model comes out. When I think of accumulating things and the difference it makes, I think of the experience I had in Bacolod, on the Negros Island in the Philippines.<br><br>We were being driven to stake conference by President Ruiz. He had borrowed a car so we would have transportation. When we drove up to the little chapel there in Bacolod, there was no one around. I said, "President, maybe the conference is at another time." He replied, "No, they're all inside." We drove into the parking lot--ours was the only car there. We got out of the car and walked into the chapel. It was packed to capacity and people were standing on the sides. The meeting commenced and the great stake president, President Villerette, stood. He looked at his people and tears began to stream down his face. He said, "I'm hungry. My wife and my children are hungry. All we have to eat is a little bowl of rice each day." Then he said, "But you, my brothers and sisters, are hungry, too. And I promise you that if you will live and keep the commandments of the Lord that this will pass, and one day again we will have our stomachs full and be able to enjoy the blessings of our country."<br><br>Our success at business, sports, friendship, love, and life--nearly every enterprise we attempt--is largely determined by our own self-image. People who have confidence in their personal worth seem to be magnets for success and happiness. When I think of happiness, I think of an experience we had in Tarawa. We were traveling to Tarawa, and as the plane landed and pulled up to the very humble terminal, the door opened, and a man jumped in, saying, "Elder Sonntag, please come quickly." We did not know what the urgency was, but we came quickly out of the airplane, walked right through Immigration (they knew we weren't going anywhere else), and then walked over to two vans. There was a tarp spread between the two vans, and sitting on the tarp were nineteen young men and women. We were informed that they were missionaries--young people from the islands that dot the sea, islands that really have not even been given names. They were young people who had come to Tarawa to try and get an education, to learn how to read and write. While they were there they felt the spirit of the gospel and joined the Church. Now they wanted to go on missions. But as they sat there under that equatorial sun, huddled close together looking at that airplane that they never dreamed they'd have the experience of getting on, they were frightened. They asked for a special blessing. And we had the privilege of giving them that blessing--the Lord was good to us that day. We gave them that blessing, and then they arose and climbed the steps to the airplane.<br><br>Their feet had never had a pair of shoes on them. They had only one white shirt each and the clothes on their backs with just a little sack of personal belongings as they entered that airplane. They had never eaten with a fork or a spoon or a knife. They'd only eaten with their fingers. They didn't know what a cup was. They had drunk from a half shell of a coconut all their lives. And yet here they were going to be the very first missionaries in the history of the Church to leave the island of Tarawa and go to New Zealand to the Missionary Training Center. They were the first of their young people to ever have the privilege of going to the temple to receive their endowments.<br><br>We could hardly wait until we got home so we could call President Palmer at the New Zealand MTC and find out how our Tarawan missionaries were--they were just like little scared mice.<br><br>When we talked with President Palmer on the phone, he said, "Oh, President, what a great experience it was. When they came in they saw their first neon sign. They saw their first big bus. They saw their first high rise. They looked at the boats in the harbor at Auckland and were just amazed at the types of ships they saw. Everything they did was a new experience. We hardly had enough water supply because every time we went by a tap they'd turn it on to see running water. They would flush every toilet they went by. They couldn't believe what was taking place."<br><br>"But," he continued, "when they came into the classes they again huddled into the corners."<br><br>And then he said, "On the fourth day we took them to the temple. They walked in petrified and unknowing. We had prepared them as best we could. But, President, when they left the temple of the Lord they came out as giants of the Lord. And you cannot believe the difference that took place. And I want you to know that we have nineteen young people who are now worthy to represent the Savior."<br><br>Maybe we ought to take a look at what life is all about. Perhaps we should be like the man who said he had more than Carnegie or Rockefeller. "How is that?" asked a friend. "Because I have all that I need, and they always kept wanting more."<br><br>Let us learn to simplify our wants and then our lives, throwing open the windows of our souls and letting a clean, sweet breeze flow through. Let us learn to evaluate what we think we need under stricter guidelines. You might ask the questions: Will this really enhance my life? Is it worth the financial tension it will cause? Can I do without it? None of us really wants to spend our hours primarily on things that will yellow with age and break down or end up in the city dump. We pass this way only once, and there are many finer things to do.<br><br>You can follow the crowd and be one of the crowd and follow the mainstream of life--or you can be somebody. You may criticize the past and the present, and you may wonder why things are as they are. Or you may marvel at what has been accomplished in medicine, electronics, industry, farming, and education. As you evaluate your thoughts, make sure that in this life you will contribute to the world as much as those of the past have done.<br><h2><b>Be Ready and Be Yourself</b></h2><br>Our responsibility is to take the talents we have and parlay them into the highest possible achievement. Opportunities abound on every side for those who are willing to put forth the effort. Each opportunity presents a challenge. Nothing is accomplished without dedication and preparation and the will to win.<br><br>I remember the story of a young man who went out for quarterback on a football team. He was the third-string quarterback. He was at every practice. He suited up for every game. But at the games it seemed the coach forgot who he was--he didn't get to play at all during the season. He was on a good team, though, and they were playing for the championship. He said to himself, "Well, this is great. I've got the best seat in the house." And so he went out and put on his uniform, did the exercises, and felt very comfortable. When it came game time he found his place on the bench. He got a nice warm blanket, wrapped himself in it, and even called the hot dog-boy over and had a hot dog. He took his shoes off. It would be lots more comfortable watching the ball game without his cleats on. And so he sat there in that condition. The first-string quarterback didn't move the team very well. The coach brought out the second-string quarterback, but he was having a worse time. Then, out of the sounds of the stadium, there came this young man's name. He jumped off the bench and ran onto the field in his white socks. The whole stadium had their eyes glued on those white socks and wondered what the coach was doing. Of course, the play was a disaster. Time-out was called, and this young man ran off the field to put on his shoes. But the call didn't come again. He had had his chance. Life does not give too many chances. You really have to be ready when your time comes. Don't be caught with your shoes off when your chance comes.<br><br>You make a wonderful you. Don't try to be somebody else. Learn the power of proper decisions and do what you know is right. Have the ability to say no when things are not as they should be. Remember, what you do really counts.<br><br>One day I had the privilege of playing golf with President N. Eldon Tanner and his brother-in-law and nephew. We were standing on the first tee at Bonneville Golf Course. Young Wayne Moore, the nephew, didn't hesitate to ask President Tanner any questions. You know, sometimes it seems difficult to approach a General Authority and ask him a question. But it's so easy. Wayne said, "Uncle Eldon, when President Joseph Fielding Smith called you to be his counselor, did he give you any instructions?" President Tanner took a couple of practice swings with his club and then said, "No, Wayne, I don't think he gave me any instructions. His only lesson was this: If it's wrong, don't do it." There is a whole sermon preached in that little word<i>do</i>. It's a great guide in the process of our lives.<br><br>No habit chips away at our self-confidence quite so effectively as that of comparing ourselves with the people around us. When we find somebody who is indeed smarter, better looking, or funnier, it diminishes our sense of self-worth. A rabbi was asked on his deathbed what he thought the kingdom of God would be like. "I don't know," he replied. "But one thing I do know. When I get there I'm not going to be asked, 'Why weren't you like Moses? Why weren't you like David?' I'm only going to be asked one question: 'Why weren't you you?'"<br><br>There is nothing so common as unsucessful people with talent. Usually the problem lies not in<i>discovering</i>your natural aptitude but in<i>devleoping</i>it. Sometimes in the process of our lives we think the little decisions we make are not important. But what you do at any time in your life is important.<br><br>I think of Judge Ginsburg, who had the opportunity of being appointed to one of the highest offices in the country--one that would bring fame and fortune, dignity and prestige to him and his family. He would be recorded in the history books of the world. And yet in college he made some bad decisions. He decided he would go along with the crowd. And so, as the river drifted and he tried and experienced and experimented with things forbidden by God and man, he changed his course in history.<br><br>Some people are as reliable as the sunrise. You can see it in their smile and feel it in their handshake. You can tell their life is fulfilling and their work is rewarding. Happiness is something they have created for themselves with a vision of what is possible and the ability to do what is achievable. They have attained real self-worth.<br><br>When we decide to give of ourselves, then life is filled with joy. The feeling of service becomes paramount in our lives. Don't complicate things. Simplify things and show forth love. So often we are like the man with his feet in the ice bucket and his head in the oven who says, "On the average I'm doing okay." Don't influence a life unless it's for good. Be excited about life. Remember, it doesn't take a muscle spasm to show a little enthusiasm.<br><h2><b>Learn to Give</b></h2><br>There is a challenge in decision making. I'd like to tell you a story about what happened when I was a young man in a priesthood class. There were twelve of us in this class. And we were a real challenge to a teacher--as a matter of fact, to many teachers. We had a different one about every three weeks. In the process of this the bishop said, "C. N., here's your challenge." C. N. Christensen, a wise old man, walked into this class of twelve boys who were filled with energy, loved to play ball, and liked to do all of the things that made life exciting and fun. He sat down that first priesthood class and tried to teach us how to wiggle our ears. That was about the best priesthood lesson I'd had for a long time. The next week he taught us how to make faces by throwing the sides of our mouth down and up. We didn't realize what he was doing, but we were very much impressed.<br><br>One Sunday, he said to us, "I'd like to show you a trick."<br><br>We said, "Okay."<br><br>He said, "I want you to hold out your left hand. Now, take your right hand and put your little finger by it over like that and then hook your next finger. Then bring your middle finger and put it on your thumb. Move your fingers back and forth and hit the palm of your hand with the finger of your right hand."<br><br>We said, "Well, that's great."<br><br>Now he had accomplished two things. He not only kept our hands busy, but our minds' attention was on them.<br><br>Then he said, "Now what have you got?"<br><br>We said, "Two little boys chopping wood and one picking it up."<br><br>"Well," he said, "whenever I ask you to chop wood I want your full attention."<br><br>So we mastered putting our hands together. I can do it so fast now. If I asked President Holland to do that it would take him about an hour. Nevertheless, we mastered that. And then he said, "I want your attention when I say let's chop wood." And so this great leader said, "Let's chop wood." Then he would say, "God lives! Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the World! Joseph Smith was a prophet of God!" Our attention span was about that long. About four times every priesthood class he would bear that testimony to us.<br><br>And then one day he said, "I'd like to issue you a challenge. There are twelve boys sitting in this class. If all twelve of you reach the age of nineteen and are worthy to go on a mission, I'll give each one of you a thousand dollars." We thought this was the best deal we'd ever heard of. Back then you could buy a new Ford convertible for $999. So we said, "You're on."<br><br>All through the twelve-, thirteen-, and fourteen-year-old age group when someone wasn't in church, two of us were dispatched to bring him physically back. Fourteen, fifteen, and then sixteen years old, and all twelve boys were active. At seventeen, all boys were active. I'll never forget standing out in front of the old First Ward--twelve boys around the now weathered, snow-on-top-of-his-head C. N. Christensen. He was looking at these boys, and we all kept saying, "Are you saving your dough? You know we're gonna take it!"<br><br>All of a sudden tears started to roll down his cheeks; we figured we'd pushed him a little too far. We had a little more sense by then. But he said, "Oh, these are tears of joy. The happiest day of my life will be if all twelve of you boys are worthy to go on missions when you're nineteen."<br><br>When we were eighteen years of age, two boys moved to Ogden. Can you imagine the talking-to they got when they had to move to Ogden? They said, "Don't worry about us." They came from homes where parents were not active. They went to Ogden, they went to church, and they were ignored. They went for a couple of months and they still didn't have any attention. The kids wouldn't even speak to them in school. They were from Salt Lake City, and Ogden people didn't like Salt Lake City people. As a result, they found other friends, and those friends took them out of the Church.<br><br>One day the two boys that had moved were walking down a street in Salt Lake City, one with a cigarette in his hand. My buddy and I saw them. And we saw a pigeon fly up; it seemed to us he was carrying away a thousand dollar bill in his beak.<br><br>Look what was accomplished by this great man because he gave of himself. He changed the lives of ten wonderful boys who made great contributions to the Church--the Church legal counsel, stake presidents, Regional Representatives, and bishops. Ten married in the temple and served on missions. What a great tribute and blessing it was because one man learned to give.<br><br>We're to live our lives line upon line, precept upon precept. We can't be everything and do everything all at once. Know where it is that you want to go and then go forth with a vision of what you can become. There will be many mountains you'll have to climb, young people. Life's mountains are much easier to climb when you've got somebody to climb with you. But remember, each must climb his own mountain. It doesn't matter what your grandfather or your father has accomplished. You still must do your own thing. Have confidence in yourself. Say to yourself, "I'm a winner." I like men who build their world around confidence and integrity.<br><br>Build a world around you. Reach out and give of yourself. Reach out to lift others up. Your influence may be the difference that makes life worthwhile to someone. Keep yourself clean in mind and body and then your influence will be a strength to all you associate with. Most important, you'll be in tune with the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>We can't be everything to everybody. But there's something we can do and take with us, and it is more important than all the gold and property that we might amass in our lifetime. That something is character. Character is so important that it affects our entire future existence--in fact, it affects all eternity. Our character--that is what will be judged in the last day--will determine whether we will go to the celestial kingdom. To attain that highest degree, we must be Christlike. We must learn to know where we are going and how to get there. Then we must have the determination to put forth the effort whereby we can accomplish that which we desire.<br><h2><b>Make a Commitment</b></h2><br>I remember a story of what took place in Kezar Stadium in San Francisco at a professional football game between the San Francisco Forty-Niners and the Cleveland Browns. On the field was the great all-American, all-pro Jimmy Brown. He was running back for the Cleveland Browns.<br><br>Outside the stadium was another person. He was only ten years old. In fact, he'd been raised in the ghettos of San Francisco and was so undernourished that he had developed rickets. His bone structure was so weak that he needed braces simply to hold him up. His legs were beginning to bow. He didn't have the money to get into the football game, so he waited until after the third quarter, when the guards left the gates, and then walked into the stadium. He didn't walk in to watch the football game. He walked into the player's tunnel. The young man waited until the final guns sounded.<br><br>As Jimmy Brown came off the field, muddy, bloody, tired, sweaty, ready for the shower, the young boy stepped in front of him. He said, "Mr. Brown, can I have your autograph?"<br><br>Jimmy Brown, the great hero that he was, signed his name, just as he had done so many times before. He started to go. The boy grabbed hold of the jersey of number 32.<br><br>He said, "I'm not through with you yet." When Jimmy Brown turned around, the boy brought himself to attention and said, "Mr. Brown, I want you to know that I watch you on television every chance that I get. I've got your poster in my room, and I know all the great records you hold. I think you're the greatest player in professional football."<br><br>The ten-year-old boy had been practicing that speech almost in his sleep. Jimmy Brown, caught up with his enthusiasm, looked him in the eye and said, "Well, thank you very much. I appreciate that." He turned again and headed for the shower.<br><br>But the boy grabbed his jersey again and said, "I'm not through with you yet."<br><br>"Yes?" he said, "What is it now?"<br><br>The young man stretched himself as tall as he could. He looked up and said, "Mr. Brown, I want you to know one other thing. I'm going to break every record you hold."<br><br>Jimmy Brown looked down at him and said, "What's your name, young man?"<br><br>He said, "Simpson, sir. Orenthal J. Simpson. My friends call me O. J."<br><br>Now most of you know that O.J. Simpson has taken all but three of Jimmy Brown's rushing records while playing on two of the worst knees and two of the worst teams in professional football. He made that commitment--that dedication to excellence. Just think what you can do from your strong position with a sound body, with a real purpose and an effort, and with the direction of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You need to stay true and have a purpose in your life.<br><h2><b>Lots of Love</b></h2><br>In a stake conference in Palmerston North, New Zealand, a few months ago, I invited a reactivated member, a new convert, and a returned missionary to bear their testimonies. When we walked into the chapel there was a Maori sitting on the stand. I asked the stake president, "Who is that man on the stand?"<br><br>He said, "He's the one that was recently activated."<br><br>I said, "Wonderful."<br><br>We proceeded. When this man stood before the people, he said,<br><br><i>You all know me. I've lived in Palmerston North all my life. You know I have not been active in the Church. I would like to tell how I became active.</i><br><br><i>One day I was sitting at home. The afternoon movie was on. It was one I wanted to see. I had a big bag of potato chips and a great big drink--I was perfectly content. All of a sudden, I heard the back door open. My daughter walked into the room. She put her arm around me and said, "Daddy, will you take me to the temple?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "No, I won't take you to the temple."</i><br><br><i>Now, when a Polynesian says that, you know he means it. She walked around for a while and then went to her bedroom. The time came for a commercial break. I heard some crying. I got out of my chair, walked into the bedroom, and saw a pillow that was wet. I looked at my little daughter and said, "Sweetheart, what is the matter?"</i><br><br><i>She said, "Daddy, I've been praying for the privilege of going to the temple for baptisms for the dead and the opportunity came. The bishop invited me to go, and I promised him I would. Then I told the Lord no matter what, I would go. I had to work late. The boss wouldn't let me off and I missed the bus. I know the Lord's going to be disappointed and I know the bishop's going to be upset."</i><br><br><i>I said, "All right, I'll take you to the temple."</i>[The temple is four and a half hours from Palmerston North.]<br><br><i>I got in the car and was so mad that I had agreed to take her to the temple that I didn't speak to her all the way there. I drove up in front of the beautiful New Zealand Temple. She opened the door. She leaned over and put her arms around me. She said, "I love you, Daddy. Thank you very much." She kissed me on the cheek. She got out of the car and started to walk up the steps of the temple.</i><br><br><i>As I saw that young girl walk up the steps of the temple, my life started to change! By the time she had reached the doors of the temple I said to myself, "Is this the way it's going to be in eternity? Am I going to be on the outside as I see my family receive the blessings the Lord has promised me and our people?"</i><br><br><i>I sat without moving in that car for two hours. I did a lot of thinking and a lot of repenting. Then all of a sudden I saw the doors of the temple open. That little girl--she was radiant! It seemed like she was just almost translucent! She bounced down the steps. She opened the door and said, "Oh, Daddy, it was wonderful! There was such a special spirit there. Thank you, thank you! I love you!"</i><br><br><i>She kissed me again on the cheek. We talked all the way home about the sacred and the important things.</i><br><br>This Maori man continued, "That's why I'm here. That was six months ago. And now I want you to meet my family."<br><br>He turned a little to the side and said, "Will you stand?"<br><br>Eight children stood. He looked at each one and said, "She's been active five and a half months. And this one has been active five months. And this one four and a half months."<br><br>Then he said, "And there's my angel. The one that brought me back into the kingdom of my Father in Heaven." And he continued down the row. Finally, the last one was a tall boy. He didn't exactly look like a Latter-day Saint. He had long hair and he still had his hippie clothes on. But his dad said, "That's my last one. He's only been active two weeks. Give him a couple more and he'll look like the rest of us."<br><br>Eliminate your reluctance to reach out to one another. Build a network of supportive relationships. Utilize all the techniques that would bless and strengthen and build your life. Develop confidence. One of the surest ways to improve confidence is to make sure you have lots of love in your life. Go to whatever lengths are necessary to construct a network of sustaining and nurturing relationships. The real answer in accomplishing this is to deepen the friendships that you presently have. Utilize your family for strength and support. The ties that you make within your family are eternal ties. Learn to sacrifice for others. Be practical. Have fun. Enjoy one another. That is what life is all about. "Men are that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). When you're really willing to give of yourself, then life takes on a special meaning. It's not easy. Everything that you are going to accomplish in life that is worthwhile will have to be won by a struggle.<br><h2><b>It's Up to You</b></h2><br>I recently read the story of Sugar Ray Leonard--one of the great boxing athletes of our time. He tells how when he was a little boy he would have to walk fifteen miles on Saturday morning to go to the Smithsonian Institution. He stood in front of the museum and watched the tourists. As the tourists came to the entrance--there being no food allowed inside--they would take a last bite out of their hamburger and then deposit it in the garbage.<br><br>"We would get those hamburgers and we would finish 'em off," Sugar Ray said. "It's embarrassing now. But it filled my stomach then, and that was more important than anything else."<br><br>He first became an athlete involved in fencing. He was in a championship match to win the gold medal, but the referee was not giving him the points he was making. Finally, he turned to the referee and said, "If you're not going to call my points, I'm not going to continue." The referee ordered him to continue. He created such a fuss that 500 people gathered around them.<br><br>"I needed all the witness I could get that knew I was winning the points." He was down, according to the referee at that point, seven to two. He won his match nine to seven. He had put forth the effort. He had to make a decision, and he made it well. After he had finished with fencing, his manager asked him what he was going to do with his life. He said, "I don't know."<br><br>What a difficult position it was to be of a minority race and have to struggle to get to the top. Sugar Ray Leonard decided to become a boxer. His story is well known. He became a world champion. His statement, after all the struggles and the things that he went through, was simply this: "If it's going to get done, it's up to you."<br><br>Open your mind! Learn how to be successful in what you do! Remember Vince Lombardi's famous statement: "Success is winning--fairly, squarely, by the rules, but winning." Success is a worthy pursuit of a worthy ideal. If you want to, you can accomplish anything in life. You are a child of God. A very part of deity dwells in you. You respect that deity! You render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's. You need to keep yourself clean! Clean in mind, in body, and in person! So often lives are destroyed because you bow to someone else's standards. Your body and your mind are sacred. The way you treat them and cultivate them will determine the type of person you really are.<br><br>Remember that no man can serve two masters. Chart your course on correct principles. Keep the things of most value. One is your personal relationship with your Heavenly Father. In your mad struggle to get success and happiness in your life, to accomplish all the dreams that you dream, remember where it is that you really want to go.<br><h2><b>Proving Your Worth Now</b></h2><br>Not long ago a prominent attorney was called to take an important position in the Church. He hesitated because he knew it would take a lot of time, and he asked if he could think about it overnight. He came back the next morning to his priesthood leader with a broad grin on his face and said, "You know, when I get on the other side, I really don't think the Lord is going to ask me how many cases I've tried. I need to prove my worth now."<br><br>In all your efforts to succeed, remember the scripture that reads, "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors" (Alma 34:32).<br><br>Oh, how I would pray that you would respect yourself enough to be a self you respect! This means having a deep sense of responsibility for your thoughts and actions. It means keeping your word and being faithful to your family. It means believing in what you do and working hard. It means setting your internal standards and not comparing yourself to others. It is not a question of being better than somebody else. It is a question of being a worthy<i>you</i>. Respect and integrity demand that you be better than you thought you could be. Be loyal to yourself.<br><br>Many experiences in life fortify and strengthen the family relationship. So often in our lives we take for granted the special blessings and opportunities we enjoy. When they are taken from us, our hearts are filled with sorrow and regret. I think of the many blessings given under the inspiration of the Lord and the promises made if we but keep the commandments of God. How quickly these blessings affect our lives--the blessing of children, administering to the sick, the special blessings of priesthood that are given on occasion, and the prayers said by those who are faithful. The influence of the Spirit and our response to it make for an enriched and a happy life.<br><br>Be ye clean who bear the vessels of the Lord! You need to be proud of yourself, proud of who you are, proud of the heritage you have. You are the only you that has ever been created. You are the only you that will ever live. You are the only you that you can be proud of. One of my favorite poems goes like this:<br><br><i>When you get what you want in your struggle for self</i><br><i>And the world makes you king for a day,</i><br><i>Just go to the mirror and look at yourself</i><br><i>And see what "the man" has to say.</i><br><br><i>For it isn't your father or mother or wife</i><br><i>Whose judgment upon you must pass.</i><br><i>The fellow whose verdict counts in your life</i><br><i>Is the one staring back from the glass.</i><br><br><i>You may be like Jack Horner and chisel a plum</i><br><i>And think you're a wonderful guy.</i><br><i>But the "man in the glass" says you're only a bum</i><br><i>And you can't look him straight in the eye.</i><br><br><i>He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,</i><br><i>For he's with you clear to the end.</i><br><i>And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test</i><br><i>If the man in the glass is your friend.</i><br><br><i>You may fool the world down the pathway of years</i><br><i>And get pats on the back as you pass.</i><br><i>But your only reward will be heartaches and tears</i><br><i>If you've cheated "the man in the glass."</i><br>["The Man in the Glass"]<br><br>We must come to understand that there are basic truths and principles, basic conformities necessary to achieve happiness. There are some things that are false, some things that are wrong. For instance, we cannot be simultaneously happy and wicked. Never! Regardless of how generally accepted that course may be, wickedness never was happiness--never indeed can it be, nor will it ever be! We must understand that life is governed by laws, and when we receive any blessing or reward it is because of obedience to those laws.<br><br>Take with you your faith, your patriotism, your virtue, your integrity! If you've made mistakes in life, repent. You will come to know in the years ahead that life has precious little to offer without those attributes. Listen to the proper voices. Listen to the prophet of God. What good does it do to have a prophet if we do not listen? Respond to his teachings. Be faithful in all things. Commit yourself to others. Believe in others. Take time to nurture their dreams. Turn disappointments into strengths. Learn that you can strengthen and build the lives of people as you become involved with them. Lift them. Give them support and strength when their time of need comes. The pages of history are filled with heroic stories of men and women who have overcome difficulties and adversities. Lift up people! You may make another Abraham Lincoln or another Helen Keller because you have extended a feeling of love toward them.<br><br>Enjoy life's process, not only life's rewards. Just know that you can accomplish anything in this life, but know, too, that you need to enjoy life as you go. We become so involved in life that we want a three-minute oatmeal, a one-hour dry cleaning, and instant hamburgers and success. We must live one day at a time, enjoying and rejoicing in the little victories and realizing that life is an endless journey of self-discovery and personal fulfillment. It means taking time to be kind to your friends, to your wife, to your children, and then to other people.<br><br>Become involved in something bigger than yourself! I do not believe you will live happily if you set out to live life for yourself alone. Choose a cause bigger than you are, and work at it in the spirit of excellence. It will become part of you. Don't try to measure success by what you have done. Measure success by what you<i>can</i>do. Take time for what is important. We live in a busy world. There are so many things to do, so many responsibilities vying for our attention. But we need to take time for what is important.<br><br>Learn, in the process of your life, that your families are priceless. Just remember that each one of us has a sacred responsibility to take time for that which is important. One of the greatest blessings of life will be to have the approval of your conscience when you are alone with your thoughts. Those thoughts, then, are like being in the company of true and loving friends. Merit your own self-respect! Be someone. Be a self that you can respect. Get your life in order, and then you can truly be an asset to the Lord. Learn the beauty of being square with your Heavenly Father. When the Lord finds out that you are using all that he has given you, he will give you much more.<br><br>Oh, my young people, will you please try to develop a personal relationship with your Heavenly Father? It makes the process of life so much easier. As you feel of his spirit, as you listen to the right voices, you know you're on safe ground. Now the purpose and blessing of the Church is to bring the peace of the Savior into your lives and let you taste of the sweetness of the gospel by living its commandments.<br><br>We love you. We sustain you. We are honored to live in the time when you live, for you are the noble sons and daughters of God. And we are grateful that as the Church grows and develops, it will be placed in your sacred hands. We rejoice with you in our knowledge and understanding of the purposes of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We leave our witness and blessing with you. And I'd like to leave with you my choicest blessing, and that is my knowledge and testimony of the gospel. For with every power God has given me to know and to feel and understand, I know God lives! I know God lives! I know God lives! I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the World, the Son of God, the Prince of Peace! His is the only name under heaven whereby men can get back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. I know that God the Father and his Son appeared unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, that he saw what he said he saw, and he heard what he said he heard! And because of that vision of the Father and the Son, the kingdom of God has been established upon the face of the earth. And this is that kingdom--the only kingdom under heaven whereby we can get back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. I know that we have a living prophet standing at the head of this great church. I bear my witness to you and express my love for him. I know the Book of Mormon is a second witness to all the world that Jesus Christ is who we claim him to be.<br><br>So I express my great love to you. I rejoice in the opportunity of bearing witness and testimony to you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Philip T.

<h1>Understanding of the Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Each time I come to Brigham Young University, I realize that I am standing before a royal army prepared to go out to be in the world but not of the world. BYU is an exceptional university of learning because it was founded on the premise that all subjects taught here would be taught with a special spirit of learning that would allow you to develop your gifts and talents and prepare each of you for the tests of life. It enables those who come here to be temporally and spiritually self-sufficient not just for their own goals and creature comforts, but to stand strong on higher ground in order to lift, help, and serve others.<br><h2><b>The Purpose of Life</b></h2><br>You are preparing to meet the tests of mortal life. We voluntarily came from the presence of God the Father to this mortal probation with free agency, knowing we would have opposition in all things (2 Nephi 2:11). Our objective is to take upon us the "whole armor" and withstand "the fiery darts of the adversary" with our sword of the Spirit and shield of faith (see 1 Nephi 15:24 and D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18), to endure to the end, and to be worthy to stand and live in the presence of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ for all eternity--to achieve what is called eternal life.<br><h2><b>Preparation for the Tests of Life</b></h2><br>Most of you are in your third decade of learning. The first two decades were years of development and growth in preparation for this third critical decade of learning. This is a period of your life to prepare for the tests of future years. How do you prepare for the tests to come?<br><h2><b>"With All Thy Getting Get Understanding"</b></h2><br>In the Bible, the book of Proverbs outlines a progression of learning that is important to all of us.<br><br>We are taught that basic intelligence (which is innate) and worldly knowledge (which is learned) are the beginnings for our attainment of wisdom.<br><br><i>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</i>[and knowledge]. [Proverbs 9:10; see also Proverbs 1:7]<br><br><i>But fools despise wisdom and instruction.</i>[Proverbs 1:7]<br><br><i>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.</i>[Proverbs 1:5]<br><br>From wisdom, if we will listen to wise counsel and take the teachings to our hearts, we will gain an understanding in our hearts.<br><br><i>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding.</i>[Proverbs 1:2]<br><br><i>So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</i><br><br><i>... and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</i><br><br><i>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</i><br><br><i>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</i>[Proverbs 2:2–6]<br><br><i>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</i>[Proverbs 4:7]<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><br><br><i>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</i>[Proverbs 3:5–7]<br><br>When we have done wrong, Solomon's advice is:<br><br><i>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:</i><br><br><i>For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</i><br><br><i>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</i>[Proverbs 3:11–13]<br><br><i>Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</i><br><br><i>Get wisdom, get understanding.</i>[Proverbs 4:4–5]<br><br>The difference between intelligence and knowledge--at the lower end of the hierarchy of learning--and wisdom--which comes through life's experiences, turning us to the Lord and ultimately to learning in our hearts--is shown in a simple scripture: "The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens" (Proverbs 3:19).<br><br>There is a great deal of difference between raw intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, and finally, the understanding with which the Lord established the heavens. This learning process applies to each of us, but especially to you who are studying at this unique university because this university recognizes the progression of learning that begins with God-given, innate intelligence. It recognizes knowledge through your courses of study and then the attainment of wisdom--recognizing obedience to laws, ordinances, and commandments--ultimately leading to an understanding in your hearts of true gospel principles that far exceed the teachings of men. This education leads us to use our gifts and talents in selfless service by helping others and caring for the needy.<br><br>The importance of understanding in one's heart is that our faith in believing becomes a full knowledge of understanding, and it causes us to control our actions.<br><br>In three decades of counseling I have become aware of many ways we may be tested. Here are but a few tests that those assembled here today may have to face in their lives. Will you be prepared? How will you respond?<br><br>1. The test for some will be being single and lonely. Are you prepared to be self-sufficient and productive, and are you prepared to be of help to others?<br><br>2. The test for some will be being married to the wrong person, resulting in abuse and divorce.<br><br>3. Then, the test may be to provide for a family without a partner's support.<br><br>4. Some will have the test of not being able to have children. The test may come even when you have lived faithfully, abiding by moral laws and commandments of chastity, faithfulness, fidelity, and love to an eternal companion. A sobering thought, but one that should be noted in your prayers, is that national studies have shown that one in five men and two in five women will have complications or will be unable to have children. Sometimes a physical law circumvents a spiritual goal, and you may have to consider the alternative of adoption. Do not base your testimony on one goal and allow bitter disappointment to prevent you from enjoying your companionship and the greater goal of eternal progression.<br><br>5. The test for some will be having the children who can both be the joy and the trial of your life.<br><br>6. Some will have the test of being widowed or will experience the death of a loved one. Do not become angry and blame your departed loved one for leaving you alone. Do not blame God for allowing it to happen or yourself for having done something to cause the death.<br><br>7. Some will have the test of illness and poor health.<br><br>8. Some will have friends and companions betray their trust.<br><br>9. For some the test will be having financial woes of employment failure, economic depression, or unwise investments.<br><h2><b>Invulnerability</b></h2><br>Wouldn't we all like to avoid the tests and trials of this mortal probation?<br><br>In Greek mythology, Achilles was the hero of Homer's<i>Iliad.</i>In addition to Homer's historical account of Achilles, later authors developed fables or folklore about Achilles and his mother, Thetis.<br><br>Thetis, in an attempt to make Achilles immortal, concealed him by night in fire and anointed him by day with ambrosia. According to some accounts, Thetis also endeavored to make Achilles immortal by dipping him in the River Styx. She succeeded in making Achilles' body invulnerable and immortal with the exception of the ankles by which she held him.<br><br>Achilles grew up to be an invincible warrior, leading the Greek army against Troy. His death is mentioned in<i>The Odyssey.</i>He is said to have been killed by Apollo, either in the likeness of Paris, or by an arrow of Paris directed by Apollo to his only vulnerability--his ankle (the Achilles tendon).<br><br>Wouldn't every mother like to find the secret of protecting her children, making them invulnerable from the fiery darts of the adversary?<br><br>Unfortunately, we cannot protect ourselves from the slings and arrows of misfortune. In fact, we are told to carry the shield of faith to protect us from the fiery darts of the adversary. We also know from Lehi's advice to his son Jacob that there must be "opposition in all things" in this mortal probation (2 Nephi 2:11). A basic reason for our learning experiences in this life is to enable us to endure to the end. Our challenges, learning experiences, and the opposition we come up against are supposed to strengthen us, not defeat or destroy us.<br><br>Joseph Smith pleaded with the Lord in Liberty Jail for the suffering Saints. Joseph, with several companions, had been in Liberty Jail under miserable conditions for several months. He pleaded,<br><br><i>O God, where art thou?...</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people ..., and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>... how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>The Lord's clear answer was calming:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Our hurts, as difficult as they are to endure and as unbearable as they may seem to us in the present tense of time, are, in the Lord's eternal perspective, but "a small moment." The test is whether we endure the adversity and affliction well, without losing our faith and breaking commandments.<br><br>Joseph was told in his difficult circumstances that<br><br><i>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:26]<br><br>We can have that same gift if we remain faithful.<br><br>How important it is during troubled times, when we are tested, that we do not do anything to lose the Holy Ghost's gentle persuasions, comfort, and peace that will give us assurance to make the correct choices in life in order to weather the storm and bring us closer to God's ways--not man's ways.<br><br>Joseph Smith was told:<br><br><i>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</i><br><br><i>Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they did Job.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:9–10]<br><br>Our friends are important at all times, especially in times of need when we are depressed with feelings of loneliness and despair. Choosing our friends wisely is important. In times of trouble, do your friends stand by you? What kind of a friend or companion are you?<br><br>Often we choose our friends by their physical appearance and personalities. The best dancer, the most fashionable, the same geographic home area (city or rural, east or west), the most athletic, the sharpest car, the most handsome, the most beautiful, the most charming personality, the most intelligent, the richest, or the poorest are just a few of the criteria for selecting dates or friends. These are all superficial.<br><br>The first test of friendship and companionship is knowing that in their company it is easier to live according to the commandments you have been taught and know are important to happiness.<br><br>The second test of real friendship and companionship is whether you are asked as a condition of their friendship or companionship to choose between their way and the Lord's way. For example, true friendship does not exist if a condition of that friendship is to participate in breaking moral laws or the Word of Wisdom with phrases like: "Try it just once," "Everyone does it," "Who is going to know?" "Show me that you really love me."<br><br>My point in naming a few of the tests we face is to remind you that blessings come after the trial of our faith and that opposition is given as an essential element in our mortal probation and spiritual growth even if we are as perfect as Job. Yet Job suffered the loss of his material possessions, his sons and daughters were taken from him, boils from head to foot were inflicted as a painful physical test, and he experienced depression as a mental test. In his depression, Job said:<br><br><i>My soul is weary of my life ...; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</i>[Job 10:1]<br><br><i>I should have been carried from the womb to the grave</i>. [Job 10:19]<br><br><i>I am full of confusion.</i>[Job 10:15]<br><br>In all of Job's trouble, he wept for him that was in trouble and his soul grieved for the poor. This is the mark of a great man. (see Job 30:25)<br><br>In all of Job's trials, he kept his testimony that his Redeemer liveth. At the end of the first chapter of Job it says he "sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."<br><br>When we are marred spiritually or physically, our first reaction is to withdraw into the dark shadows of depression, to blot out hope and joy--the light of life that comes from knowing we are living the commandments of our Father in Heaven. This withdrawal will ultimately lead us to rebellion against those who would like to be our friends, those who can help us most, even our family. But worst of all, we finally reject ourselves.<br><br>Those who are alone and lonely should not retreat to the sanctuary of their private thoughts and chambers. Such retreat will ultimately lead them into the darkening influence of the adversary, which leads to despondency, loneliness, frustration, and to thinking of themselves as worthless. After one thinks of himself as worthless, he then ofttimes turns to associates who corrode those delicate spiritual contacts, rendering their spiritual receiving antennas and transmitters useless. What good is it to associate with and ask advice of someone who is disoriented himself and only tells us what we want to hear? Isn't it better to turn to loving parents, friends, and associates who can help us reach for and attain celestial goals?<br><br><i>And he said: Go and tell this people--Hear ye indeed, but they understood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.</i><br><br><i>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed.</i>[2 Nephi 16:9–10]<br><br>What can you do to prepare yourself during your college years for the tests and trials of your life?<br><br>1. You must learn to work hard toward your goals, to pray for strength and guidance in your daily decisions, always acknowledging "Thy will be done."<br><br>2. Study the scriptures, history, biographical literature, and psychology to give you an insight into how others have met life's challenges and, with a testimony, endured to the end.<br><br>3. Select friends and an eternal companion from whom you can seek counsel and who will lift you and make it easier to live the commandments by just being together.<br><br>4. Learn to be of service and of help to others in their tests no matter how busy you are or how much you are hurting from your own tests and trials of faith.<br><br>5. Learn that even in a perfect life the tests and trials will come, but remember that you can bring affliction upon yourself and those near you through your own actions. Be willing to accept the consequences that come and don't blame them on God.<br><br>6. Learn that when you have made a mistake, regrets are not enough. Feeling sorry is not enough unless your sorrow brings about a remorse of conscience and a change of heart resulting in true repentance.<br><br>7. Learn that true education is not only test scores and grade point averages, but also gaining wisdom through life's experiences, listening to sound counsel, gaining an understanding in your heart, and caring for others less fortunate. Then, no amount of temptation, testing, trials, or coercion can make you depart from the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life.<br><br>8. Learn that in mortal probation you are here for tests and trials even though you live a perfect life.<br><br>9. Learn to know yourself while you are at the university. You are in a laboratory that simulates the world with individual competition and the inner stress of learning. There will never be a better time in your life to have the contemplation and introspection needed to know yourself. Take time to ponder who you are and act accordingly. General education requirements are given not only to give you a well-rounded education, but also to give you an opportunity to assess your intellectual and spiritual strengths and weaknesses. What are your God-given gifts and talents? (see D&amp;amp;C 46)<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie, in his book<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>, has said:<br><br><i>Spirits developed an infinite variety and degree of talents while yet in preexistence.</i><br><br><i>Being subject to law, and having their agency, all the spirits of men, while yet in the Eternal Presence, developed aptitudes, talents, capacities, and abilities of every sort, kind, and degree. During the long expanse of life which then was, an infinite variety of talents and abilities came into being. As the ages rolled, no two spirits remained alike. Mozart became a musician; Einstein centered his interest in mathematics; Michelangelo turned his attention to painting. Cain was a liar, a schemer, a rebel who maintained a close affinity to Lucifer. Abraham and Moses and all of the prophets sought and obtained the talent for spirituality. Mary and Eve were two of the greatest of all the spirit daughters of the Father. The whole house of Israel, known and segregated out from their fellows, was inclined toward spiritual things. And so it went through all the hosts of heaven, each individual developing such talents and abilities as his soul desired.</i><br><br><i>The Lord endowed us all with agency; he gave us laws that would enable us to advance and progress and become like him; and he counseled and exhorted us to pursue the course leading to glory and exaltation. He himself was the embodiment and personification of all good things. Every desirable characteristic and trait dwelt in him in its eternal fullness. All of his obedient children started to become like him in one way or another. There was as great a variety and degree of talent and ability among us there as there is among us here. Some excelled in one way, others in another. The Firstborn excelled all of us in all things.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>,<i>Book</i>1 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979), p. 23; see also D&amp;amp;C 46]<br><br>Have you given yourself an honest chance to develop your natural skills, or are you limiting your development to the requirements for graduation or a profession without assessing how you will make the greatest contribution and be the happiest during your sojourn on earth?<br><br>Before a seventies quorum meeting, one of the seventies was asked if he could play the piano. His response was classic: "I don't know, I haven't tried to play the piano."<br><br>Your university educational experience should be a microcosm of life. For this reason, if the opportunity presents itself, serving on committees in student government, social committees, or interacting with the faculty and university administration will simulate civic involvement in your future life. Your social committees and social awareness and interactions are all part of the laboratory in which you are privileged to participate.<br><br>Some years ago, when Howard S. McDonald was inaugurated as president of Brigham Young University, in the inaugural address entitled "The Glory of God Is Intelligence," Dr. Edwin A. Lee said:<br><br><i>While I was an undergraduate at Columbia University, there was a man in attendance already known as the perennial student. He had been left a modest but adequate bequest with the stipulation that it should continue as long as he was engaged in collegiate study: thereafter, the income was to be given to charity. When I returned for graduate work twelve years later, he was still there and he remained a student until he died just a few years ago. It was said that he had been granted every degree offered by Columbia and had taken practically every course. He was a man who was the epitome of erudition. No field of knowledge was foreign to him. He was probably more widely-read than the best of his professors. He was a cultured gentleman. But, he was not a truly intelligent man. Certainly such intelligence as he possessed was not that which is the Glory of God. Inherently he was selfish. He never married. He was without ambition or influence. He was a joke to the students and a freak to the faculty. He knew a prodigious lot, but his real index of intelligence was low, no matter what his I.Q.</i>[Inauguration Services of Howard S. McDonald, 14 November 1945, in BYU Archives, p. 34]<br><br>And so knowledge of facts alone can be of little value.<br><br>In section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, we are told to<br><br><i>beware lest ye are deceived; ... seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;</i>(v. 8)<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, ... that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me....</i>(v. 9)<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them...</i>(v. 11)<br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another.</i>(v. 12)<br><br>The key is "that all may be profited thereby." May I repeat for emphasis "that all may be profited thereby."<br><br><i>And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:26]<br><br>And finally, from section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 28 and 29: "He that asketh in Spirit shall receive in Spirit; ... in order that every member may be profited thereby."<br><br>The reason you are here at the university is not solely to improve your value in the marketplace or for selfish reasons of intellectual gamesmanship. You are here for the eternal perspective of learning, to enable you to stand on higher ground to lift, to serve, and to care for those in need around you, both in your family and in the communities in which you reside. "Thee lift me and I'll lift thee, and we will ascend together."<br><br>Please remember to give--before you leave this unique institution of learning--appreciation and deserved praise to members of the faculty and staff for their dedication to the eternal principles of learning. Sincere recognition of your teachers' contributions to your life is small payment for their sacrifices in sharing their gifts and talents with many who pass through without acknowledgment of their service.<br><h2><b>Stewardship</b></h2><br>In June of 1965, a group of brethren in the Physical Facilities Department of the Church was doing some work outside the Hotel Utah apartment of President David O. McKay. As President McKay stopped to explain to them the importance of the work in which they were engaged, he paused and told them the following:<br><br><i>Let me assure you, Brethren, that some day you will have a personal priesthood interview with the Savior, Himself. If you are interested, I will tell you the order in which He will ask you to account for your earthly responsibilities.</i><br><br><i>First, He will request an accountability report about your relationship with your wife. Have you actively been engaged in making her happy and ensuring that her needs have been met as an individual?</i><br><br><i>Second, He will want an accountability report about each of your children individually. He will not attempt to have this for simply a family stewardship but will request information about your relationship to each and every child.</i><br><br><i>Third, He will want to know what you personally have done with the talents you were given in the pre-existence.</i><br><br><i>Fourth, He will want a summary of your activity in your Church assignments. He will not be necessarily interested in what assignments you have had, for in his eyes the home teacher and a mission president are probably equals, but He will request a summary of how you have been of service to your fellowmen in your Church assignments.</i><br><br><i>Fifth, He will have no interest in how you earned your living, but if you were honest in all your dealings.</i><br><br><i>Sixth, He will ask for an accountability on what you have done to contribute in a positive manner to your community, state, country and the world.</i>[From Notes of Fred A. Baker, Managing Director, Department of Physical Facilities]<br><br>May we be able to meet these tests with affirmative answers and receive a loving welcome home from the Lord, who we hope will say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."<br><br>It is my fervent desire that each of us will use our God-given intelligence to gain the knowledge, wisdom, and understanding in our hearts to meet life's tests and trials and to endure to the end. May each of us use our gifts and talents to protect, love, and lift others in a caring way is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert D. Hales was Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 15 March 1988.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h2><b>Mountains and Valleys</b></h2><br>Recently, while flying from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, the pilot suggested we look out the right side of the plane and see in the distance a snow-capped mountain called Mount Whitney. Mount Whitney is one of the highest peaks in the United States. It reaches into the sky 14,495 feet. The pilot immediately drew our attention to another interesting sight. This was Death Valley--the lowest point in the United States at 280 feet below sea level. How unusual to see, in this panoramic picture out of an airplane window, both these extremes of nature.<br><br>The higher up the mountain we climb, the broader our vision. We can see peaks and valleys. We can see the beauty of forests, and then we notice barren places above the timberline.<br><br>There is a parallel to these heights and depths in the way people live their lives--some living below the sea level of humanity and others towering high in the heavens above them.<br><br>The distance from Mount Whitney to Death Valley, the way the crow flies, is approximately seventy-five miles--so close in distance, yet so far away and different in circumstances.<br><br>A mountain-peak view of life can be seen clearly in the lives of those people recorded in the Book of Mormon. We observe the continual climbing and falling, the living high and low in life's strata. They prospered, then found themselves in the very depths of despair in captivity.<br><br>Now take a moment and think: Where are<i>you</i>living? On top of Mount Whitney or in Death Valley?<br><br>We can learn lessons of eternal perspective by observing the lives of others. Life can be a cycle of various levels of existence. The living of life is a great contest, greater than basketball or football. The prize is the hearts of men and women--your heart and my heart. When our hearts are not properly attuned, we are unlikely to respond to the pleadings of the Spirit.<br><br>Satan is most anxious to capture our hearts and place us in bondage to him to draw us into spiritual darkness.<br><br><i>He ... is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness .</i>. .<i>from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.</i>[Helaman 6:30]<br><br>For thousands of years Satan has refined his devious tactics designed to capture our attention--one way is by enticing us through our physical senses. He coaxes, entices, and cajoles us to reach out--to reach out to that which degrades. He convinces even intelligent creatures to walk in paths covered with roots and brambles, hoping to trip us so we might fall and sink into the gloom of his power. If we do fall, we will be deep in the ravine of life, weighed down by spiritual darkness. In this uncomfortable, far-off place we see a sign: "Bondage." Bondage to whom? To Satan.<br><br>But if we will look up, we will see a small ray of light piercing through the circumstances of spiritual darkness. This gives us hope. How can we find the path that will lead us upward?<br><br>The Lord will beckon us to turn to him. Ammon teaches that<br><br><i>If ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.</i>[Mosiah 7:33]<br><br>How can we be delivered from this spiritual bondage? When the heart grows cold and hard, the light of spirituality goes out. Hardening of the heart can be just as dangerous to one's spiritual health as hardening of the arteries is to one's physical health. Hardening of the arteries can cause physical death. Hardening of the heart can cause a more serious death--the death of the spirit. When the heart is softened, the Lord can reach out--bringing comfort and spiritual warmth--and give us direction to help us reach our ultimate destination.<br><h2><b>Climbing up the Mountain</b></h2><br>As we consider making a trip, one of our first priorities is to find a road map that will clearly outline roads and distances. If we are traveling in a car, we make sure it is in good condition. We make certain our car insurance is current and in force. Having selected our route, we fill the gas tank. As we travel, highway numbers and warning signs will be carefully observed.<br><br>Being on the correct route and traveling with a consciousness of varying conditions such as speed limits, curves, and narrow bridges will allow us to arrive safely at our destination. Warning signs are extremely important.<br><br>The same is true as we hike on a trail in the mountains. Signs will indicate direction as well as dangerous conditions. We'll want to be aware of narrow places on the trail and where there are precipitous slopes down the mountainside. Loose rocks, sand, or anything that could cause unsafe footing will be most carefully observed.<br><br>Do you need some direction so you can climb to a higher plane? Let's listen to this counsel:<br><br><i>He</i>[the Lord]<i>did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.</i>[Mosiah 29:20]<br><br>They did two things. "They did humble themselves before him" and "they cried mightily unto him." So we have the attitude of humility and supplication in prayer. This will bring to us a desire to reorder our lives.<br><br>Responding to this counsel, we observe at the base of the mountain a trail with a sign lettered "Humility" pointing up the mountainside.<br><br>Mustering all our strength, we find ourselves moving slightly upward. We feel exhilaration. It occurs to us that if we follow this marked trail with proper effort, there is a possibility we could climb even higher.<br><br>King Benjamin counseled:<br><br><i>And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</i>[Mosiah 4:10]<br><br>The Lord will reward our honest efforts.<br><br>At the side of the trail we now notice the sign marked "Repentance." In Mosiah the Lord is quoted directly: "Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses" (Mosiah 26:30).<br><br>Warmed by his spirit of forgiveness, we climb higher up the mountain and find yet another sign on the path--this one marked "Obedience." We will have a very strong yearning to be obedient and yield our hearts to our Heavenly Father. Speaking of the experiences of the Nephites, we are told:<br><br><i>They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i>[Helaman 3:35]<br><br>What will be the result of moving out of spiritual bondage and up the mountainside through humility and prayer, then passing through repentance and obedience?<br><br>King Benjamin tells us that<br><br><i>all that</i>[the Lord]<i>requires of you</i>is<i>to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</i>[Mosiah 2:22]<br><br>Keeping the commandments has led us to stand now atop the mountain peak. How magnificent the view! How pure the air! How stimulating the feeling of having arrived!<br><h2><b>The Descent</b></h2><br>As we now live on this mountaintop of spiritual communication with our Heavenly Father, are we safe? Or are there some cautions?<br><br><i>And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression.</i>[3 Nephi 6:5]<br><br>Why would anyone want to fall into transgression from this sweet communication with him who is our Father? What could possibly cause us to lose our footing and slip partly down the mountainside?<br><br>Let's listen to the wisdom of the scriptures as they describe earlier travelers through this life who began to yield to human tendencies.<br><br><i>And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church--not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God.</i>[Helaman 3:33]<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceeding great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</i>[Helaman 3:36]<br><br>Pride was born in their hearts because of the gift of prosperity from him who temporarily shared a part of his creation with them. As we take inappropriate pride in our earthly accumulations, we distance ourselves from him who is the fountain of all that is good. Thus we have started our descent down the mountainside. Can we turn about and climb up again? Yes! How? We must forget our foolish pride in human accomplishments, turning our faces once again upward in supplication and gratitude.<br><br>If we fail to return upward, loose rocks or shale can make us lose our footing and cause us to be drawn farther down the side of the mountain. Alma asks, "Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy?" (Alma 5:29). As we look about and find others who have fine homes and cars and boats and we observe our own possessions, the eye of envy purges humility from our hearts; then we slip down farther into the valley.<br><br><i>Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.</i>[Moroni 7:12]<br><br>If we respond to the invitation to sin and do evil continually, and allow pride and then envy to envelop us, we drop back into the bondage of him who is the author of spiritual darkness, and we are now found below sea level in the depths of Death Valley. We have completed the cycle of life as described in the sacred scriptures.<br><h2><b>Where Are We in the Cycle?</b></h2><br>Now let's check the map of life to see where we have been according to the cycles reported in the scriptures. Beginning in spiritual darkness--which is being in bondage to this evil but very real power of one who is trying to claim the hearts of those of us here in this probationary state of our existence--we journey through humility and the beginning of faith in him who governs this world. The momentum of this move will carry us through repentance and then to obedience to the principles of the gospel. We then come to the destination and heights of spiritual peace and prosperity.<br><br>The challenge is to maintain our equilibrium in this state of close relationship with the Spirit of the Lord. If we then become careless and allow pride to enter our hearts, followed by envy, we'll soon lower our resistance to the foolish acts of transgression and arrive once again at the bottom, with our vision impaired by spiritual darkness.<br><br>Life gives us two options. One is to go through this cycle repeatedly, experiencing all the heights and depths of ascension and descension but never learning. Or we can struggle up the mountainside of life, observing, learning, internalizing, and acquiring spiritual character that will position us on the mountain peak of spiritual peace and prosperity, where we can see to the eternities and enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>In all of this journey of life it is well to remember that a loving father is in his heaven pleading, reaching out to us through prophets in their records of sacred writ. Our Father in Heaven has manifested his love for us by ransoming his son in our behalf that we might be forgiven our foolishness and lifted out of the bondage of spiritual darkness.<br><br>If you were to ask me, "What can I do to keep myself properly attuned to the Spirit of the Lord?" and "If I feel a distancing from the Spirit, what will help me close the distance and warm my relationship?" I would suggest a daily and a weekly program.<br><br>Talking something through with someone we respect brings us to a common understanding. We are given the advantage of the other person's wisdom. Who better to talk with concerning our challenges and plans, than the wisest of all, our Heavenly Father? Verbalizing these concerns brings them to the surface and exposes them to the wisdom of the ages. Then we must listen for promptings and impressions from that divine source.<br><br>The heavens want to communicate with us and lift us heavenward. Our responsibility is to tune in the proper channel. So, I suggest to you that you pray daily, morning and night.<br><br>One other practice will bring a great return on the time invested: drinking daily from the scriptures. It might be as little as a verse some days. Other days it could be chapters and many pages. The ever-constant taking in of spiritual truths will develop sinew and muscle to carry us forward and upward in the pursuit of life in its eternal journey.<br><br>With the daily practice of prayer and scriptural exposure, we will be protected from many otherwise unhappy moments. But unhappy moments will come. We will not always live up to even our own expectations.<br><br>There is a weekly opportunity to reorient our journey--to ponder, meditate, and inventory our feelings. We can bow in reverence for the gift of atonement--the forgiveness proffered us by the cross and the sepulchre. We partake of the bread and water and witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of the Son, always remembering him and keeping his commandments so we may have his spirit to be with us.<br><h2><b>Channels of Power</b></h2><br>Let me share a growing experience between a man spiritually mature in his understanding and appreciation for the significance of these sacred emblems and a young deacon who was but beginning his association with eternal truths.<br><br><i>The sacrament never really meant much to me until the Sunday I was ordained a deacon. That afternoon I passed the sacrament for the first time. Prior to the meeting, one of the deacons warned me, "Look out for Brother Schmidt. You may have to wake him up!" Finally the time came for me to participate in the passing of the sacrament. I handled the first six rows quite well. Children and adults partook of the bread with no noticeable thought or problem. Then I got to row seven, the row where Brother Schmidt always sat. But I was surprised. Instead of being asleep he was wide awake. Unlike many of the others I had served, he took the bread with what seemed to be great thought and reverence.</i><br><br><i>A few minutes later I found myself again approaching row seven with the water. This time my friend was right. Brother Schmidt sat with his head bowed and his big German eyes shut. He was evidently sound asleep. What could I do or say? I looked for a moment at his brow, wrinkled and worn from years of toil and hardship. He had joined the Church as a teenager and had experienced much persecution in his small German town. I had heard the story many times in testimony meeting. I decided finally to gently nudge his shoulder in hopes of waking him. As I reached to do so, his head slowly lifted. There were tears streaming down his cheeks and as I looked into his eyes I saw love and joy. He quietly reached up and took the water. Even though I was only twelve then, I can still remember vividly the feeling I had as I watched this rugged old man partake of the sacrament. I knew without a doubt that he was feeling something about the sacrament that I had never felt. I determined then that I wanted to feel those same feelings.</i>...<br><br><i>It had been seven years since John had the experience of first passing the sacrament to Brother Schmidt. Since that time he had watched Brother Schmidt carefully. John continued to gain a greater and greater appreciation for his faith and love of the Savior. In two weeks John would be in the mission field, but prior to leaving he wanted to do something he had desired for years--have a personal talk with Brother Schmidt. Saturday evening John went to Brother Schmidt's home. He lived alone. His wife had passed away a few years earlier. As John entered the small but neatly kept home, he felt a special spirit. Pictures of some of the temples were hung neatly on one wall. On another wall was a painting of the Savior kneeling in Gethsemane. John began, "Brother Schmidt, ever since I first passed the sacrament to you I sensed it has a profound meaning in your life. Before I leave for the mission field, I want to find out why this ordinance that some seem to take so lightly is so meaningful to you." Brother Schmidt didn't answer for a few moments. His eyes seemed to focus on the picture of Christ that hung on the wall before him. Then he said, "John, after I joined the Church in Germany, many of my friends deserted me. My family was also upset and for a time I was left almost completely alone. I desperately needed a source of strength and power to help me survive the challenges I was facing. One day I was reading in the Doctrine and Covenants." Brother Schmidt turned to these verses and read:</i><br><br><i>"Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i><br><br><i>"And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh;</i><br><br><i>"For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live. (D&amp;amp;C 84:20–22).</i><br><br><i>"As I read those verses," he continued, the revelation came to me that the powers of godliness are really manifest in the ordinances of the gospel. I began to see that ordinances are indeed channels of power. That is to say, through ordinances we can literally partake of the spirit and power that emanates from God. I then began a personal study to learn all I could about the ordinances of the gospel. As I studied I became impressed that the sacrament is one of the most important keys to spiritual growth and strength. I decided as a young man that, no matter what went on around me, my ability to live the gospel and to have a personal relationship with Christ could be strengthened as I partook worthily of the sacrament. Sunday after Sunday I went to the sacrament service hungry</i>--<i>hungry to partake of the power of Jesus Christ in my life. Gradually I learned that those who hunger and thirst after righteousness can be filled with the Holy Ghost. Since then, John, I have tried to make the sacrament a time of total worship--a time to think of the Lord and of my behavior during the preceding week, a time to repent and to make commitments. Now, each day of the week, I look forward to the sacrament. To always remember my Savior is a commitment for every day, as well as Sunday."</i><br><br><i>John was greatly impressed by what Brother Schmidt had said and asked, "But, Brother Schmidt, don't you ever get distracted by the noises during the passing of the sacrament?"</i><br><br><i>"John, it isn't always an easy thing to make the sacrament a total worship experience. Sometimes outside influences and distracting thoughts can sidetrack our purpose for being there. But I have found that if I go to a sacrament meeting with a purpose and desire to communicate with the Lord these distractions can be handled more easily."</i><br><br><i>As John walked home, he again remembered that day seven years earlier when he had watched Brother Schmidt. Once again the emotions welled up within him. With renewed determination he whispered, "I want to feel those feelings too."</i>[<i>Book of Mormon Student Manual (Religion 121–122)</i>(Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1979), pp. 417, 422–23]<br><br>The fuel for our eternal journey can be prayer, scriptural truths, and the companionship of the Holy Spirit through partaking of the sacrament. If we are thus fortified, spiritual darkness cannot place us in bondage. If captured momentarily, we will break out through humility, repentance, and obedience to find spiritual peace and prosperity. Then pride, envy, and wickedness will not pull us down the mountainside into the depths of Death Valley.<br><br>The power of heaven is awaiting our efforts. May we--you and I--be responsive to this beckoning surge of power that we might be safeguarded from the protruding roots across our paths and the loose rocks or sand that can impede our eternal journey. May we place our hand in his to be guided and lifted heavenward, prepared to give our hearts fully and completely as evidence of our desire to be warmly embraced in his love.<br><br>God is in his heaven. Jesus Christ is our Savior. He lived in the meridian of time. He organized the Church. He called others about him. He was placed on the cross and then in the tomb. He lives today. And because he lives today we can live eternally. May we live on this spiritual plane in close communication with the source of all power, I pray humbly in the very sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1>aith, and the Book of Mormon - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Holland, fellow members and friends of the Brigham Young University community, I am humbled by the invitation to speak to you this morning. And I pray, as we pause for these few minutes, that the Lord will bless our minds and spirits as he has so many times before in devotionals on this great campus.<br><br>As I speak today, I consider my two principal credentials to be my testimony of the divine origins of the Book of Mormon and my unrelenting desire to know more about this wonderful and wondrous book. Over the last twenty years, I have made the Book of Mormon a matter of continual study, and the book has rewarded me far beyond anything I fully deserved and far beyond anything I could ever have imagined. That's the way I have always found it with the Lord--you can never fully anticipate his ways or really deserve all his blessings.<br><br>My desire this morning is to present a few ideas about current Book of Mormon research, and I hope and pray you will find them interesting and enlightening.<br><h2><b>A Bounteous Book</b></h2><br>We have heard much about the Book of Mormon in recent years. A person would need to be both deaf and blind not to have noticed that President Benson has made it a main theme of paramount importance. The significance of the Book of Mormon to us as a people, both individually and collectively, can hardly be overstated. "Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations," Joseph Smith said, "and where is our religion? We have none" (<i>HC</i>2:52).<br><br>This book has given us more than just a name. Far more, it serves us as a spiritual tutor, teaching us to hear and know the voice of our master and to recognize the witness of the Holy Ghost. It serves us as a fountain of wisdom, explaining like no other source the plan of salvation and our present human condition. It stands as a sign of the Restoration in these the latter days and as a witness of Jesus Christ, signaling to all those who have ears to hear and eyes to see that God has been at work here in this world. It is a key to our covenants. For example, few of us think about the fact that the words of the baptismal prayer and of the sacrament prayers we use every week were first revealed in this dispensation through the translation of 3 Nephi 11 and Moroni 4–5. The book is also our guide to how we should live and contains a full disclosure statement about how we will be judged.<br><br>It is many, many things. It is a wonderful book with endless uses and applications. It is the primary vehicle through which God has chosen to communicate his covenant gospel in our day to all people--the rich, the poor, the old, the young, black, white, married, or single. There are few things in this life more important for us to do than to know, love, and follow the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Because it is so full and rich, many of its dimensions remain sealed to all who do not make its study a matter of lifetime pursuit. No matter who you are--a recent convert or a serious scholar, a saint or an unrepentant sinner--the Book of Mormon speaks to your level. It begins where you are and addresses your needs and your interests. In its fullness, we have hardly scratched the surface. There are many lessons, of all kinds, that we have yet to learn from its pages.<br><br>The Lord has been after his Saints for a long time to do more with the Book of Mormon. As early as 1832, he chastised the members of the Church in Kirtland, Ohio, for neglecting the Book of Mormon, saying that "the children of Zion, even all . . . shall remain under . . . condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon" (D&amp;amp;C 84:56–57). As recently as 1984, President Benson reissued this same stern admonition. In October conference that year, he said,<i>"</i>As I participated in the Mexico City Temple dedication, I received the distinct impression that God is not pleased with our neglect of the Book of Mormon" ("A New Witness for Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, p. 6). He made it very clear that we are still languishing under that same condemnation of 150 years ago. Despite all we have done in the past, we still have miles to go to understand and obey that which we have been given.<br><br>Let me give you a few examples of recent studies that illustrate what I mean about how our appreciation for the Book of Mormon is still growing.<br><h2><b>An Astonishing Achievement</b></h2><br>First, some history--the year 1829. Only recently have I come to appreciate what a staggering achievement it was for Joseph Smith to bring forth the Book of Mormon at all. The mere fact that it exists is more of a miracle than many of us realize. Consider, for example, the simple question of how long it took Joseph to translate the Book of Mormon. Many solid and independent historical documents written by people like Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph Knight, David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and even public records like the mortgage on Martin Harris' farm, thoroughly corroborate the details and reveal an amazing story. After the setbacks of 1828, the translation of the Book of Mormon finally began on April 7, 1829, two days after Oliver Cowdery arrived in Harmony, Pennsylvania, guided by a personal revelation from the Lord to come and serve as Joseph's scribe. A short five weeks later, by May 15, they had already reached the account of Christ's ministry among the Nephites in 3 Nephi 11. By June 11, we know they had translated the last of the plates of Mormon, for Joseph used the words from the title page as the legal description on the copyright application he filed that day. By June 30, the job was finished at the Whitmer farmhouse in Fayette, New York. From start to finish--no more than eighty-five total days. But even from that must be subtracted some time and disruption when Joseph and Oliver moved the first week in June in a buckboard from Harmony to Fayette, some 120 miles away; time for trips to Colesville for supplies (sixty miles round trip); time to receive and record thirteen sections now contained in the Doctrine and Covenants; time to restore the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods; time to convert and baptize Samuel and Hyrum Smith and several others; time to experience manifestations with the three and the eight witnesses; and I suppose a little time to eat and sleep. (For a full discussion, see John W. Welch and Tim Rathbone, "The Translation of the Book of Mormon: Basic Historical Information," F.A.R.M.S. W&amp;amp;R–86; John W. Welch, "How Long Did It Take Joseph Smith to Translate the Book of Mormon?"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1988, pp. 46–47)<br><br>This leaves only about sixty to sixty-five days on which the Prophet could have worked on the translation--that's about the length of this spring term. This works out to a phenomenal average of eight or nine finished pages per day--day in, day out. Only a week to produce 1 Nephi, with all its subtle religious and cultural baggage that Hugh Nibley has taken volumes to unpack! (see Hugh Nibley,<i>Lehi in the Desert, The World of the Jaredites, There Were Jaredites; An Approach to the Book of Mormon; Since Cumorah</i>[Deseret Book (Salt Lake City, Utah) and F.A.R.M.S. (Provo, Utah), 1988]; volumes 5, 6, and 7 of<i>The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley</i>)<br><br>It took a day and a half to translate King Benjamin's speech, one of the most masterful texts anywhere in religious literature. Besides teaching doctrines about the Atonement, service, humility, conversion, and covenants, the speech also reflects ancient Israelite piety infused with the true gospel of Jesus Christ! Yet there was no time for Joseph to consult at libraries (even if there had been a library in Harmony, Pennsylvania--which there was not). There was no time to study the Mishnah to find out how, in fact, Israelite kings delivered covenant renewal speeches, like Benjamin's, from towers to their people, who gathered by families in tents around their temple (see John W. Welch, "King Benjamin's Speech in the Context of Ancient Israelite Festivals," F.A.R.M.S. Wel–85c). There was no time to revise and refine, no time to cross-check entangled dates and interwoven details. Instead, the text came, as Oliver recorded five years later, "day after day . . . , uninterrupted," as the words fell "from his mouth" (see JS--H 1:71n).<br><br>Seeing this has brought home to me the magnificence of the text of the Book of Mormon. This was an astonishing achievement. The text came one time through, the final copy was dictated. And thus it has stood, except for minor stylistic editing, to this day. As a lawyer, I know what it is to dictate. After years of practice, I still cannot count on dictating anything perfectly the first time.<br><h2><b>Matters of Law</b></h2><br>Take a second case--from antiquity. As a lawyer, I have been fascinated and impressed with the technical sophistication of the Book of Mormon in ancient legal affairs. Whoever wrote the Book of Mormon had intimate familiarity with a completely consistent, operating legal system, grounded in the jurisprudence and legal terminology of ancient Israel. This is especially true of Alma, who after all was the chief judge. The reports on the trials of Abinadi, Nehor, and Korihor turn out to be remarkable legal documents in light of what we know about the ancient laws regarding reviling, false witnessing, blaspheming, murdering, heralding the results of an infamous conviction, and so on.<br><br>Law was of great importance to the Nephites, as it was for Israelites in general. It is hard for us to imagine the Israelite commitment to teaching, learning, and living the law. They loved the law. On festival days they venerated the law, parading their law books around the city. By comparison, imagine what would happen if we were to parade a copy of the Internal Revenue Code at one of our celebrations! Thus it is significant that Alma says the Nephites were<i>strict</i>in observing the law of Moses (Alma 30:3), which they were, down to the coming of Christ. Nephi also says that they kept "the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord<i>in all things, according to the law of Moses"</i>(2 Nephi 5:10; emphasis added)--"in all things" would mean in their civil and criminal matters as well as religious.<br><br>How true this was can be seen by such things as the following. It turns out there was a big difference under the law of Moses, and in ancient Near Eastern criminal law generally, between being a "thief" and being a "robber." (Discussed in John W. Welch, "Theft and Robbery in the Book of Mormon and Ancient Near Eastern Law," F.A.R.M.S. Wel-85a; summarized in "New Developments in Book of Mormon Research,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 1988, p. 12. See also Bernard Jackson,<i>Theft in Early Jewish Law</i>[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975].) A thief was an inside member of the community; he usually worked alone, and he stole things like chickens at night. A thief's criminal offense was not serious, and he was punished lightly, usually being required to return double that which he had stolen. A robber, on the other hand, was an outsider, literally an outlaw, living outside the community and outside the protection and rights of local law. Robbers hid out in the hills in bands, swearing oaths of secrecy and swooping down on villages, openly assassinating and plundering. Robbers were one of the greatest scourges of ancient civilization; sometimes in Egypt they occupied whole cities. Soldiers were sent out after them, and when they were caught, they were put to death on the spot--no trials were necessary.<br><br>This kind of information turns out to be significant in understanding the Book of Mormon, for it, too, observes this distinction. The Gadianton robbers are always called robbers, never thieves. They live out in the hills, and the army goes out to battle against them. When the Nephites catch one of the robbers, as in the case of Zemnarihah in 3 Nephi 4, they put him to death on the spot. No trial is mentioned, and they hang him on a tree and ritually chop the tree down (a form of notorious execution that indeed has a remarkable parallel in another obscure corner of Jewish law that oddly requires that the tree from which the culprit is hung be chopped down). (see Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin VI.6; and Maimonides, Sanhedrin XV.9) Indeed, the Hebrew word for bandit (<i>gedud</i>) may even have some connection with the name<i>Gaddianton,</i>especially since that name, like the Hebrew<i>gedud,</i>was spelled in the original Book of Mormon manuscript with a double<i>d.</i><br><br>Now we can also better understand why Laman was so frightened by Laban's threat. When Laman tried to obtain the plates of brass, you recall, Laban threw him out, saying, "Thou art a robber, and I will slay thee" (1 Nephi 3:13). Indeed, Laban was a military officer. If he chose to characterize Laman as a robber (and although he was not one, he was the son of Lehi, a wanted man who was now living out in the hills), Laban had the power to put some real teeth into his threat! Of course, if the text had said, "Thou art a<i>thief,</i>and I will slay thee," it wouldn't have sounded quite right. But that too is a telling point, for there is little substantive distinction between "theft" and "robbery" in Anglo-American law; nor could Joseph have learned the ancient distinction from his Bible, for the translators of the King James Version use these two words indiscriminately and interchangeably. For example, in the story of the Good Samaritan, the King James Version says that a man went down from Jerusalem and fell among "thieves" (Luke 10:30)! Of course, you do not fall among "thieves" out in the desert, but among "robbers," which is how the Greek reads. Unlike the King James Version, however, the Book of Mormon uses these two terms correctly.<br><h2><b>A Literary Accomplishment</b></h2><br>Third, consider something from the world of literature. I first became aware of the remarkable precision of the Book of Mormon when I was serving a mission in south Germany. There, twenty years ago, I was introduced at a lecture in a Catholic seminary to the idea of chiasmus in the Bible. Chiasmus is a variety of parallelism.that was frequently used in the ancient Near East literature, especially in Hebrew, although not exclusively. Instead of simply saying something twice in direct parallel form (a-b-c--a-b-c), a chiastic text repeats itself the second time in the opposite order (a-b-c--c-b-a). A good example of this is in Leviticus 24, where the three elements "killeth any man," "killeth a beast," and "cause a blemish" appear first in that order and then are repeated in reverse order, framing the talionic justice formula "eye for eye, tooth for tooth" (Leviticus 24:17–21).<br><br>Since chiasmus is a rather distinctive, recently detected mode of expression that often helps in analyzing biblical texts, I was excited, early one morning to discover that several writers in the Book of Mormon also employed this stylistic device. As it turns out, some of the most meaningful and well-constructed examples of this form of writing found anywhere in the world appear in the pages of the Book of Mormon (John W. Welch, "Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon,"<i>BYU Studies</i>[1969]; also in<i>New Era,</i>February 1972, and reprinted in Noel Reynolds,<i>Book of Mormon Authorship</i>[Provo, Utah: BYU Religious Studies Center, 1982]; see also John W. Welch, ed.,<i>Chiasmus in Antiquity</i>[Hildesheim: Gersterberg, 1981]).<br><br>A fine example of chiasmus is in Mosiah 5:10–12, where the six elements "name, called, left hand, remember, blotted out, and transgression" appear first in that order, and then reappear in the opposite order. Another creative example is in Alma 41:13–15. As in Leviticus 24, chiasmus is used brilliantly here to depict the reciprocal aspect of restorative justice. And nothing surpasses the chiastic composition of Alma 36, where Alma places at the pivot point of his intricately balanced chapter the central spiritual turning point of his entire life--namely, the point at which he called upon Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to atone for his sins. Alma could have drawn on no better literary expression to place Christ more squarely at the middle of things than chiasmus.<br><h2><b>Lessons Yet to be Learned</b></h2><br>Finally, consider some more practical and spiritual kinds of lessons we have yet to learn from the Book of Mormon. As bishop of a BYU student ward, I found over and over that answers to spiritual struggles were there to be found in the Book of Mormon, but they did not sink in until we had prayerfully searched the scriptures to obtain an answer to our needs.<br><br>For example, I had one member in my ward who could not feel completely forgiven, even though she had sincerely tried. It occurred to us how Benjamin had counseled and commanded his people that they must impart of their substance to the poor in order to<i>retain</i>a remission of their sins from day to day (Mosiah 4:26). This turned out to be the answer. Giving offerings to the poor has long been a part of holy Israelite fast days on which they sought atonement for their sins. Perhaps here is a lesson we all should learn, a forgotten step in the repentance process, to remember the poor and the needy.<br><br>On other occasions, I counseled members of my ward who were struggling with temptation to pray more effectively by pleading with the Lord to help them overcome what was tempting them. I learned this lesson, too, from the Book of Mormon, for it says that the righteous Nephites offered up a prayer every day "that they might not enter into temptation" (Alma 31:10). When was the last time you asked your Heavenly Father that you not be influenced by such and such a temptation?<br><br>Or again, have we really comprehended how the devil operates? Lehi's vision of the great and spacious building, for example, tells us graphically that the one main weapon used by the wicked is mocking and derision. I don't think we guard<i>ourselves</i>enough against behaving this way. Yet when you know your opponent's playbook, it's a lot easier to plan your defense. No better exposé of the cunning but rakish ways of the devil can be found than in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Or again, have we really noticed what Alma actually says about planting that seed of faith in Alma 32? What is it that he tells us we will know when the seed begins to grow? Do we know that the seed is "true"? Well, for Alma, it says we will begin to know that the seed is "good" (Alma 32:30–33, 36). Now there is an important difference between knowing that something is "true" and knowing that it is "good." Satan, for example, knows much that is true, yet he knows little of the good. We must know both. How great it is to know not only that the gospel and the Book of Mormon are true, but also that they are good!<br><br>This list could go on and on, but consider one more. There are lessons yet to be learned about making and keeping our covenants. When Jesus had but a few days to spend with the righteous people at Bountiful, what did he spend his time saying and doing? Just a few months ago, it dawned on me that in 3 Nephi 11 he met them at the temple, where he entered into covenants with them. It began with a great Hosanna Shout (3 Nephi 11:17), with instructions about baptism and priesthood ordinations (11:18–28). He told them how they were to make the covenant. If any of them had hard feelings toward another, Jesus told them they should go and reconcile themselves and then come unto Christ at the altar (12:23–24). There their oaths were to be sworn simply by saying "yes" or "no" (12:37). This was serious, sacred business. If anyone wrongly disclosed these holy things to the unworthy, Jesus told them they would be torn and trampled (14:6).<br><br>In 3 Nephi 12 and 13, Christ gave the people a series of commandments that they then agreed to obey. They were the new laws of sacrifice (the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit) and of obedience (12:19–20), of proper conduct toward brethren (no derision, no anger, no ridicule) (12:22), of chastity (12:28), of loving your enemies (12:44), of prayer (13:5–13), and of consecration (for a man cannot serve both God and mammon) (13:19–24).<br><br>In the end he promised them that those who know and do these things will be allowed at the last day to enter into the celestial kingdom. But others who have not so known the Lord will not be allowed to enter (14:21–23).<br><br>All this was taught as Jesus prepared these people to make covenants at the temple, to keep these commandments, to take upon them his name, and to remember his marked body he had just shown them and that they had received and touched with their own hands.<br><br>If Jesus had but a short time to spend with these people and chose to spend it with them at the temple, shouldn't we spend a little more of our time there as well?<br><h2><b>By Study and Also by Faith</b></h2><br>Well, why have I told you these things? There are several reasons. First, because I find them exciting. I never cease to be amazed by the Book of Mormon. The chiastic passages of the Book of Mormon, for example, are so obvious once they are pointed out, I wonder how Mark Twain could have missed them. Seeing the covenant-making context of Jesus' sermon at the temple is so plain and precious to me, I wonder why I hadn't focused on it before. The Lord has said the Book of Mormon contains the "fulness of the gospel" (D&amp;amp;C 20:9). That statement is truer than we realize. Sealed away in its pages, I know, are many lessons yet to be learned and many things yet to be discovered.<br><br>I also tell you these things because I know them to be good and true. One of the stated purposes of the Book of Mormon is to be a<i>convincing</i>witness that Jesus is the Christ. Its purpose is to<i>convince</i>Jew, Lamanite, and Gentile. Recognizing that all evidence must be evaluated carefully, I find the accumulation of points like these to be quite persuasive and indeed convincing that this book bears a true witness that Jesus is the Christ.<br><br>Does this mean I am trying to<i>prove</i>that the Book of Mormon is true? That question is often asked, but not often enough thought about. In this regard, I like what Church historian B. H. Roberts said in 1909:<br><br>[The Holy Ghost]<i>must ever be the chief source of evidence for the truth of the Book of Mormon. All other evidence is secondary to this, the primary and infallible. No arrangement of evidence, however skillfully ordered; no argument, however adroitly made, can ever take</i>[the]<i>place</i>[of the Holy Ghost].<br><br>However, he continued:<br><br><i>Secondary evidences in support of truth, like secondary causes in natural phenomena, may be of first rate importance, and mighty factors in the achievement of God's purposes.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>New Witnesses for God,</i>vol. 2 (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1909), pp. vi–viii]<br><br>I believe that historical documents from 1829, legal distinctions between theft and robbery, and other such studies give us just this kind of first-rate secondary evidence. They help us appreciate the miraculous origins of the Book of Mormon, the complexity of the legal and literary systems embedded in the text, and the profundity of its doctrines. This is no simple book dashed off from the top of any young man's head; it reflects the best of a thousand years of civilization and inspiration.<br><br>Of course, the Book of Mormon remains a debatable subject--and fortunately the Lord has left it primarily in the realm of faith. Not every question will be answerable to everyone's complete satisfaction, but when has that ever been the case with the Bible, with mathematics, or with anything else? Still, God has not left us without ample positive reasons that will lead the teachable, inquiring mind to the point of faith.<br><br>I have also said these things to show, that many approaches will be necessary to fathom the depths of the Book of Mormon. Historical, doctrinal, theoretical, practical, religious, legal, literary, intellectual, and spiritual approaches are all needed. President Benson has said that not only should we know what history the Book of Mormon contains, but we should understand its teachings. "God expects us to use the Book of Mormon in several ways" (Ezra Taft Benson, "The Book of Mormon Is the Word of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1988, p. 3).<br><br>The book has many stated purposes. They will demand the best of all our faculties.<br><br>The approaches I have sampled give only a glimpse of the range of work being done today by many people on our campus: Hugh Nibley, on the book's ancient cultural patterns and their modern implications; John Sorenson, on the limited geography internally required by the book itself; Robert Matthews and Monte Nyman, who have a great interest in the book and contemporary Mormonism; Stephen Ricks, Dan Peterson, and Stephen Robinson, working on Hebraic, Arabic, and early Christian comparisons; Bob Millett and Joseph McConkie, exploring its doctrinal meanings and significance; Noel Reynolds, reading 1 Nephi through a political perspective legitimating Nephi as Lehi's political successor; Roger Keller, adding a second contribution this year to computer-aided authorship analyses; Paul Hoskisson, seeking possible etymologies for Book of Mormon proper names; and many others.<br><br>Each approaches the Book of Mormon differently, which helps me see the incompleteness of my own knowledge. As the Apostle Paul said, we only "see through a glass, darkly," our knowledge is incomplete, we only "know in part," and we even prophesy only "in part" (1 Corinthians 13:9, 12). Similarly, President Benson has said that we must never rest in our study of the Book of Mormon. It will wear us out long before we will ever wear it out.<br><br><i>Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Otherwise, he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life.</i>[Benson, "The Book of Mormon Is the Word of God," p. 5]<br><br>Note well what President Benson says here: "Spiritual<i>and</i>intellectual unity to your whole life." Another reason I have told you these things is because I think they are the kinds of things that may help us to achieve the spiritual and intellectual unity President Benson is talking about. There is a verse from the Doctrine and Covenants on a plaque in the Lee Library. It's in the stairwell going up from the circulation desk to the fourth floor. As a student here in the sixties, I saw it several times every day; it made a deep impression on me. It admonishes us to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Spirit and intellect, study and faith, science and religion, testimony and academics--often we see these as opposites, but ultimately they are not. If our eye is single to God and his glory, if in our learning we are always willing to hearken unto the counsels of the Lord, if we are equally rigorous about what we think and how we reason, we shall see how all truth may be circumscribed in one great whole and, that all things shall work together for our good.<br><br>Scholarly tools can be used in learning more about the scriptures. Here, too, we must be, as the Greek reads, "as<i>astute</i>as serpents but as<i>pure</i>as doves" [<i>phronimoi, akeraioi</i>] (Matthew 10:16). Any tool can be used for good or for evil. A hammer can be used to build up or to tear down. It can even injure the careless or unskillful person who is trying to use it. But for that reason alone, we do not eschew all hammers. All tools must be used carefully, with training, and for their intended purposes. Everyone must be cautious not to exceed these bounds. We must all temper enthusiasm with competence and zeal with knowledge, but also we must temper our premises with inspiration and scholarly assertions with humility.<br><br>But given the right tools used in the right ways, we can do some great things. The Book of Mormon remains a book sealed by many seals. Proper tools and methods will unlock more and more of them and of its fullness to us. It is sealed to us by our unfaithfulness and lack of prayer. It is sealed to us by our inattention to detail and background information. It is sealed to us in part by its nature because it is an abridgment. It is sealed further by our failure to listen to the Brethren and to apply the teachings of the Book of Mormon to ourselves daily. It is sealed when we take its divine origins and simple elegance lightly. It is sealed when we fail to see the people of the book as they saw themselves. It is sealed when we don't blank out<i>our</i>eyes and when we don't stop hearing what<i>we</i>want to hear. We must sit back and let the Book of Mormon speak to us, instead of us to it. Now the book is supposed to speak from the dust; that doesn't mean the dust of our bookshelves. All this will take tremendous effort. But the promised rewards are more than worth it.<br><br>Sooner or later the Book of Mormon will be unsealed in your life. In the last days, Isaiah says, this book will not be a sealed book. Finally, "in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness" (Isaiah 29:18). Then, he says, shall the meek increase their joy and the scorners shall be consumed (Isaiah 29:19–20). This will happen, Isaiah says, when they that have erred shall come to<i>understanding,</i>and they that have murmured shall learn<i>doctrine</i>(Isaiah 29:24). Both will be required: correct understanding and devotion to doctrine.<br><br>At the final judgment we will also see these words again. The books of life will be unsealed, and all things shall be made manifest, whether they be good or whether they be evil. The words of the Book of Mormon will figure prominently on that day, for they are the words by which you and I will be judged. As God has spoken it, these words will stand as a bright testimony at the judgment (Mosiah 3:23–24, Moroni 10:27). We hope that day will not be the first time the Book of Mormon is truly unsealed and laid opened before us.<br><br>I testify that the Lord has given us a truly marvelous blessing in the form of the Book of Mormon. He and his servants, the prophets, have given much so we could have it. I pray the Lord will bless us all to love and to know him and this marvelous book, with all of our hearts and might, minds and strength, that we may thereby come to eternal life. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John W. Welch was a professor of law at BYU when this devotional address was given on 10 May 1988.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>from the Master - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am pleased to share with you the fact that the kingdom of our Heavenly Father rolls forward--not without challenges, not without hurdles, and not without the efforts of others to thwart or impede the progress of the Church.<br><h2><b>Bringing a Message</b></h2><br>What a thrill it was last Thursday in the Salt Lake Temple to be on hand when President Howard W. Hunter was set apart as President of the Council of the Twelve and to have the members of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve place their hands upon his head with President Benson being the voice. What a joy it was to be there on that occasion and feel of the Spirit and the love for this great man, President Howard W. Hunter--who at the present time is without his mobility but has a sweet spirit and an alert mind. He's a quorum president that I love, and I not only bring President Benson's love to you tonight, but also President Howard W. Hunter's.<br><br>Last Thursday I was impressed with the fact that while we conducted our normal business activities and cleared our agenda, trying to handle some of the affairs in our Heavenly Father's kingdom, President Benson said a number of times, "Thank God for good people." In a day and age when it's disturbing to read and hear about the activities of people who are leaning in the direction of misconduct and mistrust, I bring you that message from our prophet as he met with his counselors and those in the Council of the Twelve: Thank God for good people. I feel the same way about you. I thank God for you and for what you do. I encourage all of us to be positive and appreciate the good and the good people around us.<br><h2><b>Lessons of Love</b></h2><br>Let me now read a favorite scripture and ask you to remember it so we can refer to it later. You're all familiar with it, but you will never be as familiar with it as I would like you to be.<br><br><i>Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives.</i><br><br><i>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</i><br><br><i>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</i><br><br><i>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</i><br><br><i>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</i><br><br><i>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</i><br><br><i>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</i><br><br><i>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</i><br><br><i>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</i><br><br><i>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</i><br><br><i>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</i><br><br><i>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</i>[John 8:1–12]<br><br>For as long as I can remember I've had a special love for Jesus Christ. I was taught he was the Son of the Living God. I was taught he was my friend, my teacher, and my strength. In years past, when the calling and responsibility and honor of bearing special witness of him have come into my life, I have endeavored to be taught by his life and his ways. Truly, he is the Master Teacher. To assist me in my labors and commitment, I have found myself turning frequently to the eighth chapter of John in the New Testament for strength, for guidance, and for example. If you please, let us walk through some of the verses to strengthen our lives and our relationships with Jesus. These lines and words help me to better understand him and give me the desire to do and be more like him.<br><br>The first word: Jesus. I love the word<i>Jesus.</i>I love Jesus of Nazareth. It troubles me when I hear this sacred name used in vain. Do not allow yourselves to speak the word Jesus without reverence. Even though it's the world's way today to use that name in exclamation, in failure, to get attention, to curse, let us not allow ourselves to use the name Jesus without reverence.<br><br>I like the second word. I learn from it that Jesus<i>went,</i>he wasn't carried. He wasn't picked up. He wasn't conveyed. He went. Self-motivated. Self-disciplined. I love that word<i>went.</i>He sought privacy, seclusion for meditation, even in the Mount of Olives where he could ponder and pray and prepare. Early in the morning he was about his father's business. President Ezra Taft Benson has always started early, too. He knows how to work and starts early. Early in his life he learned to pray, work, and study.<br><br>One early morning my telephone rang in the Church Office Building. I don't want to sound as if I'm boasting, but it was a little before seven in the morning. Some of us take a little longer to get in a day's work. And that familiar voice of President Spencer W. Kimball--weak, but powerful--said, "Marvin, could I come up to your office and see you?" And I said, "President Kimball, if you want to see me, I'll be right down." He said, "Would you do that?" (I could make a sermon on courtesy, but gather that from what I just said.) I was down in his office in thirty seconds. He handed me a letter. He said, "Would you read this and tell me what you think?" I suppose he's done this with a lot of us--asking for our opinion. My opinion isn't that special. I read it and said, "President Kimball, you might want to think about doing it this way." And, bless his heart, he said, "That's what I thought and that's what we'll do." I went back to my office and felt fear and trembling and uneasiness for the rest of the day.<br><br>Just two or three weeks ago, President Benson phoned early in the morning. His greeting was, "Marv, I knew you'd be there." Be early. Get a good start.<br><br>Jesus came<i>again.</i>It was a habit. It was a regular way of the day. A way of life. And all the people! He attracted people! All came. He was personable, wise, and kind. May I say for our encouragement and future patience in activities that<i>all</i>the people came. They were attracted to him, but not all were converted. Some remained enemies. Some remained bitter. Others were taught. We recall Luke's record--so very well done.<br><br><i>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man.</i>[Luke 2:52]<br><br>Following up again on the beautiful scripture I love so much and am inclined to use as a guideline for my personal use, Jesus sat down on their level. He didn't talk down. He didn't talk up. He spoke to them as friends.<br><br>The Master Teacher taught on the mount, along the road, in the marketplace, in a boat, or on the shores--wherever and whenever as he lived. Can we sit down when we teach and communicate? He sat down and taught them. He didn't threaten. He didn't scold. He didn't belittle. He humbly showed the way with parables, kindness, and great wisdom. Certainly he was not a scribe. He was the Son of God. He taught eye to eye, person to person, and heart to heart. He sat down.<br><br>May I recall, and some of you have heard this before--but may I repeat it? I had the opportunity of sitting down with the prophet once in an unusual circumstance. It is something I shall never forget. President Kimball called me one day and said, "I'd like to go to the Utah State Prison and visit for a limited time." Without going into detail, the thing I think that prompted his request and his motivation was something as simple as pure religion--going undefiled before God visiting the fatherless, the downtrodden, the weary, the prisoners. So we went to the Utah State Prison. He wanted to shake hands with a few, visit for a while, and then return to his office. When we arrived at the institution, the warden had arranged to have two prisoners in his office. There with President Kimball and the warden (just five of us with the door closed), I looked at these two criminals (and they looked the part) in silence. One was convicted of murder and the other of grand larceny. There they were in prison uniforms, looking at the floor. One was a member and the other a nonmember. The warden and I were sitting there waiting to see what President Kimball would do. What would he say? He could have said, "I'm sure ashamed of you two," "What did you do to get here?" "How many times have you been here before?"<br><br>President Kimball looked at the one. He hadn't even raised his eyes off the floor. President Kimball kept looking at him. Finally he looked up, and President Kimball said, "Tell me about your mother." This prisoner told President Kimball about his mother. And when that was over, President Kimball looked at the other one (who was now looking up from the floor) and asked, "What does your father do?" Will Elder Ashton ever forget that moment? Instead of "You big dummy, you should have known better than that," he said, "What does your father do?" The man told about his father, and it wasn't very good. I was taught by a prophet. I saw a prophet with a Christ-like approach.<br><br>Now, back to the scripture. They brought unto him the woman taken in adultery. These enemies who would disturb, embarrass, ridicule, and display their cunningness--they tried to trick him. They sat her in the midst as an exhibit, as a sinner, as someone unclean. He didn't flee from her presence. They called him "Master." I become a little emotional because I feel close to that situation where they approached him as "You who have all the answers, tell us." They probed. They were unreasonable. She was taken in adultery--in the very act. There was no doubt about her guilt. They were setting him up in what appeared to be an impossible situation. Moses' law says to stone her. "What sayest thou?" they asked, tempting him, trapping him--putting him in a no-win position.<br><br>Whatever he said, he would be accused of wrongdoing, wrong judgment. They were tempting him to see if they could get him to lose his patience and forget who he was. Stoning her would be cruel. Ignoring her would be wrong. Asking her to leave would be beneath him. He stooped down and wrote on the ground as though he heard them not (getting their attention and preparing everyone within earshot to be taught). We don't know what he wrote on the ground with his finger. For our purposes here today we'll say he was getting their attention while ignoring their cries for action and response. In your roles as leaders and students, having silent periods during interviews and counseling can be important. That silent period in this interview was so powerful. And while it was silent they continued asking. I can hear the questions of mischief: "C'mon, say something. We've got you. Are you afraid to answer?" But Jesus was in charge. Soon this would be evident, but the quiet period had to go on a little bit longer.<br><br>Jesus lifted up himself, in humble and meek majesty, and said these most powerful words: "He that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her." A perfect answer from a perfect person.<br><br>Today in our responsibilities, situations, and callings, we need to be reminded of this over and over again. In our dealings with all people, let him who is without sin be the first to criticize or find fault or belittle or be the first to stone someone's character. He stooped down and wrote on the ground. They heard what he said. They felt the impact of his silence of spirit while he said nothing. Convicted by their own conscience they left on their own, not driven away. They went out one by one--not to find stones, but to nurse their spiritual wounds.<br><br>He was left alone with the woman. I'm glad that's recorded. Some of us are inclined to avoid being with those who have fallen. They're beneath or below us. Left alone with the woman, he said, "Where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?" He was involving her in the interview and teaching at the same time. Jesus Christ took time to ask and to listen. Oh, if we could do more of that! Our answers would be so easy, so much improved.<br><br>I recall a few years ago we had a call from a stake president. He said, "I haven't been able to resolve this situation. Would you be good enough to help us?" We arranged a time and met with a young man from Brigham Young University--265 pounds, an all-conference tackle--and his mom and his dad. This young man was a sophomore with two more years of football to play. His mom thought it would be nice if he played football, but his dad wanted him to go on a mission. The more interviews there were, the more confusion there was. After the usual greetings, I looked at the mother by the side of this football player big enough to pull a plow and said, "Do I understand right that you favor your son's playing football?" She said, "Yes, I think I lean in that direction." I looked at the father and said, "Am I right in assuming you would like to have your son go on a mission at this time?" He said, "Yes, I lean in that direction." So I looked at the football player and said, "What would<i>you</i>like to do?" He said, "I'd like to go on a mission." I said, "Why don't you?" The interview was over and he went on a mission! I love those difficult situations! How much fun I could have had if I'd spent a half hour arguing about which comes first and when, how, and where.<br><br>The woman taken in adultery answered the Lord's question regarding her accusers by saying, "No man, Lord." And then this powerful declaration came: "Go, and sin no more." The Master was teaching in that day and also teaching in this very hour. His great message: Despise the sin, but love the sinner. I hope that can give us strength and confidence and a closer relationship to our Savior, Jesus Christ. Jesus did not condone adultery. He gave the woman love instead of an authoritative lecture. She and the accusers needed a lesson in love. The situation called for mercy and compassion. How rewarding it is to know that Jesus believed that man is greater than all of his sins. Is it any wonder he was referred to as the "Good Shepherd?" He loved all of his sheep whether they were strays, hungry, helpless, cold, or lost.<br><h2><b>Christ's Own Testimony</b></h2><br>At the conclusion of this great teaching experience, this lesson of love and compassion, is an important verse.<br><br><i>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</i>[John 8:12]<br><br>Let us follow his light. Let us refer often to these few words. I bear witness to you that they were preserved for the good of everyone within the sound of my voice. We shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br><br>Later on in this same chapter of John, in verse twenty-five, after the Pharisees had been with the Savior and were confounded, confused, impressed, and touched, they were heard to say, "Who art thou?" And his simple answer was "the same that I said unto you from the beginning."<br><br>Recall Peter's answer when Jesus asked, "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" The disciples replied, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets." Then Jesus asked, "But whom say<i>ye</i>that I am?" (Matthew 16:13–15; emphasis added).<br><br>I challenge you with that question tonight. Whom say<i>ye</i>that Jesus Christ is?<br><br><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</i>[Matthew 16:16–18]<br><br>Let us have our answer when the question comes to us or pops up in our minds: "Who art thou?" Let us know with each passing day who he is and live closer to him.<br><br>Another of my favorite verses is also in the eighth chapter of John. After this series of teachings and experiences, with people asking who he was and what his purpose was and trying to trick him and embarrass him, I suppose Jesus came to the point where he thought, What do I have left to say to them? My life and my ways don't seem to affect them. In verse twenty-six, at the climax of this story, Jesus said, "He that sent me is true" (John 8:26).<br><br>Jesus Christ was bearing his testimony that God is real and that his ways are true and right. I would like to have us remember that when we don't seem to have all the answers and we're not very effective in communicating the feelings of our hearts through words, we should go to the scriptures, where we have a powerful ally in testimony and testimony sharing. We may not have all of the answers yet. But I want you to know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true. And if nothing else seems to influence or affect you, remember that I have this testimony and I know it is true. A testimony is a priceless possession, and it's peculiar and valuable only in this great church of ours. Don't ever forget its importance. When all other channels seemed to be plugged with poison prejudice, Jesus bore his testimony.<br><h2><b>"If Ye Continue"</b></h2><br>God the Father has not left us alone. We have membership in the church of Jesus Christ. Do the things that please him, and you will have joy in him and in yourself.<br><br><i>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i>[John 8:31–32]<br><br>I love that word<i>continue.</i>If you continue, you are his disciple. Some missionaries--past and present--have felt that to be a disciple you have to be an assistant to the president or a zone leader or a senior companion. The truth is that all you have to do in missionary work or in life to be a disciple is to continue. I want you ladies to know that continuing is more important than earning the crown of human approval. All of us can continue. Not all of us may be called to positions of heavy and mighty responsibility. But it gives satisfaction to me--and I hope to you, too--to know that the final test is "are you continuing and will you continue?"<br><br>I was out with the missionaries last week. After we had had some discussions and presentations, we opened up a question-and-answer period. That's always a little fun and a little dangerous. One missionary said, "Did your patriarchal blessing say you were going to be an apostle?" I've been asked that question before, incidentally. Because I've been asked that before--and because I've put in proper perspective what the real blessings are, what it means to continue--I carry with me one little verse or paragraph from my patriarchal blessing. And I take satisfaction in repeating it here tonight with my sweetheart at my side. She's never heard me read this from my patriarchal blessing in public before. So brace yourself, Sister Ashton. I share this only to emphasize the fact that callings and offices are not as important as family, and continuing, and love, and compatibility.<br><br><i>I also bless thee, Brother Ashton, through prayer and humility of heart thou shalt be provided with a companion in life whose heart and spirit shall be in harmony with thine, and that together you will provide a home that shall be a place of safety, a haven of rest, a sanctuary wherein the spirit of the gospel and the spirit of love shall remain supreme.</i><br><br>I'm so glad that blessing was pronounced and made available to me for ratification if I lived worthily for it. The family, the home, the continuing make us disciples--not titles or honors.<br><br>Not only do I know Jesus Christ as the Master Teacher, our Redeemer, our Savior, and the Only Begotten of the Father--I know him in ways that touch my soul and give me daily direction. God lives. He is our father. He loves us. Jesus is the Christ. This is his church. Jesus is the light and the way. I leave you my blessing and thank you for being here tonight. I hope and pray that in some small way we can go forward from tonight with a closer association and appreciation for Jesus Christ. And I pray this in his name. Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.

<h1>Can Make a Difference - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am happy to be with you today, especially as you are beginning a new summer session of study at Brigham Young University. It is pleasing to me to see so many of my dear friends--President Holland, my family, and my mission family, who have come to lend their love and spiritual strength to me on this occasion.<br><br>This is a devotional assembly. It is a moment for each of us to think of heavenly things, of things that will build our spiritual strength and draw us closer to our Heavenly Father. I realize, in part, the responsibility that has been placed upon me. Therefore, I seek for the spirit of the Holy Ghost to be with me. And I pray that you, too, will sense my desire and let your faith and prayers be exercised in my behalf.<br><br>The famous Christian reformer, Billy Sunday, is quoted as having said that the secret to his success was that "He started a fire in himself and the people came to watch him burn." I feel that I have come with a fire in my heart, kindled by the love that I have for the Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that as the Spirit burns in me, this same Spirit will ignite a fire in you. "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together" (D&amp;amp;C 50:22).<br><h2><b>Because of One Man</b></h2><br>Some time ago, while laboring in the Lord's missionary service, a wonderful missionary came to see me. It was near the end of his mission. He was very depressed. Saddened by his own perception of personal success, he had imposed upon himself a standard from which he had fallen far short. As he spoke, he recounted for me the difficult time he had experienced in the MTC. While he was there, his father had died unexpectedly, and for a brief period of time the elder had considered leaving the mission and returning home. But, encouraged by a loving mother and spurred on by an individual commitment, he continued his training and finally found himself in the beautiful country of Bolivia.<br><br>I listened to him as he told me of the initial efforts he had made in his mission to work hard, pray often, follow all the rules, and be a model missionary--expecting, of course, to be rewarded with hundreds of baptisms. But, unfortunately, the baptisms had not come. Gradually he began to slacken his pace. He felt that his prayers were not being heard, so why pray? The mission rules seemed somehow to be burdensome. They were restrictive, silly things, written by the mission president only to goad and irritate him and the other missionaries.<br><br>In despair, he said, "And now I'm nobody! What I do won't make any difference!" Then searchingly, he quickly added, "Will it, President Hammond?"<br><br>For an instant the same questions passed through my own mind. "Can he make a difference? Can I? Can anyone? Does it matter what one man does?" Then, in my mind's eye I saw a myriad of people and events. I found myself talking eagerly and enthusiastically.<br><br>"Elder, do you remember a man named Copernicus?"<br><br>For more than a millennium men's ideas about the universe had been cemented in the theories of the Greeks, of Ptolemy and Aristotle. That is to say, the earth was the center of the universe. Even the Catholic church in the thirteenth century, influenced by St. Thomas Aquinas, had adopted the Aristotelian view that the earth lies right in the middle of the heavens. The dreaded Inquisition managed to silence any radical views that might have been expressed. Then, in A.D. 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a new truth: that the earth rotates daily on its axis and the planets revolve in orbits around the sun. Of this, Martin Luther is reputed to have said, "The fool wants to turn the whole science of astronomy upside down" ("Pioneers in Man's Search for the Universe,"<i>National Geographic</i>145, no. 5 [May 1974]:627). Copernicus did just that, and in so doing set astronomy free.<br><br>One man! And today we are awed into humility by the tremendous scope of the universe. Yes, we measure space by light-years, the distance light travels in one year at the rate of 186,282 miles a second. We know that galaxies are as common as blades of grass in a meadow--perhaps over a hundred billion of them. There are distant objects known as quasars, placed at ten billion light years away from the earth, that in one second throw out enough energy to supply all the earth's electrical needs for billions of years. And we know of neutron stars whose matter, if contained in a teaspoon, would weigh over a billion tons. The learning goes on and on because of "one man."<br><h2><b>Thousands Followed</b></h2><br>The elder seemed interested. For a moment he had forgotten himself and was listening intently. Therefore, I continued. I know of a man raised in India and educated in England as an attorney. He loved his native land and longed for the time that she would be free from the domination of Great Britain. Most of his life he lived in a mud hut that had no electric lights, no running water, no telephone. He didn't own an automobile, and he never sought or held a public office. By some he was thought to be the most Christ-like person who had ever lived, and yet he was not even a Christian. To India he was the "Mahatma" or "The Great Soul." He described himself as a "self-remade man."<br><br>When Britain was struggling for survival against the Axis powers during World War II, and some prominent Indian leaders wanted to revolt and throw off her authority, he said, "We will not steal even our independence." In his efforts to stop the continual fighting between India and Pakistan he often subjected himself to prolonged fasts. During one of those lengthy ordeals a medical doctor tried to get him to take a small portion of beef broth, to which he commented, "Even for life itself we may not do certain things. There is only one course open to me--to die, but never to break my pledge." And as they begged him to eat or drink, fearing for his life, for his kidneys had begun to fail, he simply said, "Life is more than science and God more than chemistry" (see Sterling W. Sill,<i>The Glory of the Sun</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1961], pp. 309–10).<br><br>Someone has said, "When Cicero speaks, the people say, 'How eloquent!' When Demosthenes speaks, the people say, 'Come, let us march!'" When this humble Indian went out from his house to walk, multitudes followed him. Thousands were willing to submit to death rather than take up arms against their enemies because he did not believe in violence, but rather in the principles of peace and love.<br><br>On 30 July 1948, as he hurried to the village prayer ground, blessing the people as he went, a religious fanatic shot and killed him. The Mahatma was gone. His name was Mohandas K. Gandhi. Only one man! Yet through his efforts, India was granted her freedom. The name<i>Gandhi</i>will live on forever--in the annals of time.<br><h2><b>"In the Hands of Man"</b></h2><br>"You see, Elder, there are men who have truly made a difference."<br><br>Yet we must use prudence in our study, for it is possible that evil men can also have a lasting effect upon their fellow beings. A demented Austrian with a view of total world control used his evil genius to disrupt the whole earth. Plunging the civilized world into war, his powerful armies created havoc throughout all of Europe. His regime left behind a path of death and destruction that had few equals in the history of the world. His racial myth of Aryan supremacy was responsible for the mass murder of over six million Jews and many more millions of members of other races, supposedly "inferior" to the Germans. The names of the death camps of Dachau, Buchenwald, and others will long be remembered as horrible proof of the depth of depravity to which supposedly civilized countries may descend. Such atrocities were instigated by one man, Adolf Hitler, who caused himself to be called simply "Der Führer." In a pamphlet written of the tragedy of Dachau, the author said, "Man cannot trust himself in the hands of man" (pamphlet distributed at Dachau).<br><br>Truly a man may make a difference, but if he is not guided by the Holy Spirit, but rather by the evil one, he may jeopardize all that is sacred in this life and in the life to come.<br><h2><b>More Than Any Other Man</b></h2><br>The elder sat quietly. Hardly moving. Not speaking. "Are you beginning to understand?" I asked him pointedly.<br><br>"I believe I am," he responded. "But, please, don't stop now, President. Go on!" I thought for a moment and then continued.<br><br>"Very well. There are two others I would like to tell you about."<br><br>On 23 December 1805, a baby boy was born to Joseph and Lucy Smith. They named him after his father. As he grew and developed in mind and in body, schooled in godly principles by his devoted parents, his inquisitive mind sought for religious truth. In response to his humble pleading, the most glorious manifestation ever given to man appeared before him. He saw the living God and Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son. Acting upon their admonitions, one boy (one man) began the incredible task of preparing a way to preach the restored gospel of salvation to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 133:37).<br><br>Progress was slow. The translation of sacred records into the Book of Mormon required considerable time and great effort. There were persecutions, killings--every possible delaying tactic conceivable was employed by Satan to stop the work. Still, "having put his hand to the plough" (Luke 9:62), he did not look back. Many followed him. They were driven from place to place. Finding no rest from their tribulations, they relied only on his leadership and their implicit faith in the Savior of Men.<br><br>When he was only thirty-nine years old, a bloodthirsty mob stormed a jail in Carthage, Illinois, where he had been imprisoned unjustly, shooting and killing him and his brother Hyrum. His murderers believed that in this way they would stop the work Joseph had begun. But the work did not stop, for it is the work of God. Today, because of one man and his indomitable character for good, the truth is being proclaimed in much of the known world. Of him, Elder John Taylor has said,<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><h2><b>Because He First Loved Us</b></h2><br>"And now I come to the last, yet by far the most significant of all," I said to the young elder.<br><br>He was born a babe in Bethlehem of old and placed in a manger by his beautiful virgin mother, Mary. He was the firstborn son in the spirit world and the only begotten son of Eloheim in the flesh. As he grew, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). At the age of thirty he began his public ministry. To the ancient prophet Nephi, an angel said,<br><br><i>Look and behold the condescension of God!</i><br><br><i>And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken....</i><br><br><i>And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. ...</i><br><br><i>... And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits. ... And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</i><br><br><i>... And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.</i><br><br><i>And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.</i>[1 Nephi 11:26–33]<br><br>As a resurrected being he proclaimed to the Nephites, on this continent:<br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even</i>so<i>should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--</i><br><br><i>And for this cause have I been lifted up.</i>[3 Nephi 27:14–15]<br><br>All this was precipitated by one thing: his infinite love for all of God's children. The Apostle John said, "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). One man!--the Son of the Eternal God, who submitted himself to all of these things in order that we, you and I, might live again with the hope of eternal life.<br><h2><b>One Faithful Elder</b></h2><br>Now I spoke softly to the young missionary with all the fervor of my soul. I placed my hand on his and said, "Are you ready to go back out into the field of labor? Can you make a difference in the lives of these special Bolivian children of our Heavenly Father? Are you ready to once again 'take up your cross, follow [him], and feed [his] sheep?' (D&amp;amp;C 112:14).<br><br>It was apparent that his attitude had changed. With a renewed spirit of dedication, tears slipping down his face, he committed himself once again to the work of the Lord. We knelt in prayer together. I blessed him that he would be able to find the way.<br><br>Although he had been weak, I felt an inner confidence in him. As I sought to find direction from the Spirit for a new assignment for the elder, I surprised even myself by sending him to one of the most difficult and remote areas of Bolivia--a small community near the Argentine border named Bermejo. The work had gone badly there for some time, with only a few baptisms to reinforce the little handful of Saints who were discouraged and finding it hard to keep the faith.<br><br>But the Lord and his ways are wonderful to behold. In his weekly reports to me the missionary told of his diligent efforts to contact the people and preach the gospel to them. He indicated that they were slow to listen, but that he was continuing his faithful stewardship in that part of the Lord's vineyard. And then it happened!<br><br>Overnight a small river running near the village of Bermejo, fed by heavy rains in the mountains, rose to a height never before known in the history of the land. Homes were swept away; and people were drowned. The only bridge connecting the city to the main road was torn from its footings and washed downstream. Communications were destroyed. There was chaos everywhere. Two young missionaries were caught in the turmoil of death and destruction caused by the flooding waters. And one remembered that "a man can make a difference." He threw himself into the turbulent waters to rescue many who were drowning; he sought for those buried beneath fallen buildings; he gave relief to the injured and succor to the hungry.<br><br>And a miracle occurred! He became a hero. He was lauded by the newspapers. His name was spoken over the airwaves. The people mentioned his name with reverence. Those who had previously rejected him and the message he carried now searched him out. Their doors were opened to receive him. They loved him! They accepted his burning testimony of Jesus Christ and the gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. In the few months that remained of his mission he brought scores of wonderful people into the Church. He saw the men receive the holy priesthood and their wives become more lovely in Relief Society activity. Today a beautiful chapel stands in Bermejo. On the Sabbath day it is full of people who still remember one faithful elder who made a difference.<br><h2><b>What Difference Will You Make</b></h2><br>And now, just for a moment: What can<i>you</i>do to make a difference? Each one of those about whom I have spoken paid a price for his remarkable achievements. It seems there is always a price! May I suggest a few methods that will start you on the road to making a difference.<br><br>First, attend all three of your Sabbath-day meetings--without fail! Then you will be instructed in principle and truth. You will be reminded of sacred baptismal covenants as you take the Lord's sacrament.<br><br>Second, pay your tithing and your offerings faithfully. Then you will begin to understand the purpose for the law of sacrifice and the law of consecration.<br><br>Third, maintain a resolute firmness in keeping the law of chastity. Then you will be a pure vessel where darkness is removed and where light remains.<br><br>Fourth, when you are prepared, go to the Lord's house. There you will be taught in the ways of godliness and be prepared to receive a fullness of the priesthood.<br><br>Fifth, preach the everlasting gospel in word and deed. Then you will share in the joy of a converted soul--you will understand true joy. And you will win the crown of eternal life.<br><br>And what difference will you make? The kingdom of God will be strengthened by your membership. Your character will become as strong as steel. You will be a source of spiritual wisdom and strength to many. And God will love you!<br><br>As I look at you, children of Israel, I see the light of truth glowing in your eyes. I know that your desires are good. I pray that you will remember the lives of such great men as Copernicus and Gandhi, that you will not forget what evils can be wrought by men such as Adolph Hitler. I beseech you to think often of Joseph Smith and how his life has affected your own. I humbly remind you of the only pure, sinless life ever lived on this earth, that of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I sincerely confess to you my love for him, I witness that he lives and that he loves us. Seek for him! Be like him! He is the Way, the Light, and the Life. And when you find him, you, too, will make a difference. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>F.

<h1> Neighbor: The Great Commandments - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
If you were asked the question "What element of Christ's life or attribute of his character or part of his ministry best represents to you his majesty and personal relationship with us," what would your answer be? I am going to talk specifically about one potential answer. It is the answer I have been thinking about for some time; it would likely be my answer to the question.<br><br>I am going to lay a foundation by presenting to you a few ideas I have carefully considered. I hope they will have appropriate inspiration for you in your hearts. I have been thinking about speaking on this subject at this school for a long time because I have had very strong feelings about it and, of course, for this school and you who attend it. But I have not done so--intimidated, perhaps, by the supposition that so important a theme has already been sufficiently treated, or that it surely should and would be by those more qualified to address it.<br><br>I have also had the recurrent remembrance of a college experience to deal with, and I confess that worries me even now. I had carefully prepared and presented quite well, I thought, a briefing of a consequential case in an important course, and then awaited the response of the learned professor and several students previously assigned to critique my efforts. I had the feeling that all were poised somewhat in the fashion of runners straining at the blocks waiting for the starter's gun.<br><br>But it was not of the students that I was most apprehensive. The dean of the school, who was teaching that class, had earned a reputation as a crusty and vigorous defender of the law, against ignorant and callow students. His brief comment came soon enough to my anxious ear: "Thank you, Mr. Hanks," he said, "for that thoroughly unnecessary delineation of the obvious." The class then undertook to consider the deeper meaning of the matter at hand.<br><br>So basic is this subject today, and so widely discussed and written of and so generally thought to be believed and understood already, that there may be those present less charitable than others who may be tempted to murmur when I am through, "That was an unnecessary delineation of the obvious."<br><br>Nonetheless, I undertake the challenge of speaking about the "great commandments" and, specifically, though they are inseparable, about the second great commandment. The Apostle James called it the "royal law." Paul told the Galatians that "<i>all the law</i>is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Galatians 5:14; emphasis added).<br><h2><b>Love the Lord and Love thy Neighbor</b></h2><br>There are fundamentals of our faith so essential to our ultimate creative opportunities, possibilities, and associations that we call them first principles and ordinances. Perhaps not all of us are inclined to consider loving and serving and giving to our fellowmen among them. Yet the Savior of mankind thought they were critical, as manifested in his totally unselfish life and in his teachings.<br><br>When Christ was asked by a contentious lawyer, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" (Matthew 22:36)--or, as another gospel writer reported it, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" (Luke 10:25)--he answered, as Matthew recorded it,<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i>[Matthew 22:37–39]<br><br>In Luke's version, Jesus then asked the questioner what the old law said in answer to his own question. Quoting from the books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, the man answered just as Jesus had answered. From Deuteronomy 6:5: "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." From Leviticus 19:18: "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." In Matthew's account the Savior added these words: "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matthew 22:40).<br><br>Luke's gospel then provides the setting for Christ's sobering parable of the Good Samaritan by quoting the lawyer asking Christ, "And who is my neighbour?" (Luke 10:29). Out of this powerful story known to all of you--this story of a traveler from Jerusalem to Jericho who was set upon, robbed, wounded, and left at the wayside by thieves--comes a basis for understanding who is the neighbor we are commanded to love and what our own status is as a neighbor to those in need.<br><br>You will remember that involved in the story were a priest (church leader or teacher) and a Levite (one of the tribe assigned to temple service). Both of them "passed by on the other side," neither stopping to help (see Luke 10:31–32). Both were preoccupied or too busy with important assignments. Or both were too unimpressed, perhaps, with the "weightier matters" of which Christ spoke. Christ joined mercy with just judgment and faith as the "weightier matters" with which we should be concerned (Matthew 23:23), and in this parable he defined mercy for us as the care and concern shown by the Samaritan who did not pass by on the other side but stopped to give immediate and sustained assistance.<br><br>Jesus then said to the questioner and to us, "Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37)<i>. Loving neighbor, mercy, giving, service, caring, sacrifice--</i>all are brought together in one compelling, understandable, and personally applicable example.<br><br>I hope we all can repeat what many people outside the Church who are committed to strong religious conviction can repeat: "For God<i>so loved</i>the world, that<i>he gave</i>his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16; emphasis added). It is written again that Christ "<i>so loved</i>the world that<i>he gave</i>his own life" (D&amp;amp;C 34:3; emphasis added) that we might become his spiritual sons and daughters. And it is again written,<br><br>Give,<i>and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Luke 6:38; emphasis added]<br><br>And again: "Ye are to be taught from on high," said the Lord in the latter times. "Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power, that<i>ye may give</i>even as I have spoken" (D&amp;amp;C 43:16; emphasis added).<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Principles</b></h2><br><i>Loving and giving.</i>God loved and gave. Christ loved and gave. We are here to learn how to love enough to get our minds off ourselves, at least sometimes. As a commitment to Christ and as an element of our religious faith, we must look for, seek for, and respond to the needs of those about us. As children of God, loving him, we have all his other children as our neighbors and we have the commandment to love them. We are neighbors to them; we are to show mercy. This royal law--this one word in which all the law is fulfilled, this companion law with love of God, on which all the law and prophets depend--is indispensable as a solid base upon which our eternal opportunities rest.<br><br>Now, these fundamental laws we speak of, obedience to which all blessings are predicated upon, are in nature really opportunities--gifts--since they open the way toward that spiritual maturity possessed in its fullness by our Father and our Lord and which they desire us to develop. These laws are not designed to limit us. They are the laws the scripture says "<i>also</i>maketh you free" (D&amp;amp;C 98:8)--coupled with the truth, which "shall make you free" (John 8:32). These laws are more inclusionary than exclusionary. The spirit of entitlement is in them as well as commandment. Gifts they are, bestowed to support us as a foundation, pointing us toward the ultimate development of our eternal potential.<br><br>But, you ask, is giving help, across the wide spectrum the scriptures teach us, really as important as those other first principles? Yes! And that I believe is the burden of my message and conviction. Yes, it is as important, as a principle! For all of these fundamentals relate to and include each other indivisibly, inseparably. Jesus so lived and so declared and so the scriptures teach.<br><br>We do not need an extensive rehearsal of what these first principles and ordinances are--only a line or two about each:<br><br><i>Without faith it is impossible to please</i>[God]:<i>for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</i>[Hebrews 11:6]<br><br>Justice will have its place, but mercy claimeth the penitent, and "none but the truly penitent are saved" (Alma 42:24).<br><br>"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God," and "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he [she] cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5).<br><br>Paul taught us (and our experience corroborates it fully) that the things of God can only be taught and only be understood through the Spirit of God. We have learned that affliction and tribulation are part of living mortally and that "Whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 36:3).<br><br>We know that there are other essential sacred ordinances available in sacred places for those who desire them. We know that nothing unclean can be received into the kingdom of God. Affirming these and other commandments, the principle we are thinking about tonight announces that our salvation and our happiness depend as much upon how we treat other human beings and help them meet their needs as it does upon the other great fundamentals. Indeed, this is the test of our understanding and internalizing of the other fundamentals. If through them we do not become more Christ-like, we have not felt the efficacy and power of those sacred principles and ordinances.<br><br>This principle is as important as missionary work and temple work, and, indeed, is of the same spirit and same significance--inseparable, I repeat, from the heart of that work. One signal verse of scripture gives promise to those who worthily experience the ordinances of the temple:<br><br><i>And that they may grow up in thee, and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized according to thy laws, and be prepared</i>to<i>obtain every needful thing.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 109:15]<br><br>What remarkable consequences are performed for obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel. All of them lead us to Christ and our Father in Heaven.<br><br>When Christ commanded his disciples to go into the world to teach and baptize, what else did he say? He told them to go out to all nations, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:20). And what would this include?<br><br>In his last three great summational parables recorded in chapter 25 of Matthew, Christ taught about the wise virgins who prepared themselves and about the virgins who did not. And then he taught about talents and their bestowal and their enjoyment and their application--or not--and the consequences of our choices. Then, in the third and one of the best known of his parables, he taught about a time when the king will return and separate the sheep on his right hand from the goats on his left. To those on his right the king will say,<br><br><i>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat.</i>[Matthew 25:34–35]<br><br>You know the rest of that special parable:<br><br><i>I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:35–36]<br><br>The modest people on the king's right hand will say, because they are honest or they would not be there, "Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?" (Matthew 25:37). They wanted more than anything to enjoy the blessing he was holding out to them, but they didn't really feel worthy. They didn't remember ever finding him hungry and feeding him, or thirsty and giving him drink, or naked and clothing him, or homeless and taking him into their homes, or sick or in prison and visiting him.<br><br>I pray all of you know the answer, and you should know it verbatim: "And the King shall ... say unto them, ... Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>But that isn't the end of the story. In the rest of the parable he said some harsh things to those on his left hand: "Depart from me ... into everlasting fire. ... For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat" (Matthew 25:41–42). And then he went through the whole litany. They were indignant: "Why are we here? Why aren't we on your right hand? When saw we thee an hungred? Why, Lord, we would have crawled from here to wherever to give you our last morsel, had we known it was you!"<br><br>Do you remember how he finished?<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</i><br><br><i>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</i>[Matthew 25:45–46]<br><br>These, the book says, did not "minister" to those to whom they were neighbors. They did not<i>minister</i>to those who were their neighbors.<br><br>Does this sound like an option to you, this second law interpreted in terms of our relationship with the way we treat others, the way we look upon them, the way we regard them, interpreted, as Jesus did, in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10)?<br><h2><b>Our Readiness to Meet the Lord</b></h2><br>Out of the Book of Mormon, this strong source of so much that is so good, I read from Alma where he establishes a series of questions as the standard by which we may judge our own readiness to meet the Lord. "If ye have experienced a change of heart [if you have ever felt it in your viscera, your eyes, or your backbone; if you have ever tasted it, sensed it, responded to it; if you have<i>ever</i>had this], I would ask, can ye feel so now? Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? ... [Have you] been sufficiently humble? ... Are ye stripped of pride? ... If ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God" (see Alma 5:26–28).<br><br><i>Is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? ... such an one is not prepared;...</i><br><br><i>And ... is there one among you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</i><br><br><i>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time</i>is<i>at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!</i>[Alma 5:29–31]<br><br>The specific and significant prophetic instructions in the teachings of the Lord on our responsibility to each other are so numerous and clear that it would seem beyond misunderstanding. And yet I wonder if in our own minds we have elevated to its holy significance this relationship established by that invitation and command: Love God and love your neighbor as yourself.<br><br>I have earnestly sought to understand what the scriptures teach about this matter. I believe and attest and testify that the way we treat each other and our fellowmen is as significant a criterion of our character and the quality of our faith and our future as any other principle or ordinance of the gospel. Repeatedly and unequivocally the Lord specifically points to our response to those who are poor, needy, afflicted, hungry, thirsty, naked, homeless, sick, and imprisoned, and also to those who have other needs.<br><br>In the days of serious struggle in the fledgling Church in June 1831, a conference was held in Kirtland, Ohio, at which significant priesthood matters were announced. Missionary emphasis was given and assignments were made, sending out the men two by two.<br><br><i>And let them journey from thence preaching the word by the way, saying none other things than that which the prophets and apostles have written, and that which is taught them by the Comforter through the prayer of faith.</i><br><br><i>Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands by the water's side.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 52:9–10]<br><br>This is a plain statement of fundamental first principle and ordinance. Note what is subsequently said in this same section. The place of ordinances is discussed. We often hear the greatest of emphasis given to<i>ordinances,</i>and so we should, but note the pairing of ordinances and personal preparation:<br><br><i>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit</i>is<i>contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</i><br><br><i>He that speaketh, whose spirit</i>is<i>contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 52:15–16]<br><br>There is no question about the significance of the ordinances. Then this plain and understandable declaration is made:<br><br><i>Let the residue of the elders watch over the churches, and declare the word in the regions round about them; and let them labor with their own hands....</i><br><br><i>And remember in all things the</i>poor<i>and the</i>needy,<i>the</i>sick<i>and the</i>afflicted,<i>for he that doeth not these things,</i>the same is not my disciple. [D&amp;amp;C 52:39–40; emphasis added]<br><br>The charity taught in the scriptures is defined as the pure love of Christ. It is very broad in its meaning, but it seems never better expressed to me than when we share with others in the spirit of his unselfish life--doing what good we can, giving, serving, sharing, listening, lifting the burden. "Bear ye one another's burdens," wrote the Apostle Paul, "and so fulfil the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2).<br><br>There is one magnificent summation out of a multitude that might be read that I want to share with you to express my understanding of the spiritual maturity the Lord represents and wants us to attain. It comes in the words of a solemn and stirring witness by Amulek as he testifies of Christ's atoning gift--the last great sacrifice, infinite and eternal. He referred to the great question in the people's minds--whether or not Christ was indeed the Son of God. Then he said, "And now behold, my beloved brethren, l say unto you, do not suppose that this is all" (Alma 34:28).<br><br>Amulek talked about the fundamentals, about exercising their "faith unto repentance," about prayer and all that it implies. Do you remember that long list of remarkable, repetitious, and yet fresh invitations? This is how it finishes. Surely every missionary would have this marked in his mind and his book:<br><br><i>And now behold, my beloved brethren</i>[and sisters]<i>, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold,</i>your prayer is in vain, and availeth you nothing,<i>and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if ye do not remember to be</i>charitable,<i>ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden underfoot of men.</i>[Alma 34:28–29; emphasis added]<br><br>Time does not permit me to share much more of the wealth of the scriptures at this time, but I urge you to be interested as you read for understanding. Think what the Lord has to say about our response to the needs of each other. His words are sobering, to say the least.<br><br><i>If any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the</i>poor<i>and the</i>needy,<i>he shall, with the wicked,</i>lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment. [D&amp;amp;C 104:18; emphasis added]<br><br>I presume that means whoever he is and whatever else he has done. "Behold, they have not learned to be obedient to the things which I required at their hands," he said to a group of his people who had a great commission and had not succeeded in it,<br><br><i>but</i>[they]<i>are full of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted among them;</i><br><br><i>And are not united...;</i><br><br><i>And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 105:3–5]<br><br>Apparently those laws include the very matters of which we speak.<br><br>There is a remarkable line out of a long and important passage in the great story of Mosiah about one who turns aside a beggar:<br><br><i>O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent</i>[taking the attitude that he has had his chance, he won't work, his problems are his own fault];<i>and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</i>[Mosiah 4:18]<br><br>That doesn't sound very optional, does it? After we have done all the good things we have been called to do with as much sincerity as we have to commit to the cause, if we do not take a lively interest in those who have special needs, then we do not meet the conditions.<br><br>We have mentioned only those fundamentals in the Savior's initial declaration which early in these few moments I pointed to as the heart of what I wanted to say. Christ talked of the hungry, thirsty, naked, homeless, sick, afflicted. There are many who have other needs. Look around you with your minds for a moment. Are there those who have need of a kind word or a gentle arm? Is there someone who could prosper from a little note that says something sincere and generous and encouraging?<br><h2><b>You Have Much to Give</b></h2><br>I will open very slightly the door to my modest closet of remembered personal experiences of this kind and tell you about a time when I was a missionary standing on a street corner in a major city in the United States with my companion, without a cent in our pockets. We had laughed about that; our money hadn't come. It was scarce anyway; we had little, but we had always had sufficient for our needs. This day we only had car fare to go to and come back from an area where we were teaching some people--we had transfers for the streetcar in our pockets. We were quite a way from our apartment.<br><br>I looked out of the corner of my eye and saw a man standing by a light pole. He seemed to start toward me hesitantly, and I quickly turned away. I just had an intuition he was going to ask me for help. My first thought was that I could not help him and I panicked a bit at that. I looked back and he had quickly retreated. He had caught that I had turned away. I felt sick as I saw his embarrassment. I went to him and said, "I sense that you would like to talk to me and I have to tell you that we are missionaries. I am sorry that there isn't anything we can do for you tonight."<br><br>He was immediately apologetic, backing away and saying, "I didn't know that. I wouldn't ask missionaries for anything. Please forgive me."<br><br>I said, "Tell me a little about yourself."<br><br>"I'm from Hamilton," he said, "a town fifty miles away. I lost my job recently. I came here this morning trying to find a job but didn't get here in time. I have no way to get home. I have not eaten, I haven't money to telephone my family, and I know my wife and children will be worrying and afraid."<br><br>I said, "We're not far from where we live. I have a transfer for the streetcar. Please use it and get on with my companion. I won't be much longer than you getting there, though I will likely be delayed a little."<br><br>He said, "Oh no, no."<br><br>I said, "Yes, yes, please. I have already had a heartbreak in turning away because I sensed your need and had no money to give you. We cannot leave you here."<br><br>It wasn't a big expostulation. It was a young man's guileless expression of what I had learned all my life in a widow's home. He finally agreed. He was discouraged and afraid. And so I ran, all the way. I ran fast and hard and got there a little ahead of them. We had good food in the apartment and I prepared some. The landlady was a gentle person who had a room where he could stay. We called Hamilton, Ohio, and he talked to his family.<br><br>I said, "Please tell them you will stay here tonight. Maybe tomorrow there is something we can do to help."<br><br>The next morning I called the branch president, a wonderful, gracious, Christ-like man who built and rebuilt and refurbished and brought homes up-to-date. I told him the story. He said, "He can have a job starting this morning." President Gilliam provided a place for him to stay and, soon, a place for his family, and he was on his way up. And I have nurtured in my heart for more than forty-five years a blessing I would have missed had I not helped this man.<br><br>I honestly believe this sense of concern was motivated both by the Spirit and by a home where helping an elderly little Scandinavian lady who lived a block away from our house was normal and expected. Sister Olsen needed help and had no helping family, so Mother regularly saw that she had food and that her little room was cleaned, and we tagged along. It was not particularly palatable for a little boy. I used to hold my nose and I'm ashamed of that. But we would go in and clean up.<br><br>I think often of my mother, to whom so many people came for help when she had heavy burdens of her own, including taking care of her little children by herself after our father died. She had the disposition to help others, and she seemed to find the time and resources necessary to meet the needs.<br><br>Look around you. Maybe, just maybe, limited as you are, and perhaps even in trouble yourself financially, there is someone to whom your outreach can mean much. There are so many who have needs that we may be able to help.<br><br>I desire to mention another special personal experience. I was teaching a class of many, many people in a chapel and adjoining cultural hall at the university. It was too large a class to permit much participation, but one night, facing maybe six or seven hundred people, I looked down and saw a face and said, "Bishop Garrett, do you have something you would like to share with us on the subject we are discussing?" This startled him for a moment, and then he said, "Yes, I think I do, Brother Hanks."<br><br>He came to the front and spoke: "A wonderful older couple lived in our ward. I was their bishop, and I also became almost like a son to them. They had no relatives and really no close friends. For reasons not necessary to mention, they moved to a little town far from this city. We kept in touch by phone because they had so few other contacts in this country.<br><br>"Then one night, as I walked to an early meeting of my bishopric, I had a clear vision. I am not a visionary man, but in my mind I saw something that night. I saw a long, narrow, oblong room with a casket at one end and a lady standing alone by it. I had read of the husband's death in the morning newspaper. I had said to my wife, 'We ought to go, but I can't. I have an important meeting that I cannot miss.'<br><br>"I rushed to the meeting that evening and told my counselors I had made a bad mistake and should be someplace else and asked them to go on without me. I drove too swiftly all the way to that small town with its small mortuary. I went inside the long, narrow room, and there inside was my vision specifically fulfilled: a single, solitary little soul standing by the casket of her beloved, her husband of many years. I went to her and held out my arms. She said, 'Oh, Bishop Garrett, I knew<i>you</i>would come.'"<br><br>Well, we ended the class with a testimony and an expression of gratitude. I knew what the Lord had wanted us to learn that night.<br><br>I pray that some of the same sweet spirit from these scriptures we have read tonight will cause you to understand that you have much to give.<br><br>I want to add that one time I had wisdom enough to pick up a pen and paper and write a letter to a coach in our state. He had dismissed almost his entire offensive and defensive starting team because they had conspired to break training rules. They thought he would not dare cut them off prior to their very big, publicized game, but they had clearly broken the rules under plain understanding of what was to happen. The few that remained did valiantly, but their team was slaughtered that weekend by a lower-ranked school.<br><br>I said in my note to the coach, "I have one son, and it probably won't happen, but if the good Lord were willing and that boy could play under your leadership, I would do anything I could to get him to you." I never met the man; I have not met him yet. I said, "I honor you. I commend you. I am grateful to live on an earth where there is somebody like you, because I love kids and you have just done something important."<br><br>He wrote back and said, "You would be interested, Mr. Hanks, to know what has happened to me since that day when I cut those boys off the team. I have had the ugliest threatening letters and warnings, been hanged in effigy, had a cross burned in my lawn, been told to get out of town or else, had parents who would like to beat me up. I have had all kinds of letters from the other side, and two--yours and the college president's--that commended me. Because of those two letters I have stayed."<br><br>This note didn't come until more than a year later when he had met the same opposing team with a team he now had that understood him and kept the rules. He was a great coach. They won the game, but that isn't really important. It isn't the publicity or the fame; it is the deed that counts. He had that kind of backbone. I had no such grand ideas when I penned that note. I was just honestly telling him how I felt as a human being.<br><br>You and I need to look around, reach out, assess our own capacities, and see those who are lonely, disaffected, and feeling unloved. Those people are no whit less valuable in God's eyes than the sweetest and handsomest and most talented of you. I am not suggesting that you run about foolishly, but I am suggesting that you open your eyes.<br><br>This principle is sacred in the eyes of God Almighty and his holy Son. We are not justified if we "pass by on the other side," hurrying to our priesthood meetings or to the temple or to do visiting teaching or anything else if there is something at hand we should do that the Lord wants done. I don't think we should or need to choose between serving God and serving our fellowmen. We cannot run faster than we have strength, and it is true also that there are seasons in our lives when we can do more than at other times. But all of us can do something, and most of us more than we are doing. I honestly think you won't be overwhelmed with competition if you begin quietly to look!<br><br><i>For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.</i><br><br><i>Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?</i>[Mormon 8:37, 39]<br><br>May God bless you. I testify that there is the sweetest joy in this world that I know of in the small and seemingly unimportant little things we do, not for the fame or glory or so we can talk about them, but because we see a need and we act.<br><br>There was a little girl who had had a hard time being born. I spoke with her for a minute about her name. I have a daughter with the same name; it is a beautiful name. Some time passed and her father said to me one day, "You didn't know, but Mary died not long after you were with us. She had been disturbed over her name. Kids made fun of her because it was so plain. Then you stopped for a minute or two and talked to her about it and that made a difference. Mary thereafter had some of the happiest weeks of her life."<br><br>Would that make you feel exalted with importance? What it made me do was weep and wonder how many times I might have done something to help someone and missed the opportunity and the blessing.<br><br><i>I have wept in the night</i><br><i>For the shortness of sight</i><br><i>That to somebody's need</i><br><i>Made me blind.</i><br><i>But I never have yet</i><br><i>Had a twinge of regret</i><br><i>For being a little</i><br><i>Too kind.</i><br><br>May God bless us, I pray, that we may have some sweet sense of relationship with him that comes about because what he did we are trying to do, too, in our own small patterns. God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marion D.

<h1>n: Unlocking Opportunity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I hope that you, brothers and sisters, recognize that it is not an easy assignment to give the keynote address. But it is wonderful for us to just take time out form the classes you've been attending and gather here together in this wonderful edifice and feel the excitement of what we're about and of this wonderful BYU Education Week.<br><br>As you are aware, this year's theme is "Education; Unlocking Opportunity," and I've been invited to develop that theme. I know each one of you would perhaps do it in a little different way, but the Spirit has directed me to talk about education in a broader sense--its application in our lives and our responsibility.<br><h2><b>Temples of Learning</b></h2><br>I want to reflect for just a moment on the history of this great institution. The impressive academy building on University Avenue was completed in 1892. Principal Karl G. Maeser knew the BYU Academy was just beginning to blossom. Prior to this, physical difficulties had brought him to the verge of leaving his post. Accordingly, his wife and daughter got things packed and sat on their trunks.<br><br><i>When the daughter finally mustered enough courage to ask her father when they were moving, his response was, "I have changed my mind. I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill</i>[which is the present site of this campus]<i>filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part in contributing to the fulfillment of that dream."</i>[<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years</i>, eds. Ernest L. Wilkinson and Leonard J. Arrington, vol. 3 (Provo: Brigham Young University Press 1976), p. 3]<br><br>President Holland has told us that the moral, spiritual, and intellectual guidance we seek can be found at BYU in large part because of the example set, the initial work performed, and the promise of the future first given us by Karl G. Maeser, a man of great personal integrity. In the foreword of Karl G. Maeser's biography, past BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson stated, "We go to the East for learning; but the East will come to the West for wisdom" (Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser, Mormon Educator</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1953), p. vii). And President Holland emphasizes that that is still our pledge.<br><br>In this learning process, perhaps we can all relate to the words of Robert Fulghum:<br><br><i>Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do, and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate-school mountain, but there is the sandbox.</i><br><br><i>These are the things I learned: Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Put things back where you found them. Clean up your own mess. Don't take things that aren't yours. Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody. Wash your hands before you eat. Live a balanced life. Learn some and think some, and draw and sing and dance and play and work every day some.</i><br><br><i>Take a nap in the afternoon. When you go out into the world, watch for traffic, hold hands and stick together. Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the plastic cup. The roots go down and the plant goes up, and nobody really knows why, but we are all like that.</i><br><br><i>Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup--they all die. So do we.</i><br><br><i>And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you learned, the biggest word of all:</i>look<i>. Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. The golden rule and love and basic sanitation. Ecology and politics and sane living.</i><br><br><i>Think of what a better world it would be if we all had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with our blankets for a nap. Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other nations always to put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own messes. And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out into the world, it is best to hold hands and stick together</i>. [Robert Fulghum, "We Learned It All in Kindergarten,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>October 1987, p. 115]<br><br>We are 25,000 strong, gathered together at this great university to sharpen our instruments, to hone our tools, to refresh those lessons we learned in the sandbox, that we might be better citizens in the kingdom of God. "to be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29).<br><h2><b>Thirst for Knowledge</b></h2><br>Eliza R. Snow asked and answered the question "What is the object of life?"<br><br><i>There certainly must be a grand and holy purpose at the foundation of our creation, else why this innate longing and thirst for knowledge--this perpetual desire for improvement and advancement. I have reflected upon this, and feel that our Heavenly Father has implanted these feelings and desires in our hearts, that this earthly probation may not be in vain. And the object of this life must be to test us, to try us in all things, and to make us more perfect, even as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</i>[<i>Women's Exponent</i>, vol. 7, no. 11, 1 November 1878, p. 81]<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 88:118 it states: "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." And further from that same section:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently . . . that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine . . . ;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are . . . ; things which are at home, . . . abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations . . . ; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–80]<br><br>President Holland shared some insight with us into the personal stories of two BYU graduates in August 1984 who had a great thirst for knowledge and achieved in spite of personal barriers. I would like to share their stories.<br><br>The oldest graduate that day was Lyle M. McDonald.<br><br><i>Lyle was born in Salina, Utah. At the appropriate time he entered BYU, his most enduring reminder of those years still being the permanent knee injury he received playing football. Lyle later left BYU--without a degree--to become a teacher and principal at the Page Elementary School on North Canyon Road here in Provo. It is fitting irony that BYU now owns that old Page School building, which is situated directly across the street from a slightly newer, and larger, football stadium. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now, after a full and fitting life, Brother McDonald returned to school . . . to finish that degree begun so long ago because "he wanted to improve himself, he wanted to help others, and he wanted more association with the 'great and qualified' professors at BYU." (Those are his words.) Furthermore, he wanted a university diploma to go along with his Master M-Man award and his World War I discharge papers. That's right. "The Great War. Old WW I," as Colonel Sherman Potter would say--"The war to end all wars." . . . Yes, our soldier returned to school for a diploma partly so his World War I discharge papers wouldn't be lonely. But an even loftier purpose ultimately prompted our veteran to return. He says simply and directly, "I wanted knowledge. We can't get into the celestial kingdom without knowledge. Knowledge is about the only thing we are allowed to take with us."</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, BYU commencement address, 17 August 1984, pp. 3–4]<br><br>The other student President Holland told about that day was Sauan Sukhan. He was not as old as Lyle McDonald; he was only thirty-five years old. But that same day he received<br><br><i>A Ph.D. degree in sociology. There is nothing very startling about that except he . . . has a personal story of valor and triumph in which private or public challenges have been overcome.</i><br><br><i>Sauan was born in a remote village in Thailand some 350 miles northeast of Bangkok. To say his parents, and indeed his entire village, were poor is to pathetically understate the case. Their home was a shelter of bamboo and grass. At three years of age Sauan was working full days tending water buffalo and cultivating rice paddies. To this very day there is still no such luxury in that village as running water or electricity. The closest hospital is a hundred miles away--four days by foot and ox cart, the only available means of transportation. It is something of a miracle that Sauan survived the myriad childhood diseases so common to that country. Eight of his fourteen brothers and sisters did not, and he watched his devout Buddhist parents bury them one by one.</i><br><br><i>At his village school there were no textbooks, no library, not paper or pencils. Two teachers helped 400 children practice their lessons on slate or dry clay. Only four years of even that rudimentary education were available in their small village. But like . . . you, Sauan wanted knowledge--as much as he could get. So from grades five through ten he walked fifteen miles to a school in the neighboring village. That was, he says, three hours each way in the dry season, but considerably more than that when it rained. Later, his parents spent virtually all of their savings (which, as you might guess, wasn't much for a family whose income bought Sauan a secondhand bicycle so that his quest for an education might not be so burdensome.</i><br><br>They gave him everything they had; when that was gone, they gave him encouragement.<br><br><i>But after the tenth grade there was no money for him to go to the city. So, like untold generations of his ancestors before him, he returned to the water buffalo and rice paddies that would forever mark the dimensions of his very narrow world. But even in the remote reaches of rural Thailand the Spirit of the Lord bears sway. Un a story too long to tell here, Sauan did, with the encouragement of these destitute but faithful Buddhist parents, get to the city briefly. And in the most providential of moments, he opened his door one day to two young Americans who had short hair, wore white shirts, and spoke impeccable Thai. The rest is history--sweet history.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, BYU commencement address, 17 August 1984, pp. 5–6]<br><br>Education, we see, is not merely gaining knowledge or skills helpful toward productive work, though certainly that is a part of it. Rather it is a replenishment and an expansion of the natural thirst of the mind and soul. Learning is a gradual process of growth, each step building upon the other. It is a process whereby the learner organizes and integrates not only facts but attitudes and values. The Lord has told us that we must open our minds and our hearts to learn. There is a Chinese proverb: "Wisdom is as the moon rises, perceptible not in progress but in result." As our knowledge is converted to wisdom, the door to opportunity is unlocked.<br><h2><b>Converting Knowledge into Wisdom</b></h2><br>Some years ago, in an article about Admiral Peary's effort to reach the North Pole, the writer suggested an analogy that has great significance to our time.<br><br><i>On this trip,</i>[Admiral Peary]<i>traveled a whole day toward the North, his sled dogs unflagging in their speed. At night, when he checked his bearings to determine his latitude, he found to his surprise that he was much further South than he had been in the morning.</i><br><br><i>All day, it seems he had been driving toward the North on an immense iceberg drawn southward by an ocean current.</i><br><br><i>And sometimes it occurs to me that we are all standing on this iceberg, racing forward in one direction, while the very ground beneath us moves implacably in the other direction.</i><br><br><i>With tremendous speed and power, we are moving toward discoveries and inventions that utterly dwarf Peary's conquest of the North Pole. In medicine, in technology, in food supply, in materials and techniques and processes, we have made more progress in the last fifty years than was made in the previous five hundred.</i><br><br><i>Yet, at the same time, the ground we are standing on steadily seems to move backward, drawn not by ocean currents, but by social currents too vast and deep for us to comprehend, much less to control.</i><br><br><i>As we check our bearings to determine the latitude of the human condition at this point in history, we are more surprised and appalled than Peary to learn that we are "farther South" than our fathers or grandfathers were.</i>[Sydney J. Harris, "Moving Forward in Backward Direction,"<i>Deseret News,</i>7 January 1964, p. A-14]<br><br>In talking about this story, Marion G. Romney stated:<br><br><i>Certainly mankind is more knowledgeable in many areas than it has ever been before. "In medicine, in technology, in food supply, in materials and techniques and processes," we have made and are making unprecedented progress. Not only is knowledge in these areas being accumulated so fast that one can hardly keep abreast of it, even in a very narrow field, but the application of much of it is literally transforming our way of life.</i><br><br><i>We are also gaining knowledge in other fields--those, for instance, which relate to men's personal conduct and to their dealings with one another. Unfortunately, however, we do not seem able to put the knowledge we acquire in these areas to similar beneficial use. An example of this is the continued use of tobacco in the face of knowledge that it greatly increases the incidence of lung cancer.</i><br><br><i>Another example is found in the area of family relations. In spite of all we know about the causes and evils of divorce, and in spite of the tremendous work done by marriage counselors and other welfare agencies, the divorce rate is still going up.</i><br><br><i>These are but two of many illustrations which could be cited to sustain the conclusion that "as we check our bearings to determine the latitude of the human condition at this point in history, we are more surprised and appalled than Peary to learn that we are 'farther South' than our fathers or grandfathers were."</i>[Marion G. Romney, "Converting Knowledge into Wisdom,"<i>Ensign</i>, July 1983, p. 4]<br><br>Never before have we had so many opportunities to be educated in the learning of the world. Our weakness seems to be our inability to apply with wisdom the knowledge we have in its practical relationship to life and its problems. The development of the capacity to convert knowledge into wisdom is a blessing that comes from the Holy Spirit as we gain profound reverence for the Lord and hearken to his counsels. As we seek learning by study and by faith, we are taught that we will receive the fullness of the Holy Ghost and be organized according to his laws and be prepared to obtain every needful thing.<br><h2><b>Service and Dedication</b></h2><br>Walsh McDermott, one of the most renowned physicians of the twentieth century, was an extraordinary human being. While widely acclaimed for the contributions he made to the rise of modern medicine, he is equally well remembers and endeared for the personal impact he made on the lives of many. He offered the gift of himself, which ultimately was profoundly sacred and spiritually enriching for those whose lives he touched. When McDermott died in 1981, it was said of him: "He was a people builder--a teacher-counselor of the young, the old, and the in-between. His understanding of the human condition and his affection for his fellow man was his most endearing and compelling quality." It was his caring and his sharing, his conduct in dealing with others that mattered most. (Taken from Claudia B. Cluff, "Spiritual Intervention Reconsidered,"<i>Topics in Geriatric Rehabilitation,</i>vol. 1, no. 2, January 1986, pp. 77–82.)<br><br>Built long after the original academy on University Avenue, BYU's continuing education building was appropriately named for a woman of profound reverence for the Lord as she continued to serve with great wisdom and long-suffering, gentleness and meekness, kindness and pure knowledge throughout her life. Caroline Hemenway Harman teaches much about moving northward in human relationships.<br><br>Elaine S. McKay tells the story of this remarkable woman, Aunt Carrie, in the<i>Ensign</i>.<br><br><i>Aunt Carrie would not have expected to be remembered by anyone but her family. She lived quietly in a small Utah community.</i>[In fact, the family home is still standing just down the road from our home.]<i>To anyone outside an area twelve miles square, she was and is a stranger. And yet, there is something familiar about her uncommon courage. She is like our mother, our grandmother, an aunt, a niece or sister. Aunt Carrie represents countless women, unknown and unsung, who patiently do the thing that needs to be done and who in reality accomplish the important work of the world. She reminds us that deeds need not be great to be heroic. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . On 26 January 1895 George</i>[Reese Harman]<i>and Caroline were married in the Salt Lake Temple.</i>[Caroline was twenty-two.]<i>During the next fourteen years they bought land, built a home, and became parents of seven children. Happiness grew out of industry, and they sorrowed only at the loss of their eldest child, George Luther, who died when he was four months old. . . .</i><br><br><i>During irrigation turns, George often worked at night. One evening, wet and chilled, he caught a cold which developed into pleurisy. He died 12 August 1912, and Caroline, at 39, was left with the responsibility of a farm and six children. Her oldest daughter, Annie, was fifteen; the baby, Maurice, had just turned three.</i><br><br><i>Four months later Caroline's sorrow deepened as she endured the death of her mother. But Caroline rallied to the responsibilities of life. Each day she arose at 5:00 a.m.--to tend to household duties and to work in the fields and orchards. During the weekly irrigation turns, she would make beds in the wagon, hitch up the horses, and drive with her young sons to the fields to set the water. Three or four times during the night, Caroline would awaken the boys and help them "change" the water. Only during haying season did they hire help. Caroline wanted her family to develop and use its own resources . . . .</i><br><br><i>During World War I, Caroline's Relief Society responsibilities multiplied. In 1914, the sisters began meeting one day a week to knit sweaters for soldiers, roll bandages, and prepare other Red Cross supplies to be shipped overseas. In 1917, Caroline became Relief Society president of the Granger Ward.</i><br><br><i>When the war ended, the deadly flu epidemic followed the soldiers home. Funerals were frequent. The Granger Relief Society made burial clothing, lined caskets, draped the chapel podium in white, cared for the sick, and comforted the bereaved.</i><br><br><i>David and Grace</i>[her sister and brother-in-law]<i>were both stricken. In January of 1919, Grace gave birth to a son; a few hours later, weakened by the flu, she died. Grieving for her beloved sister, Caroline brought to her own home a six-hour-old baby boy--her sister's child, but a child whom she would always look upon as her own.</i><br><br><i>Less than a month after Grace's death, . . . .in February, her daughter Annie died of the flu, a month before she expected her first child. . . .</i><br><br><i>When Annie, with her unborn child, died, Caroline's health broke. Weeks later, she arose from her bed, calm and determined. The doctor diagnosed her illness as sugar diabetes. From that time on, she gave herself three insulin shots daily and carefully weighed her food. It was a private matter; she never spoke of her health. In the years to come, she maintained energy, strength, a cheerful countenance, and an indomitable sense of humor.</i><br><br><i>Following Grace's death, David came to Caroline's home each day to see his baby son, Pete. . . . David's nine children needed a mother and he, a wife. On 29 October 1919, David and Caroline were married in the Salt Lake Temple. So, seven years after George's death, Caroline and her five children came to live in the big house on 3600 West and 4100 South.</i><br><br><i>For many years this house was a central gathering place for neighborhood children who liked teeter-totters, swings made of rubber tires, kick-the-can games, and run-sheepie-run. Like all visitors, the children seldom left without a "bit to eat." . . .</i><br><br><i>But at least twice a day the house was quiet. At breakfast and dinner time, all the leaves of the sixteen-foot-square table came out of the closet, the meal was spread, and it was time for family prayer. The huge Harman household tolerated teasing, wrestling, and noise. But quarrels were not permitted. Family members felt a unity that had begun long before David and Caroline married. Caroline honored David as patriarch, supported him as first counselor in the bishopric, and loved him deeply.</i><br><br><i>In the spring of 1924, an itching rash spread over David's body. Despite his discomfort, he worked long hours. While dipping sacks of potatoes (or wheat, depending on the account) in a solution to prevent the disease, he noted that the rash on his hands healed. After checking with a doctor, David decided to bathe in the solution. Accounts differ as to what and how much he used, but the result was the solution literally ate him alive. His skin came off on clothing and bed sheets; his tongue and teeth fell out; his internal organs were burned beyond use. After one week, during which David never lost consciousness, he passed away from this world.</i><br><br><i>David died with great courage and little complaint. Caroline lived in the same manner. At age 51, she was again a widow. She was now responsible for fourteen children, the youngest of whom was five-year-old Pete. She suffered complications from Diabetes. She was also Relief Society president of a ward with 948 members, 22 of whom were widows; and for Caroline, who served in the days before Welfare Services, this meant "mothering" the entire twelve-mile-square ward. Her way was not to ask for help, but to give it. Always someone was being born or someone was dying; someone was ill or unhappy or hungry. Caroline knew what to do about illness, childbirth, and death. And she knew how to find happiness. When others were wild with grief, she was there to make beds, mop floors, fix meals, and sit up through the night with the bereaved to comfort them with her quiet strength. She became known throughout the territory as Aunt Carrie--kind, cheerful, loving, wise.</i><br><br><i>How did she do it all with her large family? She did it with her large family. Year after year, the Harman sons drove her in a horse and buggy to visit every home in the ward--many times. Her black buggy would go to the houses of those who had "enough and to spare" to gather goods to be shared with those who had little or nothing. The Harman girls frequently cooked and served meals to neighbors in need, and the boys stayed overnight with the aged or afflicted when Aunt Carrie could not be there.</i><br><br><i>Aunt Carrie was a resourceful manager, and the children learned her ways. They had no money to spend, but the Harmans did not think of themselves as being "poor." They made bread, butter, cheese, horse radish, corned beef, apple cider, vinegar, and soap. Both sons and daughters farmed the land and cared for their animals, their orchard , and their garden. Every fall they bottled fruit, meat, and tomatoes and buried turnips, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes beneath the sawdust in the basement ice room. The girls sewed their few articles of clothing and kept their home scrubbed and orderly. If their chores were not done before the school bus came, they finished their tasks and walked to school. Aunt Carrie believed that idleness was a sin and taught that selfishness was the seed of misery. Everyone in the family learned to work--and more important, they learned to share.</i><br><br><i>Within</i>[a few weeks following a third marriage on 11 March 1925, her new husband]<i>Eugene suffered a stroke, and became an invalid. For five years until his death in October 1930, Aunt Carrie prepared his food, helped him bathe and dress, and ministered to his many needs.</i><br><br><i>In 1929 Aunt Carrie was released as president of the Relief Society. She has served in that organization under three bishops for some eighteen years. . . .</i><br><br><i>Aunt Carrie devoted much of her time to developing her chicken business. Her chickens had become a symbol of her doctrine of hard work and independence. During the worst of the Great Depression, the well which provided water for the house and chicken coops went dry. Aunt Carrie refused the help of the government programs under which she qualified for a new well; so Pete, Jack, and Jake carried water from across the road. Carrying water for the house was one thing, but quenching the thirst of hundreds of chickens was quite another. Finally, when Aunt Carrie had saved sufficient funds, she had the well repaired.</i><br><br><i>Years later, when all the children were gone, the pump sometimes failed. During winter time, Aunt Carrie would scoop snow into a big oval "boiler," melt it on the back of her coal stove, and carry warm water to her flock. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Aunt Carrie expected everything around her to be productive, and she would not have a lazy chicken. A hen who lacked commitment was invited for Sunday dinner . . . .</i><br><br>[As she neared the end of her life, Aunt Carrie said,]<i>"I can face Grace . . . because I know that I did all she would have done if I had been called away and she had stayed. I have no regrets. Of course," she added quietly, "in some ways all our children could do better. And they will. We taught them right." . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Aunt Carrie, . . . according to her son Leon Weston (Pete) Harman, "had every reason to be waited on. Yet she continually served others. She never complained. She never quit. Aunt Carrie asked for so little, and gave so much."</i>[Elaine S. McKay, "Remembering Aunt Carrie,"<i>Ensign</i>, October 1982, pp. 56–60]<br><br>What can we learn from Caroline Harman's life? She exemplified service and dedication to life's responsibilities. She had no college degrees but learned from experiences thrust upon her to respond to human needs. She truly knew the importance of family and the relationships between members of the family. She learned and taught principles of self-reliance, opening opportunities for herself and her family. She learned and taught principles of self-reliance, opening opportunities for herself and her family. And she learned wisdom and the application of knowledge. From Aunt Carrie, from Karl Maeser, from Lyle McDonald, from Dr.McDermott, and from Sauan Sukhan, and from the countless others we have learned from, it is important that one's life become a reflection of the possibilities of hope, of meaning, of purpose--a reflection of God. It is, after all, not so much what we know but what we are willing to share that makes the difference. This is the challenge for each of us here today.<br><br>We have come to seek knowledge, both spiritual and temporal, to help those around us respond to life's challenges. The usefulness of this learning comes in wise application as we become better able to fill our responsibilities to serve, that we might get a little closer to our destination, that north latitude.<br><br>Here we are in these beautiful temples of learning with qualified teachers, countless books, and resources. All of this and the Spirit, too. Yes, "Because [we] have been given much, [we] too must give" ("Because I Have Been Given Much,"<i>Hymns</i>, 1985, no. 219).<br><br>May we each receive the knowledge that is here. Use it in wisdom to unlock eternal opportunities. I know we are engaged in the work of the Lord, and it is my prayer that this knowledge we gain will be used in building the kingdom on earth today. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to be with you tonight, and I pray that the Holy Spirit may help us learn something about listening. I believe the Savior was speaking to you and me in the very first verse of the Doctrine and Covenants. It reads:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i><br><br>Let me tell you something about the opportunity you will have in the next few weeks to learn how to "listen together."<br><h2><b>"By the Mouths of My Disciples"</b></h2><br>Your stake presidencies and bishops are organizing their wards and stakes. I am not sure where you are in the process in your ward. I imagine the elders quorum president and the Relief Society president have been called. Perhaps some counselors have been called, and maybe some teachers. I hope some teachers have been called because next week there will be some classes that will need to be taught, and it will help if the people who will teach know about it now.<br><br>If I can read your hearts, this is a time of testing. Some of you are disappointed that you were not called. A few will be glad you were not called. Some of you maybe sad that you were overlooked again. And some of you are wondering about a person who was called whose weaknesses you know. Perhaps someone was called--someone you now must follow--whom you do not admire, or perhaps don't even like.<br><br>I bear you two testimonies that I pray the Spirit will confirm to you. First, God directs those who issue calls to even the apparently minor offices in the Church. And, equally important, God honors and respects those calls to his servants by using them to serve you.<br><br>Most of you believe that, and yet you still have a challenge. I have one, too. I have had experiences where even after I had a clear spiritual conviction that a person had been called to lead me or to teach me, it was still hard to really listen to them. You may think, "If only I were in a higher calling, then I wouldn't have to worry about getting my instructions from anyone else." But you know that is not true.<br><br>Every Sunday your bishop, for instance, makes a choice whether he will hold some meetings or some interviews or go to a Sunday School class. Teaching that Sunday School class will be someone whose weaknesses he knows and who likely will not have prayed and studied and struggled and served as much as the bishop has in the past week. But the bishop will go. And he, like you, will need to know how to listen.<br><br>A few may wonder about the requirement to listen to other people and ask, "Why do I have to get my directing and teaching from somebody else? Why can't I go to God for myself and get my own revelation? Why can't I have the Holy Ghost inspire me? Why does every call to lead, in fact, call others to listen? Why are we all, therefore, called to listen? Why should even a prophet have a home teacher?"<br><br>I don't know all the answers, but this much I do know: The revelations of God make it clear that his voice will sound to all people. We are told that in the fourth verse of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants. It says this: "And the voice of warning shall be unto all people." That voice, of course, is the voice of God. Verse 2 says, "For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men" (D&amp;amp;C 1:2). But in verse 4 when it says "the voice of warning shall be unto all people," it concludes with "by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days."<br><br>More than once the Lord simply says you will need to hear his voice, but you will need to hear his voice from him and from his servants. In verse 14 it says:<br><br><i>And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among people</i>.<br><br>I know a few of the reasons why the Lord requires us to listen to mortal servants. One of the reasons is that you and I need a check on our own inspiration occasionally. We can be mistaken. We at times, even with real intent and with faith and with careful prayer, may come to wrong conclusions. Listening to others can provide correction. It can promote more careful consideration. I hope you will always remember that there is safety in counsel.<br><br>I can think of another reason why we are blessed to be required to be taught by other human beings. For me, that is made clear in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 23, which says: "That the fullness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers."<br><br>Now why in the world would the weak and the simple be sent to kings and rulers? You and I sometimes feel that we are wise and we know a good deal. We have increasing experience. So why should a Sunday School teacher who seems to us weak and simple and less experienced be called by inspiration to teach us?<br><br>One reason is that it requires humility on our part. It requires a humble heart to believe that you can be taught by someone who apparently knows a good deal less than you do, and perhaps seems less likely to get revelation.<br><br>When I was the president of Ricks College years ago, I remember having a man who was my priesthood leader come to my house each month to interview me about my home teaching. He brought with him a gray notebook in which he wrote notes. He recorded not only my report as a home teacher, but my observations about the gospel and life as well.<br><br>I remember at first being very flattered. Then one Sunday he and I were visiting what was then called junior Sunday School. He was a few rows in front of me. The speaker was a little girl, no more than six or seven, probably not yet old enough to have the gift of the Holy Ghost. I glanced over at the man and noticed with surprise that he had that same gray notebook open. As the little girl spoke, he was writing with as much speed and intensity as he had in the study of my home. I learned a lesson from him that I haven't forgotten. He had faith that God could speak to him as clearly through a child as through the president of a college.<br><br>I watched that man in later months and years deal with great difficulties and with important assignments. I saw miracles--at least to me they seemed to be miracles--in his wisdom and in his ability to lead and to direct. Those miracles came, I believe in large part, because he could hear the voice of God confirmed by the Holy Spirit in words of the weak and the simple.<br><br>If you and I are going to live up to the glorious promises of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, I think we will have to learn how to have the everyday faith of my friend with the gray notebook. You remember verses 20 through 22 of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established.</i><br><br>You have often heard verse 38 quoted. It is the next to the last verse in the section. It is the way the Lord chooses to end his preface to his Doctrine and Covenants. He says:<br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i><br><br>Clearly, my problem and your problem is to hear the word of God from and through imperfect teachers and leaders. That is your test and mine. And it is our opportunity. All of us--today, next week, and for the rest of our lives--are going to be sitting somewhere while someone leads us or teaches us who will seem weak and simple because they are human, like us. God has said that if we are going to make it home again, we must not only hear his voice privately by our own effort, but also through the voice of his servants who, when the speak by the power of the Spirit, speak as if it were his voice.<br><br>Now the practical question is, how can we do it? Next week, for instance, you will go into a class where someone will teach you. They will look a little afraid and be imperfectly prepared, no matter how hard they have worked. You will have the challenge not simply to be attentive, but to listen the way my friend with the gray notebook did. He could hear the voice of God in the words of a child.<br><br>Our problem is to have the Spirit confirm to us the truth of the words of our leader or teacher just as it has, for instance, confirmed the words we have read in the Book of Mormon. Most of you, I would hope, have read in the Book of Mormon and have felt something in your heart or in your mind that told you it was true. I bear you my testimony that that is the voice of the Spirit speaking to you. Our pride is less likely to be aroused when we open the book than when a stranger or the fellow from the next apartment begins to speak. Nevertheless, whatever method works when we study alone should work as well when we listen together.<br><h2><b>The Guidance of the Spirit</b></h2><br>To me, the best directions of how to get the help of the Holy Ghost (directions that I have tested and know to be true) were given by President Marion G. Romney. If you will listen carefully, I will give you his instructions in his own words. Then together let us see if we can figure out how we can work to prepare for that Sunday School teacher or quorum leader or sacrament meeting speaker to whom we will listen next week.<br><br>Here are President Romney's instructions:<br><br><i>If you want to obtain and keep the guidance of the Spirit, you can do so by following this simple four-point program.</i><br><br><i>One, pray. Pray diligently. Pray with each other. Pray in public in the proper places....</i><br><br><i>Learn to talk to the Lord; call upon his name in great faith and confidence.</i><br><br><i>Second, study and learn the gospel.</i><br><br><i>Third, live righteously; repent of your sins by confessing them and forsaking them. Then conform to the teachings of the gospel.</i><br><br><i>Fourth, give service in the Church.</i><br><br>And then President Romney concludes this way:<br><br><i>If you will do these things, you will get the guidance of the Holy Spirit and you will go through this world successfully, regardless of what the people of the world say or do.</i>["Guidance of the Holy Spirit,"<i>Ensign</i>, January 1980, p. 5]<br><br>That four-point program makes no distinction between the moments we seek the Spirit when we are alone in our scripture reading and those moments when we are listening to a human being. I bear testimony that it works in both settings. It takes some extra effort sometimes when the words come from people instead of from the gilt-edged pages of scripture with which you have had long and sacred experience, but it can be done. Let us see how we might make that effort. In fact, we can decide together how we might start to do it tonight.<br><h2><b>Pray Diligently</b></h2><br>You remember President Romney began by saying: "Pray. Pray diligently. Pray with each other. Pray in public in the proper places. ... Learn to talk to the Lord; call upon his name in great faith and confidence."<br><br>You might (and I assure you I will) find a moment tonight to get in the proper place, perhaps alone, where you can pour out your heart. Among the things you will pray about, you might ask for a blessing on those who will teach you next Sunday--I promise you that I will. Try to visualize where you will be and who will teach you.<br><br>Next Sunday I am going to be sitting in a stake conference on one of the islands of the sea. Some of you know in a stake conference how it works. The visiting authority does a lot of listening. I will speak at the end of each meeting that I am in, but the rest of the time I will be listening. I will hear those people speak and their words will be translated for me. It is likely that the speakers will not have had as much education as I have had, nor have seen as many things as I have seen, nor have been taught as often as I have been taught by the prophets. But tonight I will pray for them. I don't know all their names. I haven't seen the full program yet, but I am sure they have been told who they are. They may be frightened, and they may be preparing right now. I will pray for them tonight with faith and with confidence. I will talk to God about them and tell him how much I desire for him to teach me through them. And I will promise tonight that, as I give my concluding talks, I will bear testimony of that which I have heard that I know is true. I will tell you now that I will be taught things that neither education nor the previous teaching I have received has ever provided me. From those humble, simple people I will be taught things that I will be able to bear testimony of.<br><br>You may not know who your Sunday School teacher or quorum teacher of Relief Society teacher will be next week, but you can do the same thing. You can pray specifically that the Holy Ghost will come to them as they prepare to teach, and then come again as you sit at their feet to listen next week.<br><br>I am not sure I understand how this works, but I know it works. Last Monday night I was preparing to come here. I felt some impressions of something I was supposed to teach you. They came with more than the normal intellectual force. In fact, I felt that power I have come to know as the teaching of the Holy Spirit. But something else came. As I received the idea for this talk, I felt it an impression that I was receiving it because of the prayers of one or more of you. Now I am not so egotistical to think that many of you even knew I was coming. I wouldn't think I was on very many people's minds, but I must have been on someone's mind. Perhaps it wasn't so much that you were naming me, but you must have been pleading to be given some help, to be taught something, to be given some assurance, and I must have been the most available servant, or at least the one who was going to come here next.<br><br>Now you blessed me, but I want you to know there are limits to that, of course. The companionship of the Holy Ghost is one that you earn. Your teacher cannot depend upon you alone. You cannot with your faith force the attendance of the Holy Ghost on him or her. As you know, when we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is not told to come to us. We are told to receive the Holy Ghost. That is done by faith and repentance, by making covenants and accepting ordinances, and then working hard to get and keep the gift. Your teacher cannot be compelled by you to receive it, but by your prayers you can and will bring down the blessings of heaven, and particularly the gift of the Holy Ghost, which will help your teachers and your leaders.<br><h2><b>Study and Learn</b></h2><br>As you will recall, President Romney's second suggestion for obtaining and keeping the guidance of the Spirit was to study and learn the gospel. That won't be hard for you to apply tonight in getting ready for next week either. There will be a lesson in that class next Sunday. With a little effort you could probably get a manual, or with a phone call find out what the subject will be. Then you could go to the topical guide, or from your own knowledge of the scriptures you could begin to learn something now about what you will listen to then.<br><br>Most of you have been teachers at one time or another in the Church, and so you know how rare it is for a student in your class to have done that. You knew who they were. It was not so much what they said, although it may have been in what they asked in class. It may have been simply the look in their eyes. It may have been their attentiveness. But you knew that some people prior to coming to your class had studied and by doing so had let heaven know that they wanted to be taught. That changed the class, and it chanted your teaching.<br><h2><b>Live Righteously</b></h2><br>President Romney's third injunction was to "live righteously; repent of your sins by confessing them and forsaking them. Then conform to the teachings of the gospel." I hope a day doesn't begin or end that you don't consider whether something you did might have offended the Holy Ghost or made it harder for the Spirit to influence you. That is what it means to me to have a repentant heart.<br><br>You might, in addition, be eager to conform to the quiet promptings that urge you to take action. Make a commitment tonight that the next time you are taught by one of the servants of God you will heed any prompting, even the faintest prompting, to act, to do better. In fact, you could commit to opening your heart now to those promptings. That also is the spirit of repentance.<br><br>I have had that happen to me recently. I was sitting in my home ward in the presence of a teacher who said something, and I felt a very faint prompting from the Spirit to act that day. I bear you my testimony that the scriptures are not being poetic when they describe the Holy Ghost as the still, small voice. It is so quiet that if you are noisy inside, you won't hear it. It is real. I felt also that if I didn't do it promptly, I would not again, at least not soon, feel that gentle instruction. So I did it. It is already changing my life and the lives of my children, some of whom are here tonight. I am confident that because I went and did the small thing that I felt impressed by the quiet voice to do, I made it more likely that I could receive a spiritual nudge again.<br><br>I pray that you will make a commitment to act on those promptings you receive when listening to your teachers and leaders. If you have felt a prompting to do something that you heard tonight, and if you do it, you will reinforce a pattern in your life of repentance--which is to be eager to be instructed, even to be reproved, and then to act.<br><br>What the scripture calls a "humble and contrite heart" has always been exemplified for me in two paragraphs from the autobiography of Parley P. Pratt. Perhaps it touched me because I admired so much the strength of Elder Pratt and also because I like so little to be rebuked. Here is the first paragraph of the two--I will have to break between the two because you need a little background.<br><br><i>After journeying for several hundred miles up the Platte, we at length met two messengers from the pioneers under President Young, from Salt Lake Valley. These were P. Rockwell and E. T. Benson; who had been sent out to try to find us and report our progress and circumstances. Having visited all the camps, they returned to the valley, or rather to where they met the President and pioneers, on their way back to Winter Quarters on the Missouri. I accompanied them back nearly one days' ride on the way, and then bid them God speed, and returned to my own camp. Soon after this our fifty met the President and company of pioneers and camped with them one day.</i><br><br>Now this is where you need a little background. For a moment, think of yourselves as Parley P. Pratt. He was leading a hard, hard march. He was doing the best he knew how. He was an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was meeting his leader, one with whom he had been in great difficulties. Elder Pratt saw himself as an experienced man, as indeed President Young was experienced.<br><br>Can you young men now picture yourselves having a priesthood interview with your elders quorum president? He is going to talk to you about what you have been doing. You have been working hard. Aren't you prepared for a little praise? Wouldn't you like him to tell you how wonderful you were?<br><br>Parley P. Pratt had arrived in Winter Quarters after President Young and the Quorum of the Twelve had made some very specific arrangements. Elder Pratt had taken a look at the plans and thought he could do better. He changed the arrangements. He did not know that--at least according to one of the other members of the Twelve who had been there--they were a decision of the Council and were revelation. Listen to Parley P. Pratt's description of that day with his priesthood leader.<br><br><i>A council was called, in which I was highly censured and chastened by President Young and others. This arose in part from some defect in the organization entered into under the superintendence of the President before he left the camps at Winter Quarters; and of variously interfering with previous arrangements. In short, I was severely reproved and chastened. I no doubt deserved this chastisement; and I humbled myself, acknowledged my faults and errors, and asked forgiveness. I was frankly forgiven, and, bidding each other farewell, each company passed on their way. This school of experience made me more humble and careful in future, and I think it was the means of making me a wiser and better man ever after.</i>[<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), pp. 330–31]<br><h2><b>Serve in the Church</b></h2><br>Fourth, President Romney said to give service in the Church. That works in powerful ways when you are seeking the Holy Spirit and its direction privately. In my life, I have felt the most guidance when I was in God's service, doing something for one of his children.<br><br>It can work in the next class or executive meeting you attend in the Church when some very mortal person is in front of you. Rather than thinking, "Well, let's see whether this teacher or leader can convince me" or "How good are they going to be today?" you could think another way. You could say to yourself, "What is it they are trying to accomplish?" Then you could ask yourself quietly, "What can I do to help?"<br><br>You will change your whole experience in that hour by making their service your service. That choice of an attitude will change the way you listen. Thoughts will come to you during a class or in a meeting that would not come otherwise.<br><h2><b>The Giving of a Gift</b></h2><br>We have talked mostly about what can come to you as you listen if you apply President Romney's guide, but there is something even more. Seeking the Spirit can bring your blessings. Seeking to bring it down on someone else brings it to you, but it also adds the joy of gift-giving.<br><br>What we have been talking about is giving a gift to your teacher or your leader. It is done by the way you pray, by the way you study, by the way you have a contrite heart, and by the way you add your service to theirs. You make it more likely that they will feel the power of the Holy Ghost in their service.<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie described the magnitude of that gift. Listen carefully to what he said:<br><br><i>The Holy Ghost is a Revelator; he is a Sanctifier; he reveals truth, and he cleanses human souls. He is the Spirit of Truth, and his baptism is one of fire; he burns dross and evil out of repentant souls as though by fire. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the greatest of all the gifts of God, as pertaining to this life; and those who enjoy that gift here and now, will inherit eternal life hereafter, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God in eternity.</i>[<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979–81), 2:122]<br><br>Now, I have tried to give you some reasons why our Heavenly Father had the Savior organize his Church so that we have to be led and taught by his weak and simple servants. And we have talked about how to make it more likely that we can hear the words of God in their words. If we will try to apply President Romney's advice, not just for our own revelation, but to bring the Holy Ghost as a revelator to those who lead and teach us, we will add the blessing to our lives of participating in the giving of a gift.<br><br>President David O. McKay describes what it means when the Holy Ghost comes into a life. He said it this way: "What the sunshine is to the field and to the flowers the Holy Spirit is to the life of man" (CR, October 1930, p.10). It has been my experience that that sunshine comes into my life even more powerfully when my effort is to try to help those who lead or teach me.<br><br>Some of you are perhaps already thinking about general conference. You may be praying that the Brethren who speak and who lead us will have the Holy Spirit. I will make a twofold promise to you. First, your prayers will be answered if they are offered with faith and with confidence. Second, not only will you bring sunshine to the lives of others, but you will bring sunshine into your own life. As the Brethren speak, you will be able to listen and hear the words of God as he instructs you through his servants. You will recognize the words of truth that you need. And that is sunshine.<br><br>George Q. Cannon gives one of the marvelous descriptions of how you will recognize the influence of the Holy Ghost. He said this:<br><br><i>I will tell you a rule by which you may know the Spirit of god from the spirit of evil. The Spirit of God always produces joy and satisfaction of mind. When you have that Spirit you are happy; when you have another spirit you are not happy. The spirit of doubt is the spirit of the evil one; it produces uneasiness and other feelings that interfere with happiness and peace.</i>[<i>JD</i>15:375]<br><br>I do not know how you are feeling tonight, but I hope you feel happiness. I do. That is an indication that we are on the right course. I can promise you that you can not only feel that now, but you can look forward to it over a lifetime, even a lifetime that may have its trials and its great difficulties.<br><h2><b>"When the Speaker Begins, I Listen"</b></h2><br>Years ago I was sitting in a sacrament meeting with my father, whose name is the same as my own, Henry Eyring. He seemed to be enjoying what I thought was a terrible talk. I watched my father, and to my amazement, his face was beaming as the speaker droned on. I kept stealing looks back at him, and sure enough, through the whole thing he had this beatific smile.<br><br>Our home was near enough to the ward that we walked home. I remember walking with my father on the shoulder of the road that wasn't paved. I kicked a stone ahead of me as I plotted what I would do next. I finally got up enough courage to ask him what he thought of the meeting. He said it was wonderful.<br><br>Now I really had a problem. My father had a wonderful sense of humor, but you didn't want to push it too far. I was puzzled. I was trying to summon up enough courage to ask him how I could have such a different opinion of that meeting and that speaker.<br><br>Like all good fathers, he must have read my mind because he started to laugh. He said: "Hal, let me tell you something. Since I was a very young man, I have taught myself to do something in a church meeting. When the speaker begins, I listen carefully and ask myself what it is he is trying to say. Then once I think I know what he is trying to accomplish, I give myself a sermon on that subject." He let that sink in for a moment as we walked along. Then, with that special self-deprecating chuckle of his, he said, "Hal, since then I have never been to a bad meeting."<br><br>I don't suppose he used all of the steps I have described to you. He may very well have prayed for that speaker. Over a lifetime he had studied. When he knew what the speaker was trying to say, he had a deep well to go to so he could give himself that sermon.<br><br>My father was the kind of man who would have listened to that high council visitor. If he had felt a little pricking in his heart to do something, Dad would have done it. He could listen to anybody. He used to embarrass me when we stopped to get gas because he would seek advice from the gas station attendant. Dad would always treat him as an equal. Dad would say: "Look, I can learn something from anybody. They have had experiences I haven't had."<br><br>I think you can have faith and confidence that you will never need to hear an unprofitable sermon or live in a ward where you are not fed spiritually. Wherever you are can always be a place in the kingdom where the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants is not poetry but pure description. These words will be true for you when you are taught in your home or in your apartment or in a class or in a council meeting. These words for you will simply be the truth.<br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</i><br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i><br><br><i>That the fullness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. [D&amp;amp;C 1:20–23]</i><br><br><i>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:38]<br><br>I pray with my whole heart that we may listen together and that we may have the gift of the Holy Ghost, both in our private search for truth and as we sit at the feet of the servants of God wherever we may be.<br><br>I am blessed in my calling to sit at the feet of prophets. I have spent hours in their presence. I bear you my testimony that Ezra Taft Benson is God's prophet upon the earth. I sit with him and hear him speak on a wide variety of issues. He is careful. He speaks with deliberation. I have had the Spirit confirm to me that the words he spoke were what the Lord would have him speak.<br><br>Today I sat in a Sunday School class and heard a man who had worked hard to prepare. I heard him speak words that the Holy Spirit also bore witness to me were true.<br><br>I know God lives. He is your Father and he loves you. There are some in this room who need to know that to him you are very important and perfectly known. I bear you my testimony that his son, Jesus Christ, came into the world and atoned for our sins. I testify that the Atonement works. If you will have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and repent and submit to the ordinances at the hand of those who have authority and then receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, in time and by your effort sins will be washed away and you can have confidence that you can go again into the presence of your Heavenly Father.<br><br>The Holy Ghost is real. There is a still small voice of truth that can speak to you. I pray with my whole heart that you have felt it in some way this day, perhaps not while we have been together, but when someone spoke to you in a meeting earlier today. I pray that it will happen again this evening. If someone who is trying to serve you calls you on the phone or speaks to you in some way, I hope you will see their human kindness and their interest. But beyond that, I hope you will understand that God's servants are going out across the earth called and empowered by him. They can bring blessings and guidance and help to you.<br><br>I pray that will come to you this day and always, and I pray that you will do all you can to help it come. I bear you this testimony and pray these blessings for you and for myself in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>on: America at Their Most Enlightened and Alert - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome back to school. As Sister Holland has said, we love you and miss you when you are away, and we are praying for you to have a bright and beautiful year together. Work hard. Learn much. Make your opportunities count. And<i>do</i>come in on time at night, but<i>don't</i>come by our house to tell us.<br><h2><b>Another Election Year</b></h2><br>This first semester of our brand-new academic year, it should be duly noted, is going to be spiced up by a national presidential election. It is now the first week of September, the conventions are over, and we have nine weeks to the day to go. And we know only two things for certain: first, that as Reinhold Niebuhr once said, "Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary" (<i>The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness,</i>1944). Democracy is indeed, in that sense, still "on trial." The civic loyalty and involvement of our people is its fundamental appeal and its only protection. Take your responsibilities seriously, document and discuss the issues, and cast your vote if you are of age. (And almost all of you are.) Democracy only works if you do. That's the first thing we need to know in an election year. The second thing we know is that the humorists are going to have a heyday, and indeed already are.<br><br>Americans love to joke about their public figures. Thomas E. Dewey is said to have been the first presidential casualty of a political joke when, in the campaigning of 1948, some comedian said he looked like he had just fallen off a wedding cake. Now you are all too young to have even seen pictures of Governor Dewey, but with his impeccable dark suits and pencil-thin mustache, that is exactly how he looked--and people laughed. President John F. Kennedy may not have laughed, however, when Bob Hope kept snickering about his youth. Mr. Hope said they had served milk at Kennedy's first cabinet meeting, but it hadn't turned out well because they spent the next half hour just burping each other.<br><br>Comedians are especially tough on politicians who move from unknown to nationally famous in just an instant, like Senator Dan Quayle, for example. Now, regardless of your personal political persuasion, you have to admit that Senator Quayle has been the object of plenty of "fowl" jokes. Mark Russell said he didn't know whether the ticket of "Bush and Quayle" was the title of a hunting magazine or the name of an English pub. Nevertheless, Republicans are insisting that this ticket is the nation's best possible insurance against turning back the clock to those bitter days of the sixties when this country was torn apart over the war in Indiana. It was absolutely terrible, says Russell--the bombing of Indianapolis, the mining of harbors along the Ohio River, crawling through those jungles just outside Gary and South Bend. But Jay Leno has defended Senator Quayle's military service devoutly. He said National Guardsmen are necessary, even though all they can do is "sit around waiting for something to happen. If that isn't training for the vice presidency, I don't know what is."<br><br>Military service aside, many feel that Senator Quayle has distinct advantages over his Democratic counterpart, Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Someone said that at least two things Quayle has that Bentsen doesn't have are a hair blower and a discernible pulse. Governor Dukakis' advisers wanted him to pick a running mate who was less exciting than himself, one not likely to overshadow him. Inside sources say it came down to either Senator Bentsen or Orville Redenbacher.<br><br>As for the presidential candidates themselves, the comedians are not a whit more reverential. To them Bush is a wimp and Dukakis a shrimp, with neither of them threatening Webster's or Calhoun's reputations for oratory. Mark Russell said he didn't think there was enough caffeine in the whole world to keep us awake through these nine weeks. (I don't know where that leaves us at BYU.)<br><br>Johnny Carson may have rendered the unkindest cut of all when he said that Governor Dukakis was so confident he had already ordered Phone Book One to sit on in the Oval Office. Carson quickly noted, however, that Dukakis had reason to be confident because one of Vice-President Bush's recent stem-winding addresses, a police officer and the district attorney came up, drew a chalk outline around him, and said no one could approach the podium until they had identified the next of kin.<br><h2><b>"He Built for Eternity"</b></h2><br>Well, enough of this nonsense. There really is method in my madness this morning. In addition to the very important matter of a presidential election year--and it is a very important matter, all joking aside--BYU is also saluting in something of a final way the bicentennial anniversary of the U.S. Constitution, the document William Gladstone once described as "the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man" ("Kin Beyond Sea,"<i>North American Review</i>127 [September/October 1878], p. 185). In fact, BYU is this very moment in the midst of producing a feature-length film on the Constitutional Convention that will premiere on 30 April 1989, the bicentennial anniversary of George Washington's inauguration as the first and, arguably, the greatest of this republic's forty presidents.<br><br>Surely when the Lord speaks in section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants of raising up "wise men" for the founding of this nation and the establishment of constitutional government, he must have been speaking first and foremost of George Washington. As unassuming as he was, Washington's impact on the new republic and on the framing of its government was greater than that of any other living man. His prestige as the victorious colonial general was immense, and his character, his very presence, inspired confidence.<br><br>Note this language used by a journalist of the day to describe Washington's arrival for that first inauguration. It is unclear whether the writer is describing royalty or deity.<br><br><i>It is impossible to do justice ... to ... the Scene exhibited on his Excellency's approach to the city. Innumerable multitudes thronged the shores, the wharves, and the shipping--waiting with ... anticipation his arrival....</i><br><br><i>This great occasion arrested the publick attention beyond all powers of description. ... All ranks and professions expressed thief feelings, in loud acclamations, and with rapture hailed the arrival of the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY...</i><br><br><i>The scene ... was ... beyond any descriptive powers of the pen to do justice to--How universal ... the sentiments of respect and veneration!--All ranks</i>[exclaimed,]<i>"WELL, HE DESERVES IT ALL!"</i><br><br><i>The spontaneous</i>[expressions]<i>of gratitude ... are the highest reward that virtue enjoys, ...</i><br><br><i>Many persons ... were heard to say, that they should now die contented--nothing being wanted to complete their happiness ... but the sight of the Saviour</i>of [their new nation]. [From the<i>Connecticut Courant</i>of 4 May 1789, in Everett Carll Ladd,<i>The American Polity</i>(New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1987), pp. 72–73]<br><br>That was written two hundred years ago. Two hundred years later the adulation is still nearly the same in both tone and content. Listen to this from a resolution passed by Congress and read by the president of the United States on the two-hundredth anniversary of Washington's birth:<br><br><i>Washington has come to personify the American Republic. He presided over the convention that framed our Constitution. The weight of his great name was the deciding factor in securing its adoption by the States. These results could never have been secured had it not been recognized that he would be the first President. When we realize what it meant to take13 distracted colonies, impoverished, envious, and hostile, and weld them into an orderly federation under the authority of a central government, we can form some estimate of the influence of this great man....</i><br><br><i>We have seen many soldiers who have left behind them little but the memory of their conflicts; but ... the power to establish among a great people a form of self-government which the test of experience has shown will endure was bestowed upon Washington, and Washington alone. ... His was the directing spirit without which there would have been no independence, no Union, no Constitution, and no Republic. His ways were the ways of truth. He built for eternity. His influence grows. His stature increases with the increasing years. In wisdom of action, in purity of character, he stands alone. We can not yet estimate him. We can only indicate our reverence for him and thank the Divine Providence which sent him to serve and inspire his fellow men.</i>[<i>Handbook of the George Washington Appreciation Course for Teachers and Students</i>(Washington, D.C.: U.S. George Washington Bicentennial Commission, 1932), pp. vii–viii]<br><br>To co-opt a line from James Madison regarding those crucial times, George Washington "decide[d] forever the fate of Republican government" (Ladd,<i>The American Polity,</i>p.73).<br><br>I have gone to some length this morning to pay tribute to Washington for at least two reasons. The first is because he is a genuine hero, and I have always wanted to make some public expression about the truly remarkable man I believe he was. I think we may never fully appreciate the magnitude of his impact upon those neonatal days of this nation when it could have so easily died aborning.<br><br>The second reason is to draw all of this closer to home, to see what lessons Washington and his age have for us here at the start of another school year at BYU. To make that transition I quote a recent BYU visitor, political pundit and journalistic gadfly Garry Willis. Said he:<br><br>[In an election year]<i>we get the presidents we deserve. A great people is what you need for a great president.</i>Washington was the greatest president, because the people were at their most enlightened and alert. [America] right now is escapist<i>. It wants to be soothed, and told it doesn't have to pay or sacrifice or learn</i>. ["Things That Matter,"<i>Vis a Vis,</i>July 1988, p. 70; emphasis added]<br><br>Now our jokes about candidates and campaigns leave a bit of a taste in our mouths. Can that possibly be true, that the<i>people</i>made Washington great? That<i>they</i>, as well as he, were "at their most enlightened and alert"? What does that mean for a university, especially for Brigham Young University? I know it means there must be no concession to escapism here, that we must not be "soothed" regarding sacrifice and learning. This university was born out of pioneer effort and anguish. We have a century-long tradition here of asking very much of those who come, and we are asking more and more every year. We intend to be a great people here. We intend to be one of the great universities of the world, a unique university whose light casts a very special gospel glow. But to do that, to become that, will require the commitment and loyalty of<i>every one of us</i>. As Ben Franklin said at the fateful signing of the declaration that started it all, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately" (to John Hankcock, on signing the Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776). This is still true, two hundred and twelve years and two months and two days later in Provo, Utah.<br><h2><b>Knowledge Wedded to Virtue</b></h2><br>Study diligently this year. You owe it to both your prophetic and political ancestors. The inestimable Thomas Jefferson said, "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... , it expects what never was and never will be" (letter to Colonel Charles Yancey, 6 January 1816). That sounds very much like something revealed through our own Joseph Smith--that men and women cannot be saved in ignorance, and indeed, that they can be saved no faster than they gain knowledge (D&amp;amp;C 131:6;<i>Teachings</i>, p. 217).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith, who shortly before his untimely death had determined to run for the office of president of the United States, said to all of us at BYU;<br><br><i>Thy mind, O man! If thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity....</i><br><br><i>... Your minds will expand wider and wider, until you can circumscribe the earth and the heavens, ... and contemplate the mighty acts of Jehovah in all their variety and glory.</i>[<i>Teachings</i>, pp. 137, 163]<br><br>This university is one of the "mighty acts of Jehovah," so far as I am concerned, and we need to pledge to it our devout and loyal citizenship. "Just say no" to some pleasures and some distractions. Be a little more serious about the responsibilities you have here. Stretch your minds, study, and pray. Learn what great people must always learn. Seek wisdom out of the best books. Seek it "by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Have appropriate fun at a great time in your life, but do not wish to be soothed in the rigor of a superior education. If we are to be all God wants us to be, we must be "at our most enlightened and alert."<br><br>Brigham Young, who did not run for president of the United States but for a brief moment did run<i>from</i>one, said,<br><br><i>All the knowledge, wisdom, power, and glory that have been bestowed upon the nations of the earth, from the days of Adam till now, must be gathered home to Zion.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:279]<br><br><i>Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:146]<br><br><i>Learn everything that the children of men know.</i>[<i>JD</i>16:77]<br><br><i>Take pains and pride to ... rear</i>[y]<i>our children so that the learning and education of the world may be theirs.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:326]<br><br>Whether building countries or wilderness cabins, whether crossing the Delaware or the American desert, the Founding Fathers of this nation and the prophets of the Restoration knew that<i>ignorance was the enemy</i>, literally and profoundly a tool of the adversary. "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37). "If men would be great in goodness, they must be intelligent" (Brigham Young, Manuscript History of the Church, manuscript in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Archives, Salt Lake City, 22 September 1851, vol. 21, p. 88). "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be."<br><br>Of course, from the earliest beginnings of Western civilization, it has always been understood that knowledge had to be wedded to virtue, that mere information untempered by qualities of justice and mercy and duty and compassion could leave one simply a sophisticated barbarian in the end.<br><h2><b>"Live Appropriately"</b></h2><br>Perhaps the greatest essayist ever to put pen to paper wrote, "To<i>compose our character</i>is our duty, not to compose books, and to win, not battles and provinces, but<i>order</i>and<i>tranquility</i>in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live appropriately" (Donald M. Frame, trans.,<i>The Complete Essays of Montaigne</i>[Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1958], pp. 850–51; emphasis added).<br><br>That is true whether one speaks of founding a republic or pursuing a university degree. So is this from the brilliant Edmund Burke:<br><br><i>Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains on their own appetites. ... Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that</i>men of intemperate minds cannot be free<i>. Their passions forge their fetters</i>. [<i>The Works of the Right Honorable Edmund Burke,</i>vol. 4 (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1889), pp. 51-52; emphasis added]<br><br>That was said, for all intents and purposes, at the very hour this nation was being born, but it sounds like something someone would say today at BYU. Who would speak that way? Joseph Smith? Or Brigham Young? Or Karl G. Maeser? Or Ezra Taft Benson? Or your freshman English teacher?<i>All</i>of them would say it. Ignorant, intemperate minds and behavior are the enemies to all true possibility--social, intellectual, and theological. On the other hand, educated, disciplined, virtuous lives are the mark and hope of true godliness, true strength, and freedom--in this life and forever.<br><br>We want you to feel a genuine sense of freedom at BYU, but that can only come with an appreciation for the moral expectations and academic standards we have cultivated here for more than one hundred years. You are absolutely free-perfectly free-Founding Father and George Washington free to embrace the vision of this university established by apostles and prophets, and agreed upon by this community in common consent. We plead with you to seize fully and luxuriate in that opportunity. At BYU you are free to become more than you can become at any other university in the world--but then you know, of course, that I am very biased. "To compose our character is our duty ... and to win, not battles and provinces, but order and tranquility in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live appropriately."<br><br>Such public and personal virtue was understood by the Founding Fathers to be the<i>precondition</i>for republican government, the base upon which the structure of all government would be built. Such personal ideals as John Adams' "virtuous citizen" and Thomas Jefferson's "moral sense" and "aristocracy of talent and virtue" were fundamental. Even the pessimistic James Madison said,<br><br><i>I go on this great republican principle, that the people will have virtue and intelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom. Is there no virtue among us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks, no form of government, can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.</i>[20 June 1788, in<i>The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution,</i>arr. Jonathan Elliot, vol. 3 (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1901), pp. 536–37]<br><h2><b>To Be Honorable</b></h2><br>We have a code of honor at BYU, and I invite you to join with us this year in discussing and enhancing it. I especially invite you to join with your BYUSA officers in reviewing this code, examining its tradition and meaning, and reexamining its premises and its promises. If as a university community it is possible, as some already helping us consider, to write a yet better expression of what it means to be honorable here, we will do so.<br><br>Inasmuch as this is your code, and it is the broad basis upon which we form a moral community at BYU, it is important for you to understand it and come to feel a sense of personal ownership for it. It means much more than keeping your hair trimmed and well groomed, and more than dressing modestly and cleanly, though we expect that of every one of you. Surely all can understand why shorts and miniskirts and sloppy clothing and bizarre hair fashions are inappropriate at BYU. We want a clean, modest, dignified appearance because we stand for something here. We are<i>not</i>a high school and we are not just<i>any</i>university. At BYU, disciplined appearance represents an external aspect of a much more important and sacred inner discipline. Perhaps good grooming and modest, clean clothing are for BYU what some religions speak of as symbolic sacraments--"an outward sign of an inward grace." And that "inward grace" ought to be dealing with what Jesus called "the weightier matters of the law." These include honesty and chastity and integrity and service--the consequential issues of the Honor Code.<br><br>Be honest in class and out. Be women and men of integrity with your teachers, your roommates, your bishops, and yourselves. Don't cheat on an exam or steal a bicycle or backpack and then stand in slack-jawed wonder when a high-ranking government official commits espionage or a wealthy businessman goes to jail for embezzlement.<br><br><i>How true is that our destinies are decided by nothings and that a small imprudence helped by some insignificant accident, as an acorn is fertilized by a drop of rain, may raise the trees on which perhaps we and others shall be crucified.</i>[Henri Frederic Amiel,<i>Journal</i>, 9 April 1856, tr. Mrs. Humphry Ward]<br><br>Be clean in thought and word and deed. I told you last winter how strongly I feel about the symbols and sacraments of human intimacy. That intimacy is not yours to violate, and you do so at your peril. It will never matter at BYU if we have immaculate buildings and manicured grounds and clean clothing and well-groomed hair if in our inner selves we are, as Christ once said to the hypocritical, "like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and ... uncleanness" (Matthew 23:27).<br><h2><b>Steven Blake's Sacrifice</b></h2><br>I started with George Bush and Michael Dukakis and went on to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. That is all pretty heady company for us here in Utah County. Let me end on a more local note, with one brand of BYU citizenship much closer at hand. I tell you this story for its virtue, not for sensationalism or sentimentality.<br><br>Last Tuesday, just one week ago this very hour, Steven Eugene Blake was buried, a twenty-one-year-old sophomore, son of faculty member and friends Reed and Katie Dean Blake. Steven was a BYU student majoring in just about everything, one who believed in learning and virtue and sacrifice. He interrupted his university experience to serve a mission, as so many of you will do or have done, and he served with devotion and faith and immense enthusiasm.<br><br>Two months to the day after returning from his mission, as Steven was preparing to reenter BYU, he witnessed a terrible accident at 225 West 2230 north in Provo, Utah. Two employees of a local company were erecting a large metal sign near that street. Unfortunately, the mechanical boom they were operating from their service truck came in contact with the mega-sized 7200-volt power line that runs along 2230 North. When that current flashed down the boom to the truck, the employee working near it was immediately knocked unconscious, falling onto the electrified ground wire and onto other perhaps now highly charged metals that were nearby. The other employee, who had been operating the boom and had barely jumped to safety, called for medical assistance and then tried to free his colleague from the current.<br><br>Driving by this scene was Mr. Enthusiasm himself--big, handsome, fun-loving Steven Blake, BYU student, returned missionary, citizen. A wrestler and football player in high school, Steven, knowing that a human life was at stake, but perhaps not realizing that life would be his own, stopped his car and joined that employee in trying to muscle his colleague away from contact with the penetrating voltage. In doing so, both men were immediately knocked unconscious, the employee falling away from the truck but Steven falling forward onto the wire and highly charged soil near the rear of the truck. His body immediately began to convulse from the relentless electrical pulse surging through him.<br><br>Another valiant Samaritan happening by, Dave Conley of Salt Lake City, then tried to rescue Steven, but was immediately knocked back. He fell unconscious, free from the electrical field.<br><br>Emergency medical personnel soon arrived but were unable to free Steven from the current until after the power had finally been shut off. For some seventeen minutes Steven Blake--BYU student, returned missionary, citizen--lay with 7200 volts pounding through his muscular frame.<br><br>I sat in the Edgemont Fifth Ward Chapel one week ago this very moment and thought of Steven and thought of you and thought of the beginning of new school terms for us and for him.<br><br>"A great people is what you need for a great university," to paraphrase Mr. Wills. "Not those who wish to escape, or be soothed, but a people willing to pay and sacrifice and learn." Steven Blake's sacrifice seems an immense one this morning as I look at you and look at his family who are here with us. We could speak of what one should and should not do when a lethal current is exposed and in force. But that is not my purpose. My purpose today is only to pay tribute to "virtuous citizenship": "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).<br><br>I tell this story this morning for its Christian significance on a campus where we pledge and profess Christian belief. I submit to you that our effort this year must be perhaps different in degree but not in kind from the effort that a ragged bunch of irregulars made during a winter at Valley Forge, that a beleaguered band of pioneer outcasts made in these valleys for the privilege of freedom and worship and growth, and that Steven Blake made on behalf of seventy-year-old Johnny Wakamatsu. I submit to you that your devotion to your educational opportunity and the life of service that must follow it is to be different in degree but not in kind from that gift given by the Son of God himself, made for friend and foe alike--none of whom could possibly have comprehended the full meaning and majesty of the privilege he was providing them. In this academic year of presidential elections and bicentennial celebrations, I salute you, the students of Brigham Young University who have chosen to educate your minds, discipline your appetites, and serve, indeed sacrifice for your fellow men and women.<br><br>God bless you for being the generation you are, "fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners" (D&amp;amp;C 109:73). God bless you for wanting to be at your "most enlightened and alert," for preparing to live as "a great and glorious masterpiece." I pray for every blessing upon you this year as you strive to fill that full measure of your creation, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>emories - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sensing the importance of this occasion and knowing how valuable your time is, I have decided to speak upon a subject that is vastly important to all of us--that of making memories.<br><h2><b>Early Times</b></h2><br>It was forty-eight years ago that my brother and I arrived in this beautiful valley from Chicago, Illinois, and enrolled as freshman at BYU. We were two bewildered young men as we gazed at those majestic mountains surrounding this valley. As newcomers from the fertile flatlands and cornfields of the Midwest, we were warmly welcomed by friendly students, most of whom were members of the Church. Our parents wanted us to be in a spiritual setting that would enhance our academic pursuits, so they encouraged us to come to Provo for our college education.<br><br>My parents, as well as my brother and sister and I, were born in Germany. I was born in the city of Schneidemuhl. (I've always had a hard time trying to spell that name. Now if any of you can spell it, I think you are deserving of a degree from BYU.) Today, the name of the city has been changed to Pila, and it lies behind the Iron Curtain and is part of Poland. Because of escalating financial problems, and at the suggestion of the local priesthood leaders, many of the LDS people immigrated from Germany to the United States.<br><br>Upon arriving in the United States, we faced the devastating depression of 1929. We left unbelievable spiraling inflation in Germany and were immediately tossed into an economic depression in this country. Jobs were scarce, and my mother became the breadwinner as my dad looked anxiously day after day for work without success. He was unemployed for several years, and this caused him great discomfort.<br><br>As Nephi of old proclaimed, I was born of goodly parents. My father and mother were humble, prayerful, and obedient convert members of the Church. They always followed the counsel of the Church leaders. Their loyalty to the prophet and priesthood leaders was firmly rooted in their testimonies. They urged us to get as much education as possible--primarily because they had so little formal education themselves. They worked hard and long to help pay for our education, and I shall always be grateful for their sacrifice in our behalf.<br><br>Sister Sonnenberg and I have been blessed with seven children. In fact, six of them have received their degrees here. Their companions have also attended BYU, and so we are indebted to you, the administration, the faculty, and the Church for your contributions toward their academic pursuits. In turn, our children have blessed us with thirty-two grandchildren, and we hope, President Holland, that you will have room for them and can do for them what your predecessors have done for us.<br><h2><b>Precious Experiences</b></h2><br>Since receiving the call to be a General Authority on October 6, 1984, I've had the opportunity to labor among the Saints as a member of the European area presidency with Elders Joseph B. Wirthlin and Russell C. Taylor. It was a choice experience to labor and serve among the Saints in the countries of Europe and Africa. We've witnessed much growth in this area.<br><br>I would like to share with you some of the memories and experiences we had while serving in Europe. As we toured the Portugal Lisbon Mission, I recall hearing the story of Sister Asencao Frango. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin has also told her conversion story in a conference address in October 1986. Sister Frango lived in the city of Funchal, on Madeira Island. She had been a nun for twenty years. As a matter of fact, she was a mother superior at a home for poor children and orphans. Hearing of the gospel of Jesus Christ, she attended her first meeting in a member's garage with a dirt floor, but the spirit of the meeting touched her heart. The elders began teaching her the gospel, and she listened. She read the Book of Mormon and gained a strong testimony. Later she requested to be baptized. A year later she went to the Swiss Temple to receive her endowments. Since becoming a member of the Church, she has found a new dimension of happiness and purpose to life.<br><br>In Cardiff, Wales, we held a regional conference in St. David's Hall with Elders Boyd K. Packer and Neal A. Maxwell of the Council of the Twelve. The Saints from the Bristol area were also invited. The attendance was so large that we had to hold two sessions. The Spirit of the Lord prevailed as the members and visitors were enlightened by the testimony of these two special witnesses of Christ.<br><br>On another occasion, President Thomas S. Monson and his wife, Francis, came to Salzburg, Austria, for a regional conference. Over 4,000 Saints assembled in the concert hall, the Neues Grosfestspiel Haus, to hear an apostle of the Lord. It was the largest gathering of Saints in Austria.<br><br>Sister Sonnenberg and I were also privileged to attend the dedication of the Freiberg Temple. There we witnessed the gathering of a few thousand Saints who had come to participate in this great event. Most of them were from Germany, but some came from neighboring countries. The Freiberg Temple is beautiful, and the Saints in this area made many sacrifices for and behalf of those coming to the temple. Food and commodities were purchased months in advance by the local sisters in preparation for a dinner for the Brethren who would be attending the dedication. They were honored to have in attendance at the dedication President Hinckley and Elder Thomas S. Monson and their companions, and several members of the First Quorum of the Seventy along with their companions.<br><br>We witnessed the faith and dedication of these members of the Church. We heard their testimonies and their expressions of gratitude. We're grateful for the influence that they have had on our lives.<br><br>At the conclusion of the cornerstone laying and the dedication of that beautiful holy temple, we found it as difficult to say auf wiedersehen as they did. But the bus was waiting--tears filled their eyes as they waved their clean white handkerchiefs as a farewell gesture in hopes of a return visit. As we drove away, we looked back at the Saints as they lingered on the temple grounds. We thanked the Lord silently for this glorious spiritual experience--another memory.<br><br>From there, we had the opportunity of traveling with President Hinckley and Elder Monson to Friedricksdorf, where they broke ground and dedicated the land for the building of the first temple in West Germany. We also had the privilege of attending the open house of a beautiful temple in Sweden.<br><br>These precious experiences with the Saints of other countries have caused us to thank the Lord for his mercies unto the people of these lands and to us. As I think about these beautiful edifices that are being dedicated unto the Lord for the purpose of performing his sacred ordinances, I am reminded of a revelation found in D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4, which the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Ramus, Illinois, on July 12, 1843:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.</i><br><br>It is interesting to note that this revelation was given in a town that no longer exists. Section 130 of the Doctrine and Covenants was also given in Ramus, Illinois. Whether or not the town exists is of little importance. However, the revelations that came to the Prophet Joseph Smith there are applicable all over the world and will bless the Lord's children in every country where temples have been built.<br><br>The Saints who attend the temples are trained and taught the higher ordinances of the gospel. President Spencer W. Kimball said that "temples are built, in the first place, for the living and then for the dead." Temples promote a spirit of love in the family, in the home, in the missionary work, and for those who receive the endowment. They enhance the spirit of service and reverence. They enhance the spirit of service of obedience to the commandments and covenants of the Lord. Temples also bring forth the spirit of sacrifice and the spirit of order. You are fortunate to have this beautiful temple in Provo, and I would encourage you to attend as often as possible.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer said, "If we have participated in the ordinances of the gospel and have made our covenants with our Father in heaven, it does not really matter what other things we may have missed in this life. . . . We have not lived in vain." All other things of the world to other people will make no difference.<br><br>As I reflect upon the many experiences we have had in the past four years and cherish the memories we've made, I think of the opportunities each of you have to make memories of your experiences here at BYU. If I could invite you to do some things that would enlarge your perspective and strengthen your testimony, I would encourage you to keep the commandments of the Lord. In doing so, you will make memories that will enrich your lives in countless ways.<br><br>May I suggest that you first listen to the word of the Lord. The following revelation was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith as a voice of warning to the Saints during a special conference of elders of the Church in Hiram, Ohio, on November 1, 1831:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</i><br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</i><br><br><i>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear;</i><br><br><i>Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:1–2, 4–6, 11–12]<br><h2><b>Memories from the Pacific</b></h2><br>Recently we had the privilege of being in Samoa for its centennial celebration. It was one hundred years ago that Joseph Harry Dean and his wife and infant son set foot on Anuu and began to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. The centennial celebration marked the opening of the Samoa Mission in 1888. President Thomas S. Monson and Elder James E. Faust of the Council of the Twelve invited Joyce and me to accompany them on this historic occasion.<br><br>Thousands of people filled the Apia Park Stadium in Western Samoa. You had to come early in order to get a seat. The governor of Samoa attended, as well as the Speaker of the House, the lieutenant governor of American Samoa, and many other dignitaries and heads of state.<br><br>As President Monson spoke, he stated that "when God speaks and man obeys, that man will always be right." I watched the attentiveness of those near me as they listened to him--also evident when Elder Faust spoke. As they spoke, I thought of the Lord's admonition: "Whether by my own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>Then President Monson blessed the Saints by the power and authority of his holy calling. Thousands will be grateful for the testimonies and blessings given by the Brethren. The people came from the islands of Tutuila, Upola, and Savaii on this memorable occasion, and their hearts were filled. To us it was a most memorable experience.<br><br>You might be interested to learn that in Samoa there are now 50,699 members of the Church. In June of 1888 Elder Joseph Harry Dean accepted a call to serve the Lord as a witness of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Polynesian people. Since then, there have been forty-one mission presidents and over 4,100 missionaries that have served in Samoa, most of them local members.<br><br>The first person to be baptized was a man by the name of Samuela Manoa, a native Samoan who had waited twenty-five years for someone to come and baptize him with power and authority and to administer in the ordinances thereof. Today there are eleven stakes of Zion, and it is not uncommon to have 80 or 90 percent attendance at their stake conferences. The faith of these Polynesian Saints and their eagerness to build the kingdom of God is commendable.<br><br>Another memorable experience was in Micronesia in the islands of Tarawa and the Gilbert Islands. We felt the power of prayer in those people's lives. We witnessed the faith and dedication of the Saints in Fiji, where harmony is displayed among the members of the Church. Because of the political unrest in this country, the government leaders are asking, "How do you do it?"<br><br>The Church is growing in Vanuatu. Last year the branch president and his counselor and their wives went to the New Zealand Temple to be endowed and sealed. It was a great personal sacrifice and it took all of their savings. In fact, one of them sold his car. They couldn't afford to take their children because of the expensive airplane fare. They also attended a magnificent pageant on the grounds of that beautiful temple. They returned to Port Vila in Vanuatu with added dedication to build up the Church in that area. Two local missionaries have been called, and the work is expanding. As we visited these beautiful Melanesian people, we witnessed another miracle. A cyclone had swept through the island. Huge trees were uprooted and many, many buildings were destroyed, but the chapel was spared. There was no damage although two huge trees fell at the edge of the fence.<br><br>We witnessed the protective hand of the Lord on Rarotonga Island when a devastating cyclone severely damaged much of that island. On an emergency visit with President John Lasater, we saw how the Lord preserved our chapels. Cyclones are a way of life in the islands, but so is faith. The people's faith and courage are almost indescribable.<br><br>We have frequently gone to Tonga. On one visit we went to reorganize the Nuku'alofa Tonga South Stake. On Sunday evening following stake conference they had a special fireside where the king of Tonga was being honored on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. Members of the royal family as well as many other dignitaries from several countries were in attendance. The stake center was filled to capacity with over 1,200 people. Tongan music and the Spoken Word were presented. There was a Tongan choir of some 200 children, youth, and adults. At the appointed hour the king arrived and sat with regal dignity on a special chair. The king is head of the Wesleyan church. It was a wonderful experience to see and hear his granddaughter sing a solo to him, "I Am a Child of God." That young girl also sang with the choir and then sang, "I Love You, Grandpa." I think hearts were beating a little faster that day as we all felt the influence of the Spirit. I hope, with the passing of time, those memories will always remain fresh.<br><br>Elder James E. Faust was in attendance. Both he and I were asked to speak, and we bore our testimonies. After Elder Faust bore his testimony, he felt impressed to bless the king. The Saints and friends of the Church felt the power and authority of one who was called of God as a special witness.<br><br>The king responded graciously. At the conclusion of the fireside, the king personally greeted Elder and Sister Faust and Sister Sonnenberg and me and pronounced that Elder Faust is an apostle of the Church.<br><br>How grateful we were for the prayers and sustaining influence of the Spirit. Here was another choice experience that has been etched into our memory book.<br><br>The people of Polynesia have many talents and gifts. There is a great promise to the Polynesian people in 2 Nephi 10:21. The scripture says, "But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren."<br><br>Sister Sonnenberg and I have truly come to love these people who are our brethren.<br><br>Another memorable experience was when we toured the Tahiti Mission along with President George Hilton, the mission president, his wife, and Elder Victor Cave, the Regional Representative. We had to fly down to Rurutu Island, which is about three hours south of Papeete.<br><br>As we arrived on this remote island, we were greeted warmly with leis and love and sincere embraces. It's their way of showing "thanks for coming." As we drove along a lonely road, I learned that President Hilton had served a mission here as a young man some thirty years before. Now the Lord had called him to be the mission president. This man had blessed the Saints and bore witness to them for two years. To come again to help them now was exciting for him. He knew the language, the people, the Saints, and the missionaries. But most important, he knew the Lord and was leading this mission with love, kindness, and compassion.<br><br>We went to a small, improvised meetinghouse and held a wonderful testimony meeting. Sister Mitiara, the district Relief Society president, fed us and fed us and fed us. I wondered about the five loaves and two small fishes spoken of in John 6:9.<br><br>Sister Mitiara asked if we would visit her eighty-six-year-old elderly mother who was ill. At President Hilton's suggestion we went to her little adobe home. The outside of this humble home was beautiful with colorful flowers by the front steps. As we walked into the home, we saw only one chair and a bed or two. It was a very humble setting. Sister Mitiara's mother is not a member of the Church. As we walked into her bedroom, a sweet spontaneous smile came over her face. She spoke to us very quietly and with difficulty, but she recognized Dr. George Hilton. Her eyesight had been restored by him in Papeete six months before when he performed delicate retinal surgery on her. President Hilton has restored the sight to many people both spiritually and with his professional skills. The operation was done free of charge. She now recognized him and expressed her thanks. She then asked if we could give her a blessing by the power of the priesthood. President Hilton and I blessed this sweet lady in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. She thanked us, quietly and sincerely.<br><br>We then flew to Tubuai--another tiny island in the Pacific that is about an hour's flight from Rurutu. It was here on this island that Addison Pratt baptized the first convert in the Pacific, Ambrose Alexander, on June 15, 1844, just twelve days before the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyred in Carthage, Illinois. Addison Pratt was the first missionary to the South Pacific. He was a member of the Quorum of the Seventy and served valiantly to bring the light of the gospel to the Polynesian people. Today, we have over 252,000 members in the Pacific area, with fifty-eight stakes, eleven missions, almost five hundred buildings, and five temples. The Lord has truly blessed these people.<br><br>We have had many more memorable experiences that display courage, faith, and perseverance. We have seen and felt the love of the Maoris in New Zealand. Elder Matthew Cowley made a great contribution here, and they have a great love for him. The scripture "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6) describes his total commitment to these people and to the Lord.<br><br>While touring the New Zealand Christchurch Mission with President and Sister Dean Baxter, we were driving along a highway one day in a van. Two elders were in the front seat, the mission president and his wife in front of us, and Sister Sonnenberg and I in the back of the van. As we were driving along, I asked the elders to stop a short distance ahead so we could take a picture of some sheep grazing on the lush grass. We moved ahead about fifty yards and Sister Baxter got out of the van to take a picture. At that precise moment, unnoticed to us, a camper passed us going in the opposite direction. The camper stopped about a block behind us. At first the elders thought they were in distress or had car trouble. But to our amazement, while the rest of us were still in the van, the mission president looked behind the back seat and saw someone coming toward us. He immediately noticed that it was his brother and his wife. They had come to tour the North and South Island. Here, on a lonely road in New Zealand, a brother meets his brother from Utah. There were, of course, warm and happy embraces. President Baxter had said that he wanted his brother to meet us, but had wondered how this would ever be possible. Oh, yes, the Lord directs his servants.<br><br>Our visits among the Saints have been happy ones, and we have stored many memories of spiritual experiences.<br><br>Perhaps I can best describe the faith and testimony of these people by reading a poem by Shondelle Pratt. She's a wonderful, talented teenager. She has the kind of faith that is reflective of the Saints in Australia--a land that has been blessed abundantly by the Lord.<br><br><i>When the Savior came down to the earth,</i><br><i>He said he'd come again.</i><br><i>So we battled to stay righteous</i><br><i>Through the wind and stormy rain.</i><br><br><i>We kept the ten commandments,</i><br><i>And all did so abide.</i><br><i>But when he didn't come along,</i><br><i>Some of us began to slide.</i><br><br><i>Thru the stormy seas and billows</i><br><i>Of life's stony-crusted path,</i><br><i>We fought for straight and narrow,</i><br><i>Hoping that he would embark.</i><br><br><i>I've never, ever doubted,</i><br><i>Though sometimes I've had to think.</i><br><i>I know that he will come again--</i><br><i>I'll never have to blink.</i><br><br><i>It's hard to write a poem</i><br><i>On a person some can't see</i><br><i>And hear the things that he had done--</i><br><i>One time it was for me.</i><br><br><i>He struggled on that bloodied cross</i><br><i>For all of us, you see.</i><br><i>He did it so that we could live</i><br><i>With him eternally.</i><br><br><i>It's what my dreams describe him as</i><br><i>That keeps my feelings clear</i><br><i>And wants me to keep precious</i><br><i>All the things that I hold dear.</i><br><br><i>He has that special kind of face</i><br><i>That shines for all to see</i><br><i>And a special kind of wisdom</i><br><i>That makes you want to be</i><br><br><i>A person that's just like him,</i><br><i>With love and patience sweet,</i><br><i>And have all of his righteous ways</i><br><i>From his head down to his feet.</i><br><br><i>Someday I know I'll meet him,</i><br><i>And all round will abide</i><br><i>As one big happy family--</i><br><i>I'll be right by his side.</i><br><br><i>So just when life has let you down</i><br><i>And tempers are debating,</i><br><i>Don't take upon you worldly ways;</i><br><i>Remember, someone's waiting.</i><br><br>I have witnessed the gift of giving and the gift of gratitude. I've come to know some of the relatives and friends of Meli Mulipola (although I don't know him personally) of whom President Monson speaks. Two Polynesian women helped Meli Mulipola to the village and led the way. He had lost his eyesight but had heard of the restoration of the gospel. His life conformed to the teachings of the Savior.<br><br>One who held the sacred priesthood of God was visiting the small island in the Pacific. A blessing was given and tears fell from his sightless eyes and upon his lava-lava, or native dress. He dropped to his knees and prayed, "O God, thou knowest I am blind. Thy servants have blessed me that my sight may return. Whether in thy wisdom I see light or whether I see darkness all the days of my life, I will be eternally grateful for the truth of Thy gospel, which I now see and which provides the light of my life."<br><br>As a General Authority, we are that to all the Church, whether in South America, Asia, the United States, or the Philippines. We should have the same love and respect for all our brothers and sisters. And inasmuch as we have labored in Europe and the Pacific area, I elected to recount some of our memorable experiences there.<br><h2><b>As You Live, Learn All You Can</b></h2><br>The people of the Pacific and Europe are choice. They sing beautifully. They have the gift of courage, love, obedience, prayer, and faith that we have witnessed among you. They express and display a loyalty to the prophets of God. They are dedicated to serve their fellowmen and will go the extra mile.<br><br>As I think of the marvelous opportunities that you have here at BYU, I think of your motto: "Enter to learn, go forth to serve." To continually learn is part of the gospel plan. In the thirteenth article of faith it states: "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." Your education is an important part of your preparation for joy and service in the Lord's kingdom.<br><br>President Monson said:<br><br><i>The past is behind you, honor it.</i>br&amp;gt;<i>The future is ahead, prepare for it.</i><br><i>The present is here, live in it.</i><br><br>As you live, listen to the voice of the Lord. As you live, learn all you can. The more you listen, the more you learn, and the more your opportunity to serve will be enhanced.<br><br>The Lord has given many revelations concerning our learning experiences. Learn by studying the scriptures. I like what the scriptures teach us about learning:<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.</i>[Hebrews 5:8]<br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:29]<br><br><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</i>[Alma 37:35]<br><br><i>Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>Your time at BYU is short. I would say to you, "Relish the moment." And I would couple that with Psalms 118:24, "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it."<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said, "In all the world, Brigham Young University is the greatest institution of learning. . . . The uniqueness of Brigham Young University lies in its special role--education for eternity--which it must carry in addition to the usual tasks of a university. This means concern . . . for not only the 'whole man' but for the 'eternal man.'" (<i>Education for Eternity,</i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year [Provo, 12 September 1967], p. 1)<br><br>And in an address to the BYU faculty (12 September 1966, pp. 5–6), President Ernest L. Wilkinson said,<br><br><i>I hope this school can never be totally described in the terms of other universities, no matter how celebrated. Fundamentally our roots spring from Palmyra, rather than Cambridge. . . . If most institutions of higher learning aspire to be only communities of scholars, we are privileged to be also a congregation of disciples. . . .</i><br><br><i>My concern that men of letters and science at B.Y.U. be men of God before anything else must not be construed to support the substitution of rectitude rather than academic competence. . . . Our academic training must be as impeccable as our lives.</i><br><br>Listen, learn, live, and serve, and as you do so you will carve out memories that will be etched into your heart and soul.<br><br>One of our sons, Brent, expressed a thought of a commitment to service:<br><br><i>Resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the wrong. Sometime in life you will have been all of these.</i><br><br><i>With a personal vision, you are in the driver's seat. The clarity, context, and focus that you develop is powerful. Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. To make all your friends feel that they are special. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and expect only the best. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.</i><br><br>Our memories and experiences, our friendships and closeness that we have developed will last with us wherever we go. In closing, let me share with you a final thought for us all to consider.<br><br><i>I expect to pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now; let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</i>[Attributed to Stephen Grellet, 1773–1855]<br><br>I bear witness to you that this church is true, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I bear witness that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. I testify to you that President Ezra Taft Benson is a living prophet. I share my testimony with you, and bless you by the power and authority vested in me. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John Sonnenberg was a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was delivered at Brigham Young University on 25 September 1988.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>or the Covenant: Father Abraham&#039;s Promises - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Nelson and I are thrilled to be with you on this special occasion. Whenever we come to BYU and are privileged to rub shoulders with members of the faculty and student body, we are better for it.<br><br>In two days, people in this nation will set aside their usual labors and celebrate Thanksgiving Day. This custom fosters gratitude to God for the good things of life. Each one of you will offer your own expressions of gratitude in your own way, wherever you are. We have so much for which we are grateful--family, friends, food, freedom, faith--all of which come to us from a loving Father in Heaven.<br><br>On my list of things for which I am thankful are items that may not be on your list. I would especially like to express my gratitude for the privilege of being here today. In the past five weeks my calling has taken me to thirteen different nations on three different continents. So I'm grateful for the jet airplane and competent people who work to help us travel in safety. I'm pleased that I don't have jet lag. My poor brain has long since given up trying to keep track of which time zone I'm in. I find that if one travels eastward to Europe and then westward to the East, time zones get fuzzy anyway, and opposing jet lags hopefully just cancel out.<br><br>I am grateful also for the fact that wherever I travel, the reputation made by groups from Brigham Young University has preceded me. I salute cultural ambassadors of goodwill who represent this institution. What you have done is of inestimable value. Literally, the world is your campus.<br><br>Another observation for which I am grateful is that graduates from BYU are widely disseminated throughout the earth. Precious seedlings of faith blown by winds of responsibility reach fertile soil of opportunity in lands near and far.<br><br>Wherever I go in the world, I see amazing growth of the Church. People once uninformed are learning of the gospel. I am an eyewitness to fulfillment of the promise made to the Prophet Joseph Smith when the Lord said, "The ends of the earth shall inquire after they name" (D&amp;amp;C 122:1).<br><br>National governments once hostile to this Church are now cautiously opening doors because they have learned that doctrines restored through that great Prophet will strengthen citizens of their nations.<br><br>I would like to speak to each individual here with the hope that I may give you a new perspective of gratitude at Thanksgiving. Against a historical backdrop I should like to paint a mental picture that would allow you more fully to comprehend who you really are.<br><br>The panorama of history will extend so far back you will wonder if I have forgotten to relate my message to you. But if you'll pay careful attention and follow the thread of thought, you will see that the relationship is real. In fact, if you should view your own identity without this broader understanding, such limitation would constitute an unfortunate injustice.<br><h2><b>Going Back in Time</b></h2><br>Each one here no doubt has at one time or another had some sort of identity crisis. On those occasions one has wondered with truth introspection: "Who am I really? Why am I here? What am I to do?" To find identity, direction, and purpose, it helps to be reminded of the past.<br><br>Before we start, I'd like to give you a little quiz. Nothing you'd rather have today, is there? I won't ask for answers aloud, but perhaps you can silently answer these questions of even write them in your notes.<br><br>Who are your parents?<br><br>Where is your home?<br><br>Are you of Israel?<br><br>Are you Hebrew?<br><br>Are you related to Abraham? If so, how?<br><br>Are you Jewish?<br><br>To what countries do you trace your ancestry?<br><br>Do any of you trace your ancestry to Egypt?<br><br>To find answers, let's go back in a mental time tunnel. Before the world was made, "Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, . . . looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven" (D&amp;amp;C 38:1). The Lord had shown Abraham "the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones" (Abraham 3:22). We are no doubt among those he envisioned.<br><br>"And God saw these souls . . . and he said: These I will make my rulers; . . . Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born" (Abraham 3:23). Contemplating the plan to create an earth on which those spirits could dwell, our Heavenly Father said to those about him, "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).<br><br>The Creation was accomplished. The fall of Adam took place that man might be. Dispensations of the gospel were entrusted to Adam, to Enoch, to Noah, Abraham, and others. (see Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, comp. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City; Bookcraft, 1954], 1:161) Then the Savior of the world was born. Prior to his planned atonement, he ministered among them.<br><br>You may recall the conversation the Master had with Jews who questioned his knowledge about Abraham;<br><br><i>Then said the Jews unto</i>[Jesus],<i>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</i>[John 8:57–58]<br><br>"I am" was the name the Lord applied to himself.<br><h2><b>Abraham's Covenant</b></h2><br>After Abraham withstood the severe trial commanded of God in which Abraham was willing to offer his special son, Isaac, the Lord personally appeared and made a covenant with Abraham. Included were assurances that<br><br>1. Christ would come through the lineage of Abraham.<br><br>2. Abraham's posterity would receive certain lands as an inheritance (see Genesis 17; Galatians 3; Abraham 2).<br><br>3. All the nations of the earth would be blessed through his seed (see Genesis 17:7; Acts 3:25; 1 Nephi 15:18; 22:9; 3 Nephi 20:25, 27).<br><br>These divine declarations are known as the Abrahamic covenant.<br><br>So important were these promises that the Lord personally appeared to Isaac and renewed that covenant (see Genesis 26:1–4, 24). So important were these promises that the Lord personally appeared again to Jacob and reconfirmed that same covenant a third time to a third generation (see Genesis 28, 35:9–13, 48:3–4). Jacob's name was changed to Israel (see Genesis 35:9–10), so we may use the terms Jacob and Israel interchangeably.<br><br>Well, happily, as men are wont to do, Jacob fell in love. In an act I would not recommend today, Jacob kissed Rachel on their first date (see Genesis 29:11). But on that occasion Jacob also kissed her father (see Genesis 29:13). I wouldn't recommend that either. Concurrent kisses for both a father as well as his daughter would surely restrain any amorous enthusiasm. Jacob worked for years for the hand of his intended bride, Rachel. He asked Rachel's father for permission to marry her. But after agreeing, the father veiled faces, switched daughters, and gave his oldest girl, Leah. Her father cited the tradition of giving the hand of his first daughter before allowing the younger daughter to be married (see Genesis 29:26).<br><br>Later, Rachel and Jacob were permitted to marry. He worked another seven years for her. (That's even longer than waiting for a missionary today!) So great was his affection for Rachel that he described the period as "but a few days, for the love he had [for] her" (Genesis 29:20).<br><br>Leah bore sons Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. Meanwhile, Rachel was barren. So desirous was she of having children that she gave to Jacob her handmaiden, Bilhah, as another wife, with the expectation that children born to Bilhah would become Rachel's own, because Rachel owned Bilhah. Bilhah had been given to Rachel as a wedding gift by her father. Bilhah did conceive and gave birth to a son upon Rachel's knees (see Genesis 30:3). It was customary for names of babies to be selected by their mothers. "Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan" (Genesis 30:6). Dan in Hebrew language means "judge." Rachel wanted Dan judged as though he were her own offspring. Bilhah later bore a second son named Naphtali (see Genesis 30:8).<br><br>When Leah saw that pattern of surrogate motherhood successfully practiced by her sister, Leah decided to do the same. Her maid, Zilpah, was given to Jacob as a fourth wife, and she bore sons named Gad and Asher (see Genesis 30:9–13). Leah subsequently had two more sons named Issachar and Zebulun (see Genesis 35:23).<br><br>So Israel had ten sons before Rachel finally conceived and bore a son of her very own. She called his name Joseph (see Genesis 30:24). This name had a very special meaning. The word Joseph relates to the Hebrew word<i>yasaph</i>, meaning "to add." Rachel wanted all to know that this son was added to sons that she already had through her maid Bilhah. Joseph also relates to the Hebrew word<i>asaph</i>, which means "to gather" (see Genesis 30:24, footnote 24a in the LDS edition of the King James Version). The name and lineage of Joseph were destined to play an important later role in the gathering of Israel.<br><br>In time, Rachel conceived again. As they were traveling from Beth-el in the north to Bethlehem in the south, Rachel went into labor and experienced a fatal complication. Scriptures indicate that it was a particularly hard labor. She endured severe pain. The midwife announced that the baby was a boy and asked for a name. As Rachel was dying, she gave the baby the name Ben-oni (see Genesis 35:18), which means "son of my sorrow." Rachel then died and was buried just north of Bethlehem. Her husband was grief-stricken. I suppose he could not bear the thought of being reminded of the death of his beloved Rachel every time the name of the child was mentioned. So Jacob changed the name to Benjamin, which means "son of my right hand" (see Genesis 35:18). To me, this is one of the most tender love stories in all of holy writ.<br><h2><b>The Birthright</b></h2><br>This history takes on an additional dimension of importance when one considers the Hebrew law of primogeniture, or the birthright. Under this law, for example, if a man had three sons, his estate would be divided not three ways, but four, with a quarter going to each of the three sons and the fourth quarter going to the birthright son. To have the birthright meant power, property, and a measure of wealth to help defray the cost of managing the estate, to take care of any daughters and, who knows, maybe there would be a little left over for an executor's fee.<br><br>Being the first son, Reuben held the birthright. But he lost it because he defiled his father's bed. The question is, who was to get the birthright now? Was it to go to the second son, Simeon, or to any of the older boys? No! The Hebrew law of primogeniture required that the birthright go to the first son of the second wife. So the birthright went to Joseph (see 1 Chronicles 5:1–2). That's why he was given the coat of many colors. It wasn't because he was a favorite son, necessarily. It was because he was the birthright son. The coat carried that special designation. Of course, this infuriated his ten older brothers. You remember that they angrily sold Joseph into Egypt.<br><br>Joseph then married Asenath, and she gave birth to two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (see Genesis 41:45, 50–52).<br><br>Patriarchal blessings were as important then as they are now. When the father of these two sons felt that the time was appropriate for his boys to receive patriarchal blessings, he took them to patriarch Israel, who by that time was elderly. His eyes were described as "dim for age" (Genesis 48:10). (I presume he had cataracts.) You remember the story. Israel crossed his hands, put his right hand on the head of the younger Ephraim and his left hand on the head of Manasseh. Joseph tried to correct his father, but Israel persisted in his plan to give the patriarchal blessings in that order. He bestowed upon them blessings of greatness and conferred the birthright upon Ephraim (see Genesis 48:20; also D&amp;amp;C 133:34).<br><h2><b>Promises from the Past</b></h2><br>What does this ancient history have to do with you and your identity? It has everything to do with your identity. It also relates to the direction your lives may take, your choices, and your challenges. It should even influence your selection of your partner in marriage.<br><br>This connection became clear when in our latter-day, God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ came to earth. In addition to other actions of eternal consequence, they established once again the Abrahamic covenant, this time through the Prophet Joseph Smith. These are the words of the Lord:<br><br><i>And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say unto my servant Joseph [Smith]: In thee and in thy seed shall the kindred of the earth be blessed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:58; see also D&amp;amp;C 110:12]<br><br>The Master conferred upon Joseph Smith priesthood authority and the right to convey blessings of the Abrahamic covenant to others.<br><br>Joseph Smith, whose father's name was Joseph, had the same name as Joseph who was sold into Egypt, who millennia before had prophesied of Joseph Smith. This fact is documented in the Book of Mormon (see 2 Nephi 3:6–21). The name<i>Joseph</i>carried the connotation both that he was "added" to, and that his mission related to the "gathering" of Israel.<br><br>Have the promises of the Abrahamic covenant been fulfilled? Partially. Christ indeed has come from the seed of Abraham through the lineage of Judah. That line was entrusted with responsibility for preparation of the world for the first coming of the Lord. On the other hand, responsibility for preparation of leadership of the world for the second coming of the Lord was assigned to the lineage of Joseph, through Ephraim and Manasseh.<br><br>This remarkable fact was foreknown centuries before the birth of the Lord. In the earliest pages of the Book of Mormon this revelation is recorded:<br><br><i>Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[1 Nephi 15:18]<br><br>Now, what of the promise of possession of certain lands? Territorial inheritance destined for the sons of Israel provided property in the Holy Land for Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, Dan, Naphtali, and Benjamin.<br><br>But where was the inheritance for Joseph? From the Book of Mormon we learn that his inheritance was this land in the American hemisphere (see Ether 13:8)--identified as being choice above all other lands (see Ether 1:42, 10:28, 13:2; D&amp;amp;C 38:20). It was choice, but not necessarily from the standpoint of scenery or wealth. It was choice because it was chosen. America was to serve as the repository of sacred records written on metallic plates. It one day was to become the location for the restoration of the gospel. It was to host headquarters of the Lord's restored church.<br><br>Now do you see the importance of your patriarchal blessing? I hope each one of you has obtained one. It is precious. It is personal scripture to you. It declares your special lineage. It reminds you of your linkage with the past. And it will help you realize your future potential. Literally, you can lay claim upon the Lord for fulfillment of those blessings through your faithfulness.<br><br>Many of you have already qualified for endowment in the temple, and others will have that great privilege yet in the future. In the temple, with the authority of the sealing power, blessings of the Abrahamic covenant will be conferred. There, we may truly become heirs to all the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>Each of them had severe trials in life. So will each of us, without exception. Speaking to the Saints of our day, the Lord said,<br><br><i>They must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.</i><br><br><i>For all those who will not endure chastening . . . cannot be sanctified.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:4–5; see also D&amp;amp;C 136:31]<br><br>Submissive suffering is just as essential to our sanctification now as it was to patriarchs and prophets before. Knowing who we are helps us to endure our own Abrahamic tests.<br><h2><b>Heirs to the Promise</b></h2><br>Every man who has received the Melchizedek Priesthood has been foreordained from the foundations of the world for that privilege (see Alma 13:2-3). Every woman here today has been foredetermined to come at this time to participate in partnership in building up the Church and kingdom of God upon the earth as part of the preparation for the second coming of the Lord.<br><br>Now, let's review those questions I asked earlier. Are you of Israel? Absolutely. You are the "Hope of Israel, Zion's army, Children of the promised day" (<i>Hymns</i>, 1985, no. 259). Once you were spirit children in premortal realms with Elohim, Jehovah, Abraham, and other elect rulers-to-be. There you were held in reserve to come forth in this latter day when this great and marvelous work of restoration was to come forth.<br><br>Are you Hebrew? Yes, as scriptures define the term. You are related to Abraham, who was the great "Eber" from which the term Hebrew was derived (see Genesis 10:21, 14:13; see also 2 Corinthians 11:22).<br><br>Are you Jewish? That precious lineage may be claimed if your ancestors are from the loins of Judah. But most of us are of the lineage of Joseph through Ephraim or Manasseh. That was the lineage selected to pioneer the gathering of Israel, the seed to lead throughout the world in blessing all the nations of the earth.<br><br>Missionary work is only the beginning of that blessing. The fulfillment, the consummation, of those blessings comes as those who have entered the waters of baptism perfect their lives to the point that they may enter the holy temple. Receiving an endowment there seals members of the Church to the Abrahamic covenant.<br><br>Can you trace your lineage to Egypt? If your patriarchal blessing indicates that you are of the lineage of Joseph, Ephraim, Manasseh, or other descendents of Israel, yes, you may claim Egyptian ancestry.<br><br>And, of course, each of you is a child of God, created in his image. And you are disciples of his Beloved Son. If you really comprehend the power of that identity, other elements of your background matter less. Paul described this well. He said:<br><br><i>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</i><br><br><i>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</i>[Galatians 3:27–29]<br><br>The promise is the promise of the Abrahamic covenant.<br><br>The angel Moroni so taught the Prophet Joseph Smith. On September 21, 1823, Moroni appeared to the Prophet, quoting scripture from the fourth chapter of Malachi, "though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles" (JS--H 1:36). The difference in text from the Bible is highly significant. You recall it refers to the heart of the fathers being turned to the children, and the heart of the children being turned to the fathers (see Malachi 4:6). Joseph Smith tells us that Moroni<br><br><i>Quoted the fifth verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>He also quoted the next verse differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i>[JS--H 1:38-39]<br><br>The concept the Prophet was taught emphasized that the hearts of the children will become aware of the promises made to their fathers. Then, with that comprehension, the hearts of the children shall turn to their parents. That includes parents, grandparents, great-great-great-grandparents--including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Once we know who we are and the royal lineage of which we are a part, our actions and our direction in life will be more appropriate to our inheritance.<br><br>Now you can better understand this revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It applies to each one of us. He said:<br><br><i>Thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers--</i><br><br><i>For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God--</i><br><br><i>Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 86:8–11]<br><br>The Lord has called you. He has chosen you. You have inherited greatness of transcendent worth.<br><h2><b>"Children of the Prophets"</b></h2><br>Why are you here today? At least two great reasons emerge. One: You are to learn in your youth to keep the commandments of God (see Alma 37:35). There is no other way you can achieve your divine destiny. A prophet said:<br><br><i>As you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</i>[Alma 38:2]<br><br>Reason number two: Learn wisdom so that you can render significant service of worth to your fellowmen. How frustrating it would be to have desire only and little or no ability to help people. Prepare your minds and your hands so that you can qualify to serve people and bless their lives. Gain competence that others do not have. That takes work--it takes effort--but it is worth the price.<br><br>And for some, a third reason emerges. Here you may fall in love and find your eternal companion. Now with your understanding of the Abrahamic covenant, you may clearly see the importance of marrying within the covenant to obtain all the blessings of the covenant.<br><br>Long ago, when Jacob's parents pondered the risk of his dating certain ladies not of covenant Israel, their concern was evident. His mother, Rebekah, said to Isaac:<br><br><i>If Jacob take a wife . . . such as these which are of the daughters of the land</i>[and not of Israel],<i>what good shall my life do me?</i>[Genesis 27:46]<br><br>So today your parents and predecessors are pulling and praying for you. Be wise in selecting your companion. Keep courage to be morally clean. Let fidelity and trust distinguish all you do. Don't ever defile our chosen lineage or demean your boundless potential for greatness.<br><br>These words from the mouth of the Lord recorded in 3 Nephi may summarize my message today:<br><br><i>And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye mare of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[3 Nephi 20:25]<br><br>At Thanksgiving time, express gratitude to your Heavenly Father for blessings uniquely yours. Echo in your heart this prayerful plea recorded in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Take upon you the name of Christ; . . . humble yourselves . . . and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, . . . live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.</i>[Alma 34:38]<br><br>Gratefully add to your list of blessings thanks for the covenant--the Abrahamic covenant--by which you will be vital and precious participants in God's promise to bless all the nations of the earth through that choice seed.<br><br>I express my love and invoke the blessings of our Father in Heaven upon you--that you will reach the potential of your divine destiny. God bless you always, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.
