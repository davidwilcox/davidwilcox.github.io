<h1>ons and The Dauntless Spirit of Resolution - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a delight for me to be with you on this campus tonight. It makes me feel young to see you and be with you, and I commend you for choosing to be in attendance at this fireside. I suppose the title of "fireside" is a bit of a misnomer inasmuch as we're not allowed to start any open fires, but you do kindle great warmth in my heart, and I surely pray that the Spirit of the Lord will kindle a flame in yours.<br><br>We have just enjoyed another season of rejoicing and commemorating the birth of the Savior and, for most of us, the opportunity of renewing family ties. Almost all agree that December is a happy month, when we sing of "Peace on earth and good will toward men," but too many people leave this festive season and move into January with feelings of depression or discouragement. To some, January is foreboding: the beginning of the winter doldrums or, heaven forbid, something worse--the beginning of winter semester. Too many of us slip into a mind-set of grim resignation. We somberly look beyond January, and probably beyond February and March, to the warmer days of spring. In fact, we think if we look far enough, we can almost see the end of the school year.<br><br>I think January ought to be a happy month of the year. Of all people on the face of the earth, Latter-day Saints, with the perspective given them by the gospel, ought to be happy and optimistic. I hope that your very presence here today is indicative of your optimistic outlook. The start of a new semester and a new year gives you every reason to be happy, and I encourage you to feel that way tonight.<br><br>January always brings a renewed hope for personal and family progress in the coming year. It is the time of the year when people tend to set goals and make commitments--resolutions, if you will, New Year's resolutions. I am assuming that most of you made one or more resolutions last Wednesday as the new year began. I am also assuming, because that was all of four days ago, that you may have already bent a few of those resolutions, if not totally broken them. So perhaps our discussion of such a topic tonight is still timely--sort of a Sunday-night resolution to be a bit more resolved about the original ones made last Wednesday.<br><br>But that's all right. This is a gospel of repentance, and we need to be repenting and resolving. Indeed, the process of repenting, making commitments, and setting goals should be a continuous one, so there is nothing wrong with using this traditional time of the year to evaluate the past and plan the future. It is much like our personal prayers in which, while communicating with our Father in Heaven, we ponder our thoughts, words, and deeds of the day and seek help in our personal progress for the morrow. The practice of reviewing the past and setting new directions for the future is a very healthy one, a scripturally encouraging one, in which we can beneficially alter our lives. I commend the practice to you, especially if it is thoughtfully pursued and the resolutions made are made in righteousness, bringing behaviors and attitudes that truly bless your lives and the lives of others. Shakespeare once wrote that one should live so that "Eyes, / That borrow their behaviours from the great, / Grow great by your example and put on / The dauntless spirit of resolution" (<i>King John,</i>act 5, scene 1, lines 48–53).<br><br>Sometimes our resolutions are a part of the process of repentance from past sins--actual transgressions for which we need forgiveness. Sometimes our goals focus on less serious matters, such as errors of judgment or flaws in our personality that may not be sins as such but that we nevertheless desire to change. Yes, life offers a multitude of lessons and plenty of things to improve. It is wonderful to believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ, which encourages such lofty views and gives us every avenue to achieve them.<br><br>While true godly sorrow leads to repentance of sins, our reflections on the past should not be self-debasing nor generate self-doubt. Indeed, one of the signs of mature Latter-day Saint life is the ability to see a limitation in ourselves without letting it cast a shadow over all the many other good things we do and say. We read of, and sometimes know, individuals who are so self-critical that their attitude leads to extremes--even destructive behavior. It is almost as if they are compelled to belittle themselves.<br><br>I suppose it is inevitable that we will compare ourselves to others, but that is an unfortunate mortal tendency in us and seldom leads to anything very constructive. Usually we just get depressed, thinking everyone else is doing so well while we are not or has this or that quality we don't have. Why are we so hard on ourselves, knowing full well that everyone has problems and limitations, as well as strengths and talents? We would never let others be so hard on themselves, but we are certainly inclined to be hard on ourselves.<br><br>Let me use an example close at hand. I think of two young men who are both fine BYU basketball players. More important, they are both fine young men. But they are not alike in physical makeup or personal interests or academic majors or a hundred and one other differences that one person has from another. But we applaud that and understand it. Wouldn't it be foolish, even destructive, if these two men spent a lot of time wishing they were the other person? It would not help our basketball fortunes to have a nearly seven-foot man bringing the ball down the court nor one slightly over six feet playing the post position. Obviously, each of these young men has a task of his own, best suited to himself, and individual talents to develop.<br><br>If that is so obvious on the basketball court, why can't it be a little more obvious in life? Why do we allow ourselves to waste such energy and emotion comparing ourselves to others when our real task is to develop what we are and what we have, to be all that we can be.<br><br>This is especially true in matters of the spirit and salvation. We need to put our quest for perfection into context, including the kind of time that may be involved in such an effort.<br><br>Elder Joseph Fielding Smith offered this counsel:<br><br><i>Salvation does not come all at once; we are commanded to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect. It will take us ages to accomplish this end, for there will be greater progress beyond the grave, and it will be there that the faithful will overcome all things, and receive all things, even the fulness of the Father's glory.</i><br><br><i>I believe the Lord meant just what he said: that we should be perfect, as our Father in heaven is perfect. That will not come all at once, but line upon line, and precept upon precept, example upon example, and even then not as long as we live in this mortal life, for we will have to go even beyond the grave before we reach that perfection and shall be like God.</i>[<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, vol. 2 (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), p. 18]<br><br>It has always struck me as being sad that those among us who would not think of reprimanding our neighbor, much less a total stranger, for mistakes that have been made or weaknesses that might be evident, will nevertheless be cruel and unforgiving to themselves. When the scriptures say to judge righteously, that means with fairness and compassion and charity. That's how we must judge ourselves. We need to be patient and forgiving of ourselves, just as we must be patient and forgiving of others.<br><br>Of course, continual repentance followed by continual transgression isn't pleasing to the Lord, so we do have to be serious and responsible about our commitments. But God is usually more willing to forgive us than we are willing to forgive ourselves. It may not surprise you to know that God loves us more than we love ourselves. We are his creation, spirit children of a celestial birth, and we stand in the image of him whom we rightly call our Father. We ought never to be destructive in our criticism of others, but perhaps our greatest caution needs to be regarding the tendency to be destructive in the criticism we apply to ourselves.<br><br>As I understand it, in this mortal life the direction we are moving is more important than a particular degree of perfection. We all experience cycles of progression and times when we fight against these inevitable challenges of regression. Great blessings from the Lord attend our efforts to progress. And progression is certainly more effective if it is a process, a long-term commitment, rather than just a series of isolated and irregular events.<br><br>Let me illustrate the principle this way: Many of us have undoubtedly learned that studying a subject on a regular, daily basis provides a better and longer-lasting understanding of the subject than does last-minute "cramming." The first approach gives the mind time to process and ponder the information, allowing it to weigh the information in relation to other ideas and concepts. This makes it easier to incorporate the information into an overall perspective. Cramming, on the other hand, may fill the mind with facts and figures, but the information usually doesn't stay around very long. Using the often-quoted example, it is probably safe to say that most of you would prefer to undergo surgery at the hands of a physician who had not crammed for his exams, but one who had consistently and carefully continued his studies and practice with the solid determination to keep learning, keep growing, keep progressing. Such an approach is "good medicine" for us as well.<br><br>What I hope to encourage tonight is a long-term commitment to righteousness, a long-term view of our task. I hope to enlarge your vision of yourself and your potential. Goal setting is often considered synonymous with resolutions, especially New Year's resolutions. But in a recent article, James J. Mapes noted that the setting of goals is not nearly so important as setting a vision for individuals and organizations. Wisely selected goals are intermediate mile-posts that mark our course. Vision, on the other hand, is more far-reaching and exceeds the goals in importance. He noted this:<br><br><i>A vision is like a lighthouse which illuminates rather than limits, gives direction rather than destination. Almost all successful individuals and organizations have one thing in common: the power and depth of their vision. A positive, meaningful vision of the future supported by compelling goals provides purpose and direction in the present.</i>[James J. Mapes, "Foresight First,"<i>Sky Magazine,</i>September 1991, p. 96]<br><br>Spiritual survival for each son and daughter of God, not to mention the success of our New Year's resolutions, is like-wise predicated on a sound vision of eternal possibilities and promises. An often-quoted verse from Proverbs notes that "Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he" (Proverbs 29:18). Surely Solomon was inspired to associate happiness with vision.<br><br>In addition to vision there must be genuine effort, wholehearted effort, if change is to come. Consider this aspect of resolve, of genuine resolution. There is a phrase common in the Book of Mormon that describes what our efforts should entail. The phrase "full purpose of heart" is used by Nephi in his final counsel to our generation. He promises that if we will follow the Son of God with "full purpose of heart,"<i>then</i>the promised blessings will flow to us. Nephi clarifies the phrase by adding "acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:13). The "full purpose of heart" Nephi describes is much more fixed and determined than are the usual New Year's resolutions with many people. As a youth, Nephi had so committed his life that when his father described that difficult and dangerous errand of returning to Jerusalem for the brass plates, he could reply to his father:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:6]<br><br>We love to quote that scripture not only for the marvelous mental assent that it portrays, but because this young man immediately thereafter<i>demonstrated</i>that his actions were one with his resolve. His younger brother Jacob used the same words, "full purpose of heart," in his great invitation for all to repent and return (Jacob 6:5). Likewise, King Limhi promised his people that if they would "turn to the Lord with<i>full purpose of heart"</i>--and then added a dimension of commitment that will be of interest to students--"and serve him with all diligence of mind," they would be freed from their bondage (see Mosiah 7:33; emphasis added). Oh, that we could learn the important truth that it is impossible to have full purpose of heart without serving with all diligence of<i>mind.</i><br><br>I would hasten to add a word of caution that the type of strong, long-term resolution for both heart and mind does not necessarily come all at once. There are not many experiences like that of Saul with a blinding light from heaven, or of Moses with a burning bush, or of Alma hearing a voice of thunder. Those are the exceptions, not the rule. In working with most of us, God has our vision or perspective come line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, until the complete picture is before us.<br><br>When an individual has the light of the gospel, certainly progression in the right direction is made much, much easier. Our paths may frequently be strewn with difficulties and uncertainties, but the Light of Christ, illuminating the way, still gives assurance that the direction is correct. So it goes without saying that life-changing resolutions need a gospel vision or perspective, they need to be built on a foundation of stone, the rock of revelation. Resolutions without this underpinning are likely to be shortsighted and short-lived. So we should ponder gospel principles carefully as we plot our course through this year and throughout our lives.<br><br>The example of others who have gone ahead of us and faced our same problems can be invaluable. Look at the examples of the Savior and the prophets and other Christlike people to help you establish a pattern of resolve and successful living.<br><br>An experience when I was a small boy helped me to understand the principle of example:<br><br><i>It was on a summer day early in the morning. I was standing near the window. The curtains obstructed me from two little creatures out on the lawn. One was a large bird and the other a little bird, obviously just out of the nest. I saw the larger bird hop out on the lawn, then thump his feet and cock his head. He drew a big fat worm out of the lawn and came hopping back. The little bird opened its bill wide, but the big bird swallowed the worm.</i><br><br><i>Then I saw the big bird fly up into a tree. He pecked at the bark for a little while and came back with a big bug in his mouth. The little bird opened his beak wide, but the big bird swallowed the bug. There was squawking in protest.</i><br><br><i>The big bird flew away, and I didn't see it again, but I watched the little bird. After a while, the bird hopped out on the lawn, thumped its feet, cocked its head, and pulled a big worm out of the lawn.</i>[Howard W. Hunter,<i>CR,</i>April 1972, p. 95]<br><br>It is crucial to the survival of all who are "little birds" to learn practices and principles that will allow them to make their way in life and, indeed, fill the measure of their creation.<br><br>My young friends, it is appropriate at this time of the year that we reflect on the past and our future and on the direction of our lives. It is worthy to make resolutions regarding our behavior, goals, or pursuits. Such resolutions become mileposts to guide our lives, now and later. They will lead us past the kind of transitory fads that evaporate like the morning dew in the heat of the sun.<br><br>In conclusion, let us be reminded of the prophet-leader Joshua as one who became a sterling model of resolution. You will remember his fidelity to Moses. He later succeeded Moses in leading Israel for many years. There is an instructive verse in the early part of the book of Joshua where the Lord instructs this prophet in a way that can be helpful to us as we learn the principles and process of resolutions. The Lord said to Joshua:<br><br><i>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</i><br><br><i>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</i>[Joshua 1:7–8]<br><br>Joshua's long life of 110 years reflected that commitment. He did not wander to the right or to the left. In all things that are important, Joshua prospered. Near the end of his life he gave this marvelous challenge to his people that we learned as children in Primary:<br><br><i>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</i>[Joshua 24:14–15]<br><br>Where do you find the strength and wisdom to live with such conviction and resolution? You will find it as you search the scriptures; as you communicate with the Lord through prayer; as you conform your lives to the requirements of the gospel, including the sacred covenants you have entered into; as you listen to wise counsel of loving parents, priesthood leaders, and faithful teachers and instructors; as you continue your studies with all diligence of mind; and as you give ear to that still, small voice of the Comforter that speaks to the human heart.<br><br>May God bless you this coming year and always to have the spirit of firm resolution to live righteously, to know that God loves you and that repentance is always available to us if we are truly trying to improve. I thank the Lord for such a gospel of hope and progress, and I thank him for you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Howard W.

<h1>Persevere and When to Change Direction - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When my daughter Stephanie was five years old, I took her to register for kindergarten. When we arrived, she was invited to go into a classroom to "play games" with the teachers and other children. As a former elementary school teacher, I was certain the "games" were a method of testing for placement purposes.<br><br>A teacher was sitting just outside the room with a box of crayons and several sheets of blank paper, and I smiled confidently to myself from across the hall as Stephanie was asked to choose her favorite color and write her name. "She could write<i>all</i>the names in our family," I thought to myself. "She is so well prepared, there isn't anything in that room she can't handle!" But Stephanie just stood there. The teacher repeated the instructions, and again my daughter stood still, staring blankly at the box of crayons with her knees locked and hands behind her back.<br><br>In the sweet, patient voice that teachers use when they are beginning to feel slightly<i>im</i>patient, the teacher asked once more, "Stephanie, choose your favorite color, dear, and write your name on this piece of paper." I was about to come to my daughter's aid when the teacher kindly said, "That's okay. We will help you learn to write your name when you come to school in the fall." With all the restraint I could muster, I watched Stephanie move into the classroom with a teacher who believed my daughter did not know how to write her name.<br><br>On the way home I tried to ask as nonchalantly as possible why she had not written her name. "I couldn't," she replied. "The teacher said to choose my favorite color, and there wasn't a pink crayon in the box!"<br><br>I reflect on this incident often as I watch my children grow and observe life in general. How many times are we, as Heavenly Father's children, immobilized because the choice we had in mind for ourselves just isn't available to us, at least not at the time we want it?<br><br>Is progress halted when acceptance into a chosen major is denied, when enrollment in a required class is closed, when a desired job doesn't come through, when that dream date doesn't progress beyond friendship, or when the money hoped for isn't there? Are we ever, for reasons that are hard to understand or beyond our control, faced with a set of circumstances that we did not have in mind for ourselves? In other words, what happens when we look in the box and the pink crayon just isn't there? It is so easy to lock our knees, put our hands behind our back, and do nothing when things wished for and dreamed about are beyond our reach. But to do so would defy the very reason we are placed here on this earth. As hard as it sometimes is to understand, stumbling blocks are essential to our progression.<br><br>Remember what the Lord said: "If thou art called to pass through [some] tribulation . . . know . . . that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.5-7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 122:5–7</a></span>).<br><br>I have often wondered how Joseph of old must have felt as his brothers sold him into Egypt. Did he think that the good life was all over for him, that he would never again experience joy? What about Abraham and Isaac? Did they wonder why that horrible, sacrificial commandment had fallen to them? How did Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Hannah feel as they bore the stigma of being barren, when in those days it was interpreted as a sign of God's displeasure? How did Lehi and Sariah feel as they fled from their home and friends in Jerusalem to live in the wilderness? And in this dispensation, would Hyrum and Joseph ever have chosen the difficulties they faced?<br><br>In each of these cases, as we observe the lives of men and women in scripture, it is easy to see how people can triumph over adversity. But in our own everyday lives it is often difficult to see beyond our own frustrations, to remain focused, to see the end from the beginning.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott wisely instructed in the October 1991 general conference:<br><br><i>Trust</i>[the Lord],<i>even when in eternal perspective it temporarily hurts very much. Have patience when you are asked to wait when you want immediate action. . . . The path you are to walk through life may be very different from others. You may not always know why He does what He does, but you</i>can<i>know that He is perfectly just and perfectly merciful.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/11/obtaining-help-from-the-lord?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Obtaining Help from the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 86; emphasis added</a></span>]<br><br>When my son Tom was twelve, his dream was to be a professional basketball player. Even though he practiced into the night, he was worried that he wasn't the best on his team and even more worried that he was too short. I remember one night when he asked me, "What will happen to me if I don't reach my goal?" We talked for a long time about choices and individual differences, about challenges and how to know when to persevere and when to change direction.<br><br>Tom made the high school team, but when it became apparent that there were other things he could do better, he changed direction. The crayon he would have chosen as a teenager just wasn't there for him. He had to color his life with other choices. At twelve he thought his life would be worthless if he couldn't play pro ball. At twenty-seven he feels successful in what he is doing and is happy in his profession.<br><br>Life is like that, and what we might want at twelve or twenty or forty-two or even seventy-two might have to be adapted to the opportunities and options that are available to us at the time.<br><br>A few years ago my sister and I were walking along the beach when we began a very serious talk about life, its challenges, and our growing ability to handle whatever came to us. "I think I have lived long enough now that I could handle any challenge given me," I naively stated.<br><br>"I think I could, too," was my sister's quick reply.<br><br>Then the question that I will remember forever came from her: "Janet, what would be your most difficult challenge?"<br><br>I didn't even need to think. I already knew. "The hardest thing for me," I began, "would be the death of my husband. I can't imagine life without Rex."<br><br>"That would be hard," she answered, "but I think divorce would be even more difficult for me."<br><br>The preposterousness of our fears was interesting. Rex was running marathons and the picture of health. My sister's marriage seemed very much intact, and so, of course, we laughed at suggestions that couldn't possibly become realities.<br><br>Just eight months later Rex lay near death in a hospital and my sister's divorce proceedings had begun. Remembering that day and the year that followed will always bring back bittersweet memories for me. My sister and I most certainly would not have chosen those colors from our box of choices, but we had to pull our lives together from the colors that were there. Today she is happy in a new marriage to a wonderful man, and my life with Rex is rich and full. My choice would not have been to experience what was given me to do, yet, as a result, each day is filled with deeper meaning, greater understanding, and new insights. If I could trade it all back now and take the challenges away, I would do so in a minute. I don't like the fact that my husband has cancer. It is definitely a deviation from the life I had in mind for us. But if I<i>could</i>turn back the clock, would I also have to trade in what I have learned? I wouldn't want to give that part back. Always having our first choice might mean giving up unknown benefits. As Emerson said, "For everything you have missed, you have gained something else" (<i>Essays: First Series</i>[1841], "Compensation").<br><br>Let me share with you part of a letter someone wrote after hearing the story of Stephanie and her crayons.<br><br><i>I don't have all the colors of crayons that I want--but I do have all the colors that I need. When I need new or different colors in my life, Heavenly Father will make sure that I have them. I know that he will never give me a challenge beyond my reach or beyond the tools he has given me to work with. I also know that the challenges and trials I have are in reality blessings, and I will be better and stronger for having gone through them.</i><br><br>I bear my testimony that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers, that he will help us through life's challenges because he loves us and wants us to return to him. It is my prayer that we will color our lives in a beautiful way with whatever colors are available to us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E. Lee, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 14 January 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>hat Change, Things that Don&#039;t: Absolute Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The title of my talk today is "Things That Change, and Things That Don't." With regard to things that change, I would like to look at two separate categories: first, things that change within the Church; and second, things that change within our individual lives.<br><br>The changes that have occurred and are presently occurring in the Church are of epic proportions: prophecy fulfilling, mind-boggling, and--for those of us who are convinced that the Restoration is a reality--thrilling. Let me first tell you about an incident in my own life, and then I'll give you some figures.<br><br>Sometime about 1958 or '59, a statistics professor at Brigham Young University named Howard Nielson--who later became a congressman from this district--did a statistical study and projected probable Church membership by the end of the twentieth century. At that time, the Church had something in excess of one million members. His projection was that by the year 2000 the membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would be in the range of six million people.<br><br>I remember my reactions at the time. In part, I felt a sense of pride and gratitude that the Lord's work would have progressed so remarkably. But I also concluded that it just could never happen. In my view, increasing the Church membership by four-or fivefold in just forty years would present logistical, leadership, and financial problems of such magnitude that the Church would never be able to deal with them.<br><br>Well, so much for my ability to see the future. Here we are almost a decade short of that projected time when we would have six million people, and we have already exceeded that figure by two million. But I was certainly right in one respect: The leadership, logistical, and financial adjustments that the Church and its members have had to make have been massive. When Professor Nielson made his projections in the late 1950s, we had thirteen temples. Today we have about three and a half times that many--forty-four. Even more impressive has been the increase in the number of missionaries and the fruits of their efforts, measured by the number of convert baptisms. When I served as a missionary in the mid-to late 1950s, there were about 5,600 of us worldwide. Today, there are some 45,000, and during the calendar year 1990, those missionaries baptized 330,000 new converts, many of them in the twenty-five countries in which just six years ago we had no missionaries at all.<br><br>Particularly impressive--and particularly gratifying to me personally--has been the Church's experience in my own field of missionary labor. During the wonderful two and a half years that I spent knocking on doors in Mexico, there were maybe as many as a dozen branches that had sufficient leadership and membership strength that they could possibly have qualified as wards. Today--just three and a half decades later--Mexico has 124 stakes, which is twenty more than we organized in the entire Church during our first 100 years.<br><br>One of the things that has not changed over that time is my own inability to fathom the impact of what the future probably holds and how all of us as Church members will be able to adapt to it. Would anyone among us be willing to assume that we have now reached or will at any time in the future reach some kind of constant membership plateau--or even that our annual rate of growth will ever permanently level out? There is no enrollment ceiling on Church membership. I have reviewed for you the numbers that have characterized the Church's growth over a period of just over thirty years. If the number of missionaries has increased sevenfold over that time, what is it going to be over the next thirty? And with what effects on the Church and its members? As I say, my mind has difficulty even coming to grips with those issues, much less supplying any kind of answers. The real solution, I think, lies in other, more important things that do not change, a subject to which I will turn shortly.<br><br>But first, I want to talk about things that change within our individual lives. I had an experience recently that provided a simple reminder that things do indeed change for each of us. About two months ago I was in the nation's capital for some NCAA meetings. One afternoon I took an hour to run along Rock Creek Parkway, which was one of my two or three favorite running courses when I worked in Washington from 1981 to 1985. Last November, as I churned along that beautiful wooded path to the side of the creek that gives Rock Creek Parkway its name, my mind turned back to so many occasions when over those five years I had bounced along that path either by myself or with friends.<br><br>There was one very noticeable difference. In those days, I was one of the terrors of the parkway. My energy seemed boundless, and I took almost fiendish delight in passing large numbers of people. Last fall I remembered those earlier days and could not help contrasting them with my circumstance now. I still love to run. I do it regularly, with the same beneficial consequences to my physical and emotional health that I have always experienced. And, as a social event, it is still as pleasant as it ever was. But I am just not as good at it as I used to be. Now I am the passee, not the passer. The only people I ever pass are either in their eighties or out strolling their pet turtles. Two months ago, as I wended my way along the course that over the years I enjoyed so much, it came home to me that whatever the reason or combination of causes, those days when eight minutes to the mile was a comfortable pace, and six-minute miles were within my capacity, are probably gone forever.<br><br>One level of analysis--and, frankly, I think a correct one--tells me that it is of little consequence that my comfortable jogging pace is noticeably slower than it was just a few years ago. Certainly it will have no impact on our national debt, on crime rates in the large cities, on spreading the gospel to Eastern European countries, or on my ability to do my job as president of BYU. And in any event, even in my better days my performance as a runner didn't turn any heads. A six-minute mile is not going to be written up in the sports pages. But as I contrasted the way things are now with the way they were some years ago, that simple little experience last November was for me a very powerful reminder that in our individual lives there are things that change, and when they do, some change irrevocably.<br><br>Each of you has already had to deal with some rather large changes in your own lives: leaving home to go to BYU or on a mission; returning from a mission; a BYU class that was more difficult or a grade that was lower than you would have ever thought possible during your high school days; no money to fix a car that breaks down (and a father who very helpfully reminds you of his advice that you never should have taken a car to college in the first place); or a boyfriend or a girlfriend who doesn't have quite the level of fondness for you that you have for him or her.<br><br>Some of the greatest challenges in adjusting to change have to do with the simple process of moving from one year to the next. A friend of mine told me that she had picked a dentist because she thought she recognized his name as one of her high school classmates. But when she saw him, she said to herself, "No way did I go to high school with this old man." As he began to talk to her though, she concluded that her initial impression had been correct, and as she left she said, "I'm sure that you and I were at Highland High School at the same time."<br><br>His response was, "Why that's fascinating. And what did you teach?"<br><br>Very simply, for everyone of us changes are inevitable. Some of them we can anticipate; many we cannot. Many are fulfilling and joyful; some are devastating. The important issue is not whether changes will occur, because inevitably they will. The only real issue is how well we deal with them.<br><br>Among the best antidotes to the adverse consequences of things that change in our lives are things that don't change--which is the final subject that I want to discuss with you.<br><br>I begin from the premise that there are in this life absolutes and constant values that do not change because they are always true, always certain, and always reliable regardless of time, place, or other circumstances. Some of them are principles of revealed doctrine such as prophecy, revelation, restoration. Some are guides for living, which, if we observe them, will make our lives happier and more satisfying--outstanding examples are moral cleanliness and the Word of Wisdom. I want to tell you, brothers and sisters, that there are absolutes, verities that do not change no matter what else in life may change. They constitute the anchors to which we ought to tie the vessels of our souls.<br><br>Throughout your lives, you will come across some people who will assure you with great solemnity that there is no such thing as an absolute. In these people's view, everything is relative. All of life's values, decisions, and principles are subject to what lawyers call case-to-case balancing. Under that view, truth is determined not at all by stable verities that do not change from one context to the next, but rather on the particular facts, circumstances, and competing considerations that obtain and arise in each individual instance. Most of those people are very sincere. And all of them are dead wrong. Their attacks and assertions in this respect go beyond doctrines and practices unique to Latter-day Saints.<br><br>It is distressing, for example, to see Bible scholars and others wandering into a wilderness of doubt and questioning about subjects that ought be free from either doubt or question. Professor Robert Matthews of our religion faculty, in an address at last year's Sidney B. Sperry Symposium, reviewed news reports of activities and conclusions from a group of about 200 Bible scholars and Christian ministers who have met every six months in several major U.S. cities over the past five years. Among other conclusions, they assert that the Savior did not deliver the Sermon on the Mount, did not walk on the water, did not speak the Beatitudes nor the Lord's Prayer, and did not pray against temptation in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>There are other examples. You will hear them during your lifetime. I promise that you will. You will hear these scholarly assertions, many of them well-intentioned, that call into question the very foundation stones of our religion. They relate not only to Jesus Christ's bona fides, as reported in the New Testament, but also to prophecy, including that in the Old Testament. They relate to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, priesthood, and modern revelation. In some people's view, everything is up for grabs and nothing is fixed.<br><br>There is nothing more important for each of you to do than build a firm, personal testimony that there are in this life some absolutes, things that never change, regardless of time, place, or circumstances. They are eternal truths, eternal principles--and, as Paul tells us, they are and will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.<br><br>Given the importance of building such a testimony, how do we go about it? How do we establish these absolutes as our own personal foundation stones? Let me suggest two different approaches. They involve different tools but are in the final analysis mutually supportive of each other. The best learning occurs when these two approaches are used in tandem with each other, as clarified by such well-known scriptures as Moroni 10:4–5 and section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>One of these approaches is to give it our best objective, intellectual effort. Use the same tools of rational analysis that have been so key to your daily university studies here and then ask yourselves if it makes common sense, if it stands the test of rationality. I have thought for decades, and I still do, that the best test in that respect is the Book of Mormon--not the only one, but, for me at least, the most obvious. For me, it simply defies all reason that that book, with all of its complexities--complex names, history, human interrelationships, and particularly its doctrine--could possibly have been written by a man in his early twenties over the space of a few months. Moreover, it is a book that has withstood the test of time. It has been with us now for more than 160 years, and notwithstanding repeated and vigorous assaults over those entire sixteen decades, the worldwide influence of the Book of Mormon has continually expanded.<br><br>And so I urge you, whether it is the divinity of the Book of Mormon or any other important question, religious or other, reason it out in your own mind and do the best job that you can to come to some rational, logical conclusions. That is a good way to tie your lives to some absolutes. But not the best. Real conviction concerning absolutes that are essential to our stability, happiness, and eternal salvation can come only through additional processes beyond those of reason, logic, and mental exercise. Moroni told us how to do it.<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i>[Moroni 10:4–5]<br><br>In short, the final vindication for absolutes in this life necessarily comes through a process that is itself one of those absolutes--revelation.<br><br>Let me end with my own personal testimony and assurance to you that there are absolutes. Some of these pertain to the way we conduct our lives. Honesty and integrity will never go out of style. And any violation of the Word of Wisdom or principles of sexual morality will never be anything but sinful, wrongful, and harmful to our eternal welfare and to our happiness in this life.<br><br>Other absolutes are rooted exclusively in doctrine. Let me mention just a few.<br><br>1. Jesus Christ is the Savior of the World. He is not just a very smart man and a very good philosopher. He is the literal Son of God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament. Regardless of what so-called Christian ministers and advocates tell us, he is exactly what he tells us he is. Peter's testimony, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," is unequivocal and straightforward (Matthew 16:16). It is just as correct and just as reliable today as it was 2,000 years ago.<br><br>2. The Book of Mormon is also exactly what it purports to be--scripture. It is a divinely inspired record, kept by prophets and restored to the earth through divine persons and processes in these last days. And its principal purpose is to bring to the world a new testimony of Jesus Christ and his divinity.<br><br>3. In these last days, Heavenly Father has again spoken to his children here on earth through living prophets. And they are prophets--not just good, wise, and virtuous men whose lives we can emulate, but literally our Heavenly Father's representatives here on earth. Through them he speaks to us--his children. Other related absolutes include prophecy, revelation, and both the need for and also the existence of divine authority.<br><br>The Church and its members will continue to grow and be successful and happy so long as we recognize and incorporate into our lives these and other absolutes. Our ability to maintain ourselves in the face of changing circumstances and a changing world will depend principally on our ability to build our house on those things that do not change. This is my personal testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>e Christ—Our Master and More - Russell M. Nelson - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Nelson and I are very grateful to be with you. And we are a bit surprised to see so many here to commemorate Groundhog Day! We appreciate the attendance of President Rex E. Lee, President Kerry Romesburg, their companions, and associates from Brigham Young University and the Utah Valley Community College. We are also thankful for stake presidents and bishops and their partners and all who give so much that students and welcome visitors may be edified here.<br><br>Tonight's meeting concludes the annual Book of Mormon Symposium, which has focused intensively on the book of Helaman and the first ten chapters of 3 Nephi. I find it intriguing that scholars can feast for days on a banquet based on less than sixty printed pages. It is somewhat reminiscent of another phenomenon that I have also found to be most fascinating. I once regularly attended meetings of the American Heart Association, mingling with thousands of fellow scientists from many institutions and diverse disciplines, all congregated to learn more about the human heart. Surely God's gifts are great, and their importance is infinite! How blessed we are to be recipients of his word and of his works.<br><br>My lifelong interest in the human heart took an unexpected turn in April 1984, when I was called to leave the operating room of the hospital and enter the upper room of the temple. There I became an ordained apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. I did not seek such a call but have humbly tried to be worthy of that trust and privilege of being his representative, now hoping to mend hearts spiritually as I previously did surgically.<br><br>So I come to you as one who has been called, sustained, and ordained--one of the twelve special witnesses of our Lord and Master. In speaking with you, I sense our mutual desire and sacred responsibility to follow this vital theme from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ,</i>[and]<i>we prophesy of Christ.</i>[2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>We honor him as the most important individual ever to live on Planet Earth. He is Jesus the Christ--our Master and more. He has numerous names, titles, and responsibilities, all of eternal significance (for example, see Daniel H. Ludlow, "Jesus Christ Is Basis of LDS Beliefs,"<i>Church News,</i>29 March 1980). Under the heading "Jesus Christ," the Topical Guide in the King James Version of the LDS edition of the Holy Bible has eighteen pages (pp. 240–58) filled with references listed under fifty-seven subheadings. In the time allotted we could not fully consider or comprehend all of these important facets of his life. But this evening I would like to review, even briefly, ten of those mighty responsibilities of Jesus the Christ. You may choose to number them in your notes, but I will not do so--not wanting to imply any order of priority--because all that he accomplished was equally supernal in scope.<br><h2><b>Creator</b></h2><br>Under the direction of the Father, Jesus bore the responsibility of Creator. His title was the<i>Word--</i>spelled with a capital W. In the Greek language of the New Testament, that<i>Word</i>was<i>Logos,</i>or "Divine Expression." It was another name for the Master. That terminology may seem strange, but it is so reasonable. We use words to convey our expression to others. So Jesus was the "Word" or "Expression" of his Father to the world. The gospel of John begins with this important proclamation:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</i>[John 1:1–3; see also D&amp;amp;C 93:21]<br><br>The book of Helaman records similar testimony declaring that "Jesus Christ [is] the Creator of all things from the beginning" (Helaman 14:12).<br><br>Another clarifying quotation came from Moses:<br><br><i>The Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things. . . .</i><br><br><i>And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.</i>[Moses 1:31–33]<br><br>In modern revelation, Jesus' responsibility as Creator of many worlds is again affirmed:<br><br><i>Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation--</i><br><br><i>The light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men.</i><br><br><i>The worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:8–10; see also Hebrews 1:2; 1 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Nephi 9:5; 3 Nephi 9:15; D&amp;amp;C 76:23–24; 88:42–48; 101:32–34]<br><br>This hallowed Creator provided that each of us could have a physical body, uniquely individual, yet in many respects comparable to every other human body. Just as a well-educated musician can recognize the composer of a symphony by its style and structure, so a well-educated surgeon can recognize the creator of human beings by the similarity of style and structure of our anatomy. Individual variations notwithstanding, this similarity provides additional evidence and deep spiritual confirmation of our divine creation by our same Creator. It enhances the understanding of our relationship to him:<br><br><i>The Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them.</i><br><br><i>And the Gods said: We will bless them.</i>[Abraham 4:27–28]<br><br>Indeed, they have blessed each of us. Our bodies can repair and defend themselves. They regenerate new cells to replace old ones. Our bodies carry seeds that allow reproduction of our own kind with our unique individual characteristics. Little wonder our Creator is also known as the Great Physician (see Matthew 9:12)--able to heal the sick (see 3 Nephi 9:13; D&amp;amp;C 35:9; 42:48–51), restore sight to the blind (see John 9:1–11), unstop ears of the deaf (see Isaiah 35:5; 3 Nephi 26:15), and raise the dead (see Matthew 9:23–26; John 11:5–45). And in these latter days, he has revealed a code of health known as the Word of Wisdom that has blessed the lives of all who have obeyed those teachings in faith. So we honor Jesus as our Creator, divinely directed by his Father.<br><h2><b>Jehovah</b></h2><br>Jesus was Jehovah. This sacred title is recorded only four times in the King James version of the Holy Bible (see Exodus 6:3; Psalms 83:18; Isaiah 12:2; 26:4). The use of this holy name is also confirmed in modern scripture (see Moroni 10:34; D&amp;amp;C 109:68; 110:3; 128:9).<i>Jehovah</i>is derived from the Hebrew word<i>hayah,</i>which means "to be" or "to exist." A form of the word<i>hayah</i>in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament was translated into English as "I AM" (Exodus 3:14). Remarkably,<i>I AM</i>was used by Jehovah as a name for himself (for example, see D&amp;amp;C 29:1; 38:1; 39:1). Listen to this intriguing dialogue from the Old Testament. Moses had just received a divine appointment that he did not seek--a commission to lead the children of Israel out of bondage. The scene takes place atop Mount Sinai:<br><br><i>Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? . . .</i>[No doubt Moses felt inadequate for his calling, even as you and I may feel when given a challenging assignment.]<br><br><i>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</i><br><br><i>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</i><br><br><i>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever.</i>[Exodus 3:11, 13–15]<br><br>Jehovah had thus revealed to Moses this very name that he had meekly and modestly chosen for his own premortal identification--I AM.<br><br>Later, in his mortal ministry, Jesus occasionally repeated this name. Do you remember his terse response to tormenting questioners? Note the double meaning in his reply:<br><br><i>The high priest asked him, . . . Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said, I am.</i>[Mark 14:61–62]<br><br>He was declaring both his lineage and his name.<br><br>Another instance occurred when Jesus was taunted about his acquaintanceship with Abraham:<br><br><i>Then said the Jews unto him, . . . hast thou seen Abraham?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</i>[John 8:57–58]<br><br>Jehovah --the Great I AM, God of the Old Testament--clearly identified himself when the resurrected Jesus personally appeared in his glory to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836. I quote from their written testimony:<br><br><i>We saw the Lord standing upon the breast-work of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.</i><br><br><i>His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the</i>voice of Jehovah,<i>saying:</i><br><br><i>I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 110:2–4; emphasis added; see also D&amp;amp;C 76:23]<br><br>Jesus fulfilled his responsibility as Jehovah, "the Great I AM," with eternal consequence.<br><h2><b>Advocate with the Father</b></h2><br>Jesus is our Advocate with the Father (see 1 John 2:1; D&amp;amp;C 29:5; 32:3; 45:3; 110:4). The word<i>advocate</i>comes from Latin roots meaning a "voice for," or "one who pleads for another." Other related terms are used in scripture, such as<i>intercessor</i>or<i>mediator</i>(see also 1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Nephi 2:28; D&amp;amp;C 76:69). From the Book of Mormon we learn that this responsibility was foreseen before his birth:<br><br>[Jesus]<i>shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</i>[2 Nephi 2:9]<br><br>This mission was clearly evident in the compassionate intercessory prayer of Jesus. Picture him in your mind, kneeling in fervent supplication. Listen to the beautiful language of his prayer. Sense his feeling for his weighty responsibility as mediator:<br><br><i>I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</i><br><br><i>Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</i><br><br><i>For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</i><br><br><i>I pray for them.</i>[John 17:6–9]<br><br>He is also known as the mediator of the new testament or covenant (see Hebrews 9:15; 12:24). Comprehending him as our advocate-intercessor-mediator with the Father gives us assurance of his unequaled understanding, justice, and mercy (see Alma 7:12).<br><h2><b>Immanuel</b></h2><br>Jesus was foreordained to be the promised Immanuel. Remember Isaiah's remarkable prophecy?<br><br><i>The Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</i>[Isaiah 7:14]<br><br>Fulfillment of that prophecy was not just unlikely--it was humanly impossible! Incredible! Everyone knew that a virgin could not bear a child. And then for that child to be given such a pretentious name was doubly daring! The Hebrew name that Isaiah announced--<i>Immanuel--</i>literally means "with us [is] God!"<br><br>That holy name was subsequently given to Jesus in the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants (see Matthew 1:23; 2 Nephi 17:14; D&amp;amp;C 128:22).<br><br>Immanuel could be such only at the will of his Father.<br><h2><b>Son of God</b></h2><br>Jesus alone bore his responsibility as the Son of God--the Only Begotten Son of the Father (see John 1:14, 18; 3:16). Jesus was literally "the Son of the Highest" (Luke 1:32, 35). In more than a dozen verses of scripture, the solemn word of God the Father bears testimony that Jesus was truly his Beloved Son. That solemn testimony was often coupled with God's pleading for mankind to hear and obey the voice of his revered Son (see Matthew 3:17; 17:5; Mark 1:11; 9:7; Luke 3:22; 9:35; 2 Peter 1:17; 2 Nephi 31:11; 3 Nephi 11:7; 21:20; D&amp;amp;C 93:15; Moses 4:2; JS–H 1:17). Through the condescension of God, that most unlikely prophecy of Isaiah had become reality.<br><br>The unique parentage of Jesus was also announced to Nephi, who was thus instructed by an angel:<br><br><i>Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!</i>[1 Nephi 11:18,21]<br><br>From his mother, Jesus inherited his potential for mortality and death (see Genesis 3:15; Mark 6:3). From his Heavenly Father, Jesus inherited his potential for immortality and eternal life. Prior to his crucifixion, he spoke these words of clarification:<br><br><i>I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</i><br><br><i>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This . . . have I received of my Father.</i>[John 10:17–18]<br><br>Though separate from his Heavenly Father in both body and spirit, Jesus is one with his Father in power and purpose. Their ultimate objective is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Some of you may wonder why the Son is occasionally referred to as "the Father." The designation used for any man can vary. Every man here is a son but may also be called "father," "brother," "uncle," or "grandfather," depending on conversational circumstance. So we must not allow ourselves to become confused regarding divine identity, purpose, or doctrine. Because Jesus was our Creator, he is known in scripture as "the Father of all things" (Mosiah 7:27; see also Mosiah 15:3; 16:15; Helaman 14:12; Ether 3:14). But please remember, "Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of Elohim" (Statement of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles, 30 June 1916; reproduced in James E. Talmage,<i>The Articles of Faith,</i>12th ed. [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924], Appendix 2, p. 473).<br><br>We comprehend that distinction well when we pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost. And as we do so regularly, we honor our heavenly and earthly parentage, just as Jesus honored his as the Son of God.<br><h2><b>Anointed One</b></h2><br>"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power" (Acts 10:38). So Jesus was the Anointed One. The Hebrew word for<i>anointed</i>is<i>Messiah,</i>and the Greek translation is<i>Christ.</i>Thus, "Jesus is spoken of as the Christ and the Messiah, which means he is the one anointed of the Father to be his personal representative in all things pertaining to the salvation of mankind" (Bible Dictionary, s.v. "Anointed One," p. 609). Scriptures declare that Christ is the only name under heaven whereby salvation comes (see 2 Nephi 25:20). So you may add either of these titles to signify your adoration for Jesus--as "the Christ" or as "the Messiah," anointed by God for that supernal responsibility.<br><h2><b>Savior and Redeemer</b></h2><br>Jesus was born to be Savior and Redeemer of all mankind (see Isaiah 49:26; 1 Nephi 10:5). He was the Lamb of God (see 1 Nephi 10:10), who offered himself without spot or blemish (see 1 Peter 1:19) as a sacrifice for the sins of the world (see John 1:29). Later, as the resurrected Lord, he related that sacred responsibility to the meaning of<i>the gospel,</i>which he described in one powerful passage:<br><br><i>Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the gospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i><br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13–14]<br><br>Thus Jesus personally defined<i>the gospel.</i>This term comes from the Old English<i>godspell,</i>which literally means "good news."<br><br><i>The good news is that Jesus Christ has made a perfect atonement for mankind that will redeem all mankind from the grave and reward each individual according to his/her works. This atonement was begun by his appointment in the premortal world but was worked out by Jesus during his mortal sojourn.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "Gospels," p. 682]<br><br>His atonement had been foretold long before Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Prophets had so prophesied his advent for many generations. Since this year's Book of Mormon Symposium's spotlight is focused on the book of Helaman, let us sample from its record, written some thirty years before the Savior's birth:<br><br><i>Remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</i>[Helaman 5:9]<br><br>His atonement blesses each of us in a very personal way. Listen carefully to this explanation from Jesus:<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</i><br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:16–19]<br><br>Jesus fulfilled his glorious promise made in pre–earthly councils by atoning for the fall of Adam and Eve unconditionally and for our sins upon the condition of our repentance.<br><br>His responsibility as Savior and Redeemer was indelibly intertwined with his responsibility as Creator. To shed additional insight on this relationship, I would like to share a remarkable quotation that I found in a rare book in London one day while searching through the library of the British Museum. It was published as a twentieth-century English translation of an ancient Coptic text. It was written by Timothy, Patriarch of Alexandria, who died in A.D. 385. This record refers to the creation of Adam. Premortal Jesus is speaking of his Father:<br><br><i>He . . . made Adam according to Our image and likeness, and He left him lying for forty days and forty nights without putting breath into him. And He heaved sighs over him daily, saying, "If I put breath into this [man], he must suffer many pains." And I said unto My Father, "Put breath into him; I will be an advocate for him." And My Father said unto Me, "If I put breath into him, My beloved Son, Thou wilt be obliged to go down into the world, and to suffer many pains for him before Thou shalt have redeemed him, and made him to come back to his primal state." And I said unto My Father, "Put breath into him; I will be his advocate, and I will go down into the world, and will fulfil Thy command."</i>["Discourse on Abbaton by Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria,"<i>Coptic Martyrdoms Etc. in the Dialect of Upper Egypt,</i>vol. 4 of<i>Coptic Texts,</i>edited, with English translations, by E. A. Wallis Budge (London: British Museum, 1914; New York: AMS Press, 1977), p. 482; brackets appear in printed text. For comparison with related scriptures see Moses 3:7; 6:8–9, 22, 29.]<br><br>Jesus' responsibility as Advocate, Savior, and Redeemer was foredetermined in premortal realms and fulfilled by his atonement (see Job 19:25–26; Matthew 1:21). Your responsibility is to remember, to repent, and to be righteous.<br><h2><b>Judge</b></h2><br>Closely allied to the Lord's status as Savior and Redeemer is his responsibility as Judge. Jesus revealed this interrelationship after he had declared his definition of<i>the gospel,</i>which we just cited:<br><br><i>As I have been lifted up</i>[upon the cross]<i>by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--</i><br><br><i>. . . Therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.</i>[3 Nephi 27:14–15]<br><br>The Book of Mormon sheds further light on how that judgment will occur. So does the temple endowment. When we approach the threshold of the eternal court of justice, we know who will personally preside:<br><br><i>The keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.</i><br><br><i>And whoso knocketh, to him will he open.</i>[2 Nephi 9:41–42]<br><br>Scriptures indicate that the Lord will receive apostolic assistance when exercising judgment upon the house of Israel (see 1 Nephi 12:9; D&amp;amp;C 29:12). Your personal encounter at judgment will be aided by your own "bright recollection" (Alma 11:43) and "perfect remembrance" (Alma 5:18) of your deeds, as well as by the desires of your heart (see D&amp;amp;C 137:9).<br><h2><b>Exemplar</b></h2><br>Another responsibility of the Lord is that of Exemplar. To the people of the Holy Land, he said,<br><br><i>I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done.</i>[John 13:15; see also 14:6; 1 Peter 2:21]<br><br>To the people of ancient America, he again emphasized his mission as Exemplar:<br><br><i>I am the light; I have set an example for you.</i>[3 Nephi 18:16; see also 27:27; 2 Nephi 31:9, 16]<br><br>In his sermon on the mount, Jesus challenged his followers with this admonition:<br><br><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</i>[Matthew 5:48]<br><br>Sinless and flawless as Jesus was in mortality, we should remember that he viewed his own state of physical perfection as being yet in the future (see Luke 13:32). Even he had to endure to the end. Can you and I be expected to do any less?<br><br>When the crucified and resurrected Lord appeared to the people in ancient America, he again stressed the importance of his example. But now he included himself as a perfected personage:<br><br><i>I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect</i>. [3 Nephi 12:48]<br><br>Are you vexed by your own imperfections? For example, have you ever locked your keys inside the car? Or to accomplish a task, have you ever moved from one room to another only to find you have forgotten what you wanted to do? (Incidentally, troubles of that nature don't disappear as you grow older.) Meanwhile, please, do not be discouraged by the Lord's expression of hope for your perfection. You should have faith to know that he would not require development beyond your capacity. Of course you should strive to correct habits or thoughts that are improper. Conquering weakness brings great joy! You can attain a certain degree of perfection in some things in this life. And you can become perfect in keeping various commandments. But the Lord was not necessarily asking for your errorless and perfect behavior in all things. He was pleading for more than that. His hopes are for your full potential to be realized--to become as he is! That includes the perfection of your physical body, when it will be changed to an immortal state that cannot deteriorate or die.<br><br>So while you earnestly strive for continuing improvement in your life here, remember your resurrection, exaltation, and perfection await you in the life to come. That precious promise of perfection could not have been possible without the Lord's atonement and his example.<br><h2><b>Millennial Messiah</b></h2><br>I have chosen to speak last of the Lord's ultimate responsibility, which lies yet in the future. That will be his masterful status as the Millennial Messiah. When that day comes, the physical face of the earth will have been changed:<br><br><i>Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.</i>[Isaiah 40:4]<br><br>Then Jesus will return to the earth. His second coming will be no secret. It will be broadly known.<br><br><i>The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</i>[Isaiah 40:5]<br><br>Then, "the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6). He will govern from two world capitals--one in old Jerusalem (see Zechariah 14:4–7; D&amp;amp;C 45:48–66; 133:19–21) and the other in the New Jerusalem "built upon the American Continent" (Articles of Faith 1:10; see also Ether 13:3–10; D&amp;amp;C 84:2–4). From these centers he will direct the affairs of his church and kingdom. Then he "shall reign for ever and ever" (Revelation 11:15; see also Exodus 15:18; Psalms 146:10; Mosiah 3:5; D&amp;amp;C 76:108).<br><br>In that day he will bear new titles and be surrounded by special Saints. He will be known as "Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that [will be] with him [will be those who] are called, and chosen, and faithful" to their trust here in mortality (Revelation 17:14; see also 19:16).<br><br>He is Jesus the Christ--our Master and more. We have discussed but ten of his many responsibilities: Creator, Jehovah, Advocate with the Father, Immanuel, Son of God, Anointed One, Savior and Redeemer, Judge, Exemplar, and Millennial Messiah.<br><br>As his disciples, you and I bear mighty responsibilities, too. So I now speak in a very personal tone. In my lifetime I have visited all fifty states in the USA. I have also set foot upon the soil of eighty-six other countries of the earth. Wherever I walk, it is my divine calling and sacred privilege to bear fervent testimony of Jesus the Christ. He lives! I love him. Eagerly I follow him, and willingly I offer my life in his service. As his special witness, I solemnly teach of him. I testify of him.<br><br>I also express my deep admiration and affection for each of you, my beloved brothers and sisters, along with my hope and blessing that you will bear your responsibility to know the Lord, love him, follow him, serve him, teach and testify of him, as do I. His church has been restored to the earth in these latter days to prepare the world and its people for his second coming. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1>us Increased in Wisdom and Stature, and in Favour with God and Man” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A little over one month ago, we were all celebrating the glorious Christmas season. We were being filled with the greatest of all messages, that of the birth of our Lord and Savior. Little is written of his life from the time Joseph, Mary, and their wondrous son returned from Egypt until he began his earthly ministry almost thirty years later. Of the two accounts of the birth and early life of the Savior, Matthew lets us know of his return from Egypt to Nazareth, but Matthew's next entry is the account of the baptism by John. Luke does give us one brief account of this early period of his life. Luke records:<br><br><i>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</i>[Luke 2:40]<br><br>Luke also gives us one brief account of one of the family's annual visits to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of the Passover when the Savior was twelve years of age. This story tells that when Mary and Joseph started to return to their home, they discovered that Jesus was not with them, and they returned to Jerusalem to find him. After three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. Luke records that all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. The scripture then records:<br><br><i>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</i>[Luke 2:51–52]<br><br>Using these attributes that described the Savior as he grew to manhood seems to be a good measure for your progress at this special time in your lives.<br><br>When the scriptures record that Jesus increased in stature, he was perfecting his physical body to house his eternal spirit. The physical body is something special to be cared for, watched over, and nourished. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, said this:<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i>[1 Corinthians 3:16–17]<br><br>From the very beginning, the Lord has emphasized the importance of this mortal experience--of having a body and a soul associated together. The Prophet Joseph Smith instructed us in these words:<br><br><i>The first step in salvation of man is the laws of eternal and self-existent principles. Spirits are eternal. At the first organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior chosen and appointed and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it.</i><br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 181]<br><br>Recognizing the privilege of presently having body and spirit associated together, let us examine the other three attributes associated with the Savior's early development. He increased in wisdom. Our heads are the housing of our marvelous brain. There has not been a computer developed that comes close to the input/output and storage capacity centralized within the housing of our heads.<br><br>The ears, the eyes, and the nose, as input devices, can all absorb information totally without a keyboard, optical reader, or any other type of equipment and have it recorded in the almost unlimited storage capacity of our brain. The information so stored can be retrieved almost instantaneously, without a set of complicated directions, as output in the form of speech, facial expression, or movement. Sometimes I wish, however, that the process was a little more complicated when I am in the presence of some who seem to have been built without an "off" switch.<br><br>Every one of us has been blessed with the marvelous instrument that sits on top of our shoulders. How we use our heads is up to each of us to determine. I have a wife who has a temperature comfort zone that has such a narrow limit that if a room temperature is not between 74.75 and 75.25 degrees, she is uncomfortable. I am afraid that many of us have the same narrow focus when we use our heads; we want to limit its use to a narrowly defined comfort zone. We arrive for our university training having lived in a comfort zone without proper preparation for what we want to accomplish with our education. Precious time is wasted in making a decision on the course we should follow.<br><br>After selecting a major, the first time we bump up against a difficult class that is out of our comfort zone, we discard the time, effort, and money expended, change majors and start all over again. We note that a C is a passing grade. Such a grade fits into our comfort zone and will supply us with the same blue and white diploma as the A and B students when we graduate. Thus we miss the thrill of testing our enormous capacities by using the special brains we have been blessed with. The work ethic seems to be a foreign concept to many people. We don't work as hard or as long as we should. Too many in this day and age have bumper stickers on their cars that read, "I'm in no hurry, I'm only on my way to school."<br><br>In these marvelous brains we have, we need to input a basic set of instructions that will keep us on course. It is a set of values or standards that, if followed, will guide us to our ultimate destination.<br><br>There is a great story in the scriptures that illustrates how the Lord feels about having us input these basic instructions into our programs for successful living so we may be able to determine right from wrong. The account is contained in the opening chapters of the Book of Mormon, where it tells of a family who lived comfortably in Jerusalem and needed to get out of their comfort zone in order to grow and progress--in fact, to save their lives. The scripture records:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</i>[1 Nephi 2:2–3]<br><br>So Lehi took his family, leaving their comfortable home, and departed into the wilderness. They had only gone a short distance when the scriptures record:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</i>[1 Nephi 3:2–4 ]<br><br>When Lehi approached his sons with this great responsibility of returning and asking for the record, they thought it was a hard thing he had asked them to do. But Nephi stepped forward and said,<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Thus, the sons of Lehi set out to obtain the scriptures that they might have them to accompany them as they proceeded in the wilderness. They made three efforts to obtain the record. First, they just decided to leave it to chance and cast lots as to who would go to the house of Laban. The lot fell to Laman, and he went to the house of Laban and talked with him. He sat in the house and told him he desired the record contained on the plates of brass. This angered Laban that he would ask such a thing, and he told Laman, "Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee" (1 Nephi 3:13).<br><br>That was enough for Laman. He fled out of Laban's presence and came back sorrowfully to his brethren. Leaving events to chance did not produce the desired result. They were about to return to the wilderness when Nephi had another idea. Rather than going back in failure, why don't we go to our house, the land of our father's inheritance, for there we have much gold and silver and all manner of riches. Let us go and see if we can buy the record from Laban. So they returned to Laban and offered to purchase the record.<br><br>Laban was a worldly man, and seeing all the gold and silver coveted it. Then he looked at these four boys and at all of his servants. He could keep the record and also have the gold and silver. He sent his servants after the boys, and again they had to flee and were obliged to leave their property behind, which fell into the hands of Laban. Things of the world did not produce the record.<br><br>Now when they tried to regroup and think about their responsibility again, it was hard for Nephi to convince his brothers to return the third time. He reasoned with them this way:<br><br><i>Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</i>[1 Nephi 4:1]<br><br>Of course, if they would go by faith, trusting in the Lord, he would deliver the record into their hands if he wanted them to have it. As Nephi obtains the record, he learns a great lesson, for he was instructed:<br><br><i>It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</i><br><br><i>And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</i><br><br><i>And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</i>[1 Nephi 4:13–16]<br><br>Thus, fundamental to this group proceeding into the wilderness was that they have the law of the Lord as a foundation for their growth and development so they would know good from evil, right from wrong, and be able to establish their lives on sound gospel principles.<br><br>The first challenge I leave with you today is to learn to appreciate the power and potential in your heads. Get out of your comfort zone! Expand your vision! Experience the satisfaction that comes from real, earned accomplishment. Use the foundation of the scriptures in your lives to lead, guide, and direct you on the right course.<br><br>Next, the scriptures record that Jesus increased in favour with man. The real joy of living is found when one turns from a life centered in self to one centered in service. James tells us:<br><br><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i>[James 1:27]<br><br>In short, James tells us that true religion is devotion to God, demonstrated by love and compassion for our fellowmen coupled with unworldliness. Such a statement almost seems too simple to be significant, but in its simplicity it speaks an important truth. Restated, it may be said that true religion consists not only in refraining from evil--that is, remaining unspotted--but in deliberately and purposefully doing acts of kindness and service to others.<br><br>King Benjamin recognized this principle. As he spoke to his people from the tower, he reminded them that he had spent his days in their service and said:<br><br><i>I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:16–17]<br><br>The book of Matthew puts it this way:<br><br><i>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:40]<br><br>The life of the Prophet Joseph Smith portrays the same attributes: service to friends, to his fellowmen, to all mankind, and to his God. I have always been impressed in the history of the Church how crisis or hard times seem to bring us closer together and bring about more compassionate service and an extra amount of teamwork. It is too bad that this same spirit of teamwork does not always exist.<br><br>This was demonstrated to me in a most interesting way when I was thrown into a situation upon returning from my mission, and it taught me the real value of teamwork. World War II was raging, and I had just joined the Marine Corps to fulfill my service obligation. As part of our training we had forced marches. Loaded with packs on our backs and rifles over our shoulders, off we would go on a little five-or ten-mile hike over the hot desert terrain of southern California. Following the long columns of Marine platoons would be a Red Cross truck to pick up those who could not make it. To have one of your platoon members picked up by the Red Cross truck was a disgrace worse than anything you could possibly imagine. If one of your number was failing, you would help by carrying his pack or his rifle. If he was still failing, two others would share their packs and rifles with other members willing to carry them along with their own, and they would carry the failing buddy to help him to the end of the hike. The teamwork created was a bonding that was difficult to describe.<br><br>It is exciting to anticipate what would happen here if we could develop that same teamwork, if we could declare that no one in our apartment, no one in our quorum, no one in our Relief Society, or no one in our ward is going to fail while they are here as a student at Brigham Young University, either scholastically, emotionally, physically, or spiritually.<br><br>The second challenge I issue to you today is to develop a heart big enough to show real compassion to all of your fellowmen. Now next: "And Jesus increased in favour with God" (see Luke 2:52). The bowing of the knee has been a symbol of devotion, humility, solemn prayer, and obedience. From the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>And this shall be the sound of his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that are under the earth--for every ear shall hear it, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the trump, saying: Fear God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne, forever and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:104]<br><br>President Kimball has taught us there is a knowledge that our Father in Heaven wants each of us to have, and that is a personal witness that he hears and answers our prayers. He said:<br><br><i>I have always had a very tender feeling about prayer and the power and blessing of prayer. For this I thank our Heavenly Father and my dear parents and teachers, who taught me by word and example about righteous and heartfelt prayer.</i><br><br><i>I am sure that if we pray fervently and righteously, individually and as a family when we arise in the morning, when we retire at night, and around our tables at mealtime, we will not only knit together as loved ones, but we will grow spiritually through communion with our Heavenly Father. Each of us have so much need for his help as we strive to learn gospel truths and live them. We should be seeking his help in the major decisions of our lives, decisions involving schooling, marriage, employment, places of residence, raising our families, serving each other in the work of the Lord, and seeking his forgiveness and continual guidance and protection. Our list of needs is long and real and heartfelt.</i><br><br>I remember while I was in the service a story circulating among the LDS service-men about the courage of a newly inducted serviceman who had just returned from his mission. The first night he was in a large barracks lined with beds of servicemen in bunks, top and bottom. He wanted to kneel down to offer his prayers because that was his practice. He looked at the long rows of beds and wondered if he had the courage to do it. He decided that he needed the protection of the Lord more then than he had at any other time in his life, so he would continue the practice. As the lights went out, he got out of his bunk and knelt in prayer. Soon there was a great uproar. A shoe was tossed at him, among other things. There were remarks ridiculing him for being in that position. Suddenly, the strongest, tallest, and largest man there jumped from his upper bunk into the middle of the barracks. He had been a football player, and muscles bulged from every part of his body. In a loud voice he cried, "The next one who causes any difficulty for this young man praying, I will personally see that he is thrown headfirst through the bulkhead wall."<br><br>Suddenly, everything became quiet, and the young man concluded his prayer. Every night this football player would call down to the returned missionary, "Are you ready for your prayers?" Then the missionary would get out of his bed and onto his knees. The football player would stand in the middle of the aisle so that everyone would be quiet. It wasn't long until the example of this young man was felt by many others in the barracks, and they, too, would kneel and offer their prayers.<br><br>The bowing of the knee is also a sign of obedience to the will of the Lord. Willing, righteous obedience leads to celestial life. Indeed, there is no eternal progress without it. Yet obedience to the commandments of God seems to be one of man's most difficult challenges. Some people do not obey because they feel their free agency is being trampled upon if they consider themselves subservient to Church authority. Others willfully choose an existence of being contrary to the nature of happiness. Still others produce an undisciplined life, persist in their weaknesses, and justify their course of action by struggling and saying, "That's just the way I am."<br><br>You have heard this before, and again I repeat a word of warning to those who are willingly disobedient to the code of honor you agreed to before receiving acceptance to Brigham Young University. I have never sensed in the First Presidency a greater determination to see that the standards are maintained here. The pressures and pleadings of honest, faithful members who want their sons and daughters to come to this university continue in ever-increasing numbers. Thousands will be turned away because the enrollment caps must be met. This only intensifies the need that standards be maintained here as the only fair policy that can or ought to be followed. The few of you who choose to be disobedient should be ready to have your privilege of attending Brigham Young University severed whether you be one week, one month, or years away from completing your educational goals at this university. There are many others waiting to take your place who are willing and anxious to abide by all standards for the privilege of attendance at BYU.<br><br>My third challenge to you is this. Learn the deep satisfaction that comes from communication with God our Eternal Father through humble prayer and experience the great eternal joy that will fill your soul by being obedient to his will. You now find yourselves in the final phase of your major preparation for your life's work. What will your journals record of this period of your mortal experience? Will the statements in your journal be similar to the words contained in the book of Luke regarding the example of the life of our Lord and Savior? Will they indicate that you "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man"?<br><br>God grant that we will have the courage and the discipline to follow the course he has outlined for us, which carries with it the promise of joy in this life and the opportunity of experiencing the blessings of eternal life in the world to come. I bear you my solemn witness that God does live. He stands at the head of this church; it is not man-made. I say this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>elieve: Personal Articles of Belief - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a wonderful thing to meet with university students. You are young and ambitious and bright. You are looking ahead rather than looking back. You are struggling to prepare yourselves to find "a place in the sun."<br><br>Some of you are married, and I hope it is all you dreamed it would be. Others of you, most of you, are looking in the direction of marriage. You are sparring around trying to be attractive to some young man or some young woman, whichever the case may be. You are dreaming of happy and enduring relationships to come--although there is very little time to dream while you work to hold up to the extreme pressure of your studies. Even with that constant pressure, I think everyone of you would say it is a wonderful thing and a wonderful time to be alive and that you would not trade places with anyone else in the world.<br><br>It dawned on me the other day that I was part of a graduating class of a sister institution in 1932. This coming June it will be sixty years ago that we proudly and happily marched in a processional, listened to a commencement address of which I remember absolutely nothing, and went out to face the world.<br><br>That was a dark season, that year of 1932. It was at the bottom of the great worldwide depression. The unemployment rate was not the 5 or 6 or 7 percent over which we worry today, but more than 30 percent. Men saw their savings vanish, and some, with nothing to live for, took their own lives. Many with greater faith held on tenaciously as they sank into the pit of poverty.<br><br>It was into that world of economic distress that we of the class of '32 arrived, breathing something of an air of cynicism. Yet notwithstanding this, there was much joy in our lives. Cars were cheaper then, but few could afford one. But we dated, we danced, we had a lot of fun while worrying about life, and somehow we made it and pulled through. I can think of scores of my peers who had nothing in those days but who, somehow, with the blessings of heaven, went forward and became men and women of strength and substance as they walked a straight and steady course, guided by principles to which they held with steadfastness.<br><br>It was their beliefs and the motivation that came therefrom that pulled them through. Everyone of us is largely the product of his or her beliefs. Our behavior is governed by these. They become our standards of conduct.<br><br>The thirteen articles of faith enunciated by Joseph Smith have stood as an expression of doctrine ever since 1842, when they were written as a concise statement of our theology.<br><br>I have a few personal articles of belief, ten to be exact, that I have tried to observe over the years and which this evening I would like to share with you. I hope you will not think me arrogant or conceited or self-righteous in doing so. I hope you will not think me egotistical. While I speak in a personal vein, I feel the things I mention are of universal application. I have chosen as a title for this talk the title of a small book put out many years ago by Edward R. Murrow,<i>This I Believe.</i>I have shared these thoughts with smaller groups on one or two previous occasions, although not in precisely the same language. And I do not necessarily set these ten statements in order of their importance. Here, then, are my ten articles of belief.<br><br><i>First, I believe in the wonders of the human body and the miracle of the human mind.</i><br><br>I have in my home a reasonably good sound system. I do not use it often, but now and again I sit quietly in the semidarkness and listen for an hour or so to music that has endured through the centuries because of its remarkable qualities. I listened the other evening to Beethoven's concerto for the violin and marveled that such a thing could come of the mind of a man. The composer, I suppose, was very much like the rest of us. I do not know how tall he was or how broad he was or how much he weighed. But I assume that he got hungry, felt pain, and had most of the problems that we all have, and maybe some that we do not have. But out of the genius of that mind came a tremendous blending that created rare and magnificent masterpieces of music.<br><br>Have you ever contemplated the wonder of yourself, the eyes with which you see, the ears with which you hear, the voice with which you speak? No camera ever built can compare with the human eye. No method of communication ever devised can compare with the voice and the ear. No pump ever built will run as long or as efficiently as the human heart. What a remarkable thing each of us is. We can think by day and dream by night. We can speak and hear, smell and feel.<br><br>Look at your finger. The most skillful attempt to reproduce it mechanically has brought only a crude approximation. The next time you use your finger, look at it and sense the wonder of it. While sitting in Symphony Hall in Salt Lake listening to a concert, I was in a position to see the fingers of the performers in the orchestra. Whether playing the strings, the percussion instruments, the brass, the woodwinds--all involved the use of fingers. One does not have to use one's fingers to sing or whistle, but beyond that, there would be little of musical harmony without the deft action of trained fingers.<br><br>I believe the human body to be the creation of divinity. George Gallup once observed, "I could prove God statistically.<i>Take the human body alone--the chance that all the functions of the individual would just happen is a statistical monstrosity"</i>(emphasis added). Our bodies were designed by our Eternal Father to be the tabernacles of our eternal spirits.<br><br>I am grateful for the growing knowledge of how to take care of our bodies. I once read that the smoking of a single cigarette, actuarially speaking, would result in a loss of seven minutes of life for the smoker. I wonder how any thoughtful individual can smoke cigarettes. How can any thoughtful individual take debilitating drugs into his or her system? How can any thoughtful individual expose himself or herself to the deadly scourge of AIDS or to other health problems that follow immorality and abuse of the body?<br><br>I think of the wonders of the age in which we live, this greatest of all ages in the history of mankind. More of invention and scientific discovery has occurred during my lifetime than occurred altogether during all of the previous centuries of the history of man. When I was born in 1910, life expectancy in the United States was about fifty years. Today it is seventy-five. During my brief sojourn on earth there has been added to the average life of a man or woman in the United States, through the wonders of science and associated advances, a quarter of a century of living. This is the remarkable fruition of the efforts of thinking men and women who have applied their inquisitive and dedicated thought processes in the fields of medicine; industrial safety; hygiene and sanitary measures; chemistry in the form of medicines; research in the fields of genetics, microbiology, the environment, and other disciplines, all involving the processes of the human mind.<br><br>What a miracle is the human mind. Think of its power to assimilate knowledge, to analyze and synthesize. You are here at this university to learn.<br><br>What a remarkable thing this is--this process whereby the accumulated knowledge of the centuries has been summarized and filtered so that in a brief period you can learn what was first learned only through long exercises of research and trial and error. Education is the great conversion process through which abstract knowledge becomes useful. It is something that need never stop. No matter how old we grow, we can acquire knowledge and use it. We can gather wisdom and profit from it. We can be entertained through the miracle of reading and exposure to the arts and add to the blessing and fulfillment of living. The older I grow, the more I enjoy the words of thoughtful writers, ancient and modern, and the savoring of that which they have written.<br><br>Under a divinely given mandate, we are to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). And "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). Learning is eternal.<br><br><i>Second, I believe in beauty.</i>The earth in its pristine beauty is an expression of the nature of its Creator. The language of the opening chapter of Genesis intrigues me. It states that "the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" (Genesis 1:2). I suppose it presented anything but a picture of beauty.<br><br>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (Genesis 1:3). And so the Creation continued until "God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Genesis 1:31). I interpret that to mean that it was beautiful, for "out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight" (Genesis 2:9).<br><br>I believe in the beauty of nature--the flowers, the fruit, the sky, the peaks and the plains from which they rise. I see and believe in the beauty of animals. Is there anything more regal than a magnificent horse--its coat brushed and clean, its head held high, its gait a symphony of motion?<br><br>I see and admire beauty in people. I am not so concerned with the look that comes of lotions and creams, of pastes and packs as seen in slick-paper magazines and on television. I am not concerned whether the skin be fair or dark. I have seen beautiful people in a hundred nations through which I have walked. Little children are beautiful everywhere. And so are the aged, whose wrinkled hands and faces speak of struggle and survival.<br><br>May I be personal for a moment? I sat at dinner across the table from my wife the other evening. It was fifty-five years ago that we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. The wondrous aura of young womanhood was upon her. She was beautiful, and I was bewitched. Now, for more than half a century, we have walked together through much of storm as well as sunshine. Today neither of us stands as tall as we once did. As I looked at her across the table, I noted a few wrinkles in her face and hands. But are they less beautiful than before? No, in fact, they are more so. Those wrinkles have a beauty of their own, and inherent in their very presence is something that speaks reassuringly of strength and integrity and a love that runs more deeply and quietly than ever before.<br><br>I believe in beauty--the beauty of God's unspoiled creations, the beauty of his sons and daughters who walk without whimpering, meeting the challenges of each new day.<br><br>I believe in the beauty of good music and art, of pleasing architecture, and of good literature untainted by profanity or verbal filth.<br><br>My dear young friends, there is so much of ugliness in the world in which you live. It is found in the scarred earth, the polluted waters, the befouled air. It is expressed in coarse language, in sloppy dress and manners, in immoral behavior that mocks the beauty of virtue and always leaves a scar. But you can rise above this and revel in the beauty to be found with a little effort.<br><br><i>Third, I believe in the gospel of work.</i>There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor. It is the process by which dreams become realities. It is the process by which idle visions become dynamic achievements.<br><br>Most of us are inherently lazy. We would rather play than work. We would rather loaf than work. A little play and a little loafing are good. But it is work that spells the difference in the life of a man or woman. It is stretching our minds and utilizing the skills of our hands that lift us from mediocrity. It is work that provides the food we eat, the clothing we wear, the homes in which we live. We are accused in America of losing the work ethic. We are accused of losing pride in the quality of our workmanship. That point might be argued for a long time. But we cannot deny the need for work with skilled hands and educated minds if we are to grow and prosper individually and if the nation is to stand tall before the world.<br><br>When Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden, Jehovah declared: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground" (Genesis 3:19).<br><br><i>Fourth, I believe that honesty is still the best policy.</i>What a destructive thing is a little dishonesty. It has become a cankering disease in our society. Every insurance adjustor can tell you of the soaring costs of dishonest claims. Cheating in the payment of taxes robs the treasury of millions and places undue burdens on those who pay. Employee theft, padded expense accounts, and similar things bring tremendous losses to business institutions. The institution may be able to stand the loss of money, but the individual cannot afford the loss of self-respect.<br><br>A year ago the media of a neighboring state made much of the acts of a group of legislators who succumbed to the temptation of a sting operation. Men and women with good reputations evidently ruined their lives and good names over a few paltry dollars that they really did not need and for which they have paid a terrible price.<br><br>A letter and an old ash tray came to the office of the Presiding Bishop the other day. The letter reads: "Dear Sir, I stole the enclosed ash tray from your hotel in 1965. After these many years, I want to apologize to you and ask for your forgiveness for my wrong doing. I have enclosed a check that attempts to reimburse you for the ash tray."<br><br>The check was in the amount of $26.00, one dollar for each year he had kept the ash tray. I can imagine that during those twenty-six years, each time he tapped his cigarette on the rim of that tray he suffered a twinge of conscience. I do not know that the hotel ever missed the ash tray, but the man who took it missed his peace of mind for more than a quarter of a century and finally ended up paying far more for it than it was worth. Yes, my brethren and sisters, honesty<i>is</i>the best policy.<br><br><i>Fifth, I believe in the obligation and blessing of service.</i>I speak of that service which is given without expectation of monetary reward. Most of the troubles of the world come because of human greed. What a therapeutic and wonderful thing it is for a man or woman to set aside all consideration of personal gain and reach out with strength and energy and purpose to help the unfortunate, to improve the community, to clean up the environment, and to beautify our surroundings. How much greater would be the suffering of the homeless and the hungry in our own communities without the service of hundreds of volunteers who give of their time and substance to assist them.<br><br>I have a friend in Seattle, a prominent and highly successful lawyer. When he married, his wife said to him, "Let's resolve to spend one-quarter of our time to improve the community in which we live." Many years have passed now, and that resolution has been kept. Jim Ellis, now a widower, is properly given credit for dynamic and unselfish leadership in one project after another to improve the water and the environment and to build with tremendous foresight public facilities that have blessed the lives of all of the citizens in that great area of our nation.<br><br>Everyone here tonight who has served a mission could testify of the tremendous happiness that comes of service to others. Our Church educational program finds expression not only in Brigham Young University, but on a more far-reaching scale in the seminary and institute system where in some areas of the world a great corps of volunteer teachers carries the instruction load. Last year there were 18,930 dedicated Latter-day Saints so serving who contributed 3,228,104 hours of their time. I talked with one of these the other day, a successful California businessman who gets up at five o'clock, five days a week, to teach seminary. He said, "It's the best thing I ever did." No man can live fully and happily who lives only unto himself.<br><br>Way back in 1625, Arthur Warwick, an English essayist, wrote: "If I cannot give bountifully, yet I will give freely, and what I want (lack) in my hand, I will supply by my heart." And King Benjamin said, "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br><i>Sixth, I believe the family to be the basic and most important unit of society.</i>The greatest joys of life are experienced in happy family relationships. The most poignant of sorrows, the most bleak and forlorn feelings of misery come of unhappy family life.<br><br>We have many failures in America, but the greatest of these, in my judgment, is that failure which is found in broken homes across the nation. Immeasurable is the heartache. The root of most of this is found in selfishness. The cure for most of it can be found in repentance on the part of the offender and forgiveness on the part of the offended.<br><br>Every marriage is subject to occasional stormy weather. But with patience, mutual respect, and a spirit of forbearance, we can weather these storms. Where mistakes have been made, there can be apology, repentance, and forgiveness. But there must be willingness to do so on the part of both parties.<br><br>I believe in the family where there is a husband who regards his companion as his greatest asset and treats her accordingly; where there is a wife who looks upon her husband as her anchor and strength, her comfort and security; where there are children who look to mother and father with respect and gratitude; where there are parents who look upon those children as blessings and find a great and serious and wonderful challenge in their nurture and rearing. The cultivation of such a home requires effort and energy, forgiveness and patience, love and endurance and sacrifice; but it is worth all of these and more.<br><br>To the many of you who are here who dream of finding the right eternal partner, may I say that in my judgment the real essence of happiness in marriage lies not so much in romance as in an anxious concern for the comfort and well-being of one's companion. Thinking of self alone and of the gratification of personal desires will build neither trust, love, nor happiness. Only when there is unselfishness will love, with its concomitant qualities, flourish and blossom.<br><br>Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither exercising dominion over the other but, rather, with each encouraging and assisting the other in whatever responsibilities and aspirations he or she might have.<br><br><i>Seventh, I believe in the principle of thrift.</i>We are witnessing in America tremendous business failures to a degree and an extent we have not seen in a long while. Many of these are the fruits of imprudent borrowing, of debts so large they cannot be paid. We have seen billions upon billions lost in the failure of savings and loan institutions that have been forced to the wall because borrowers did not meet their obligations. We have seen strong banks shaken and brought to their knees because those to whom they loaned money could not pay their debts. The assets of Pan Am Airlines were recently sold. The company could not meet its obligations. Once Pan Am was looked upon as the greatest commercial airline in the world. On more than one occasion I have flown on Pan Am to Tokyo and other great cities of the Orient, to Australia, to India, and around the world to Switzerland and Germany and Britain, to the nations of South America, and to other places where this once mighty monarch was easily the best to be had. It was built by the astute and courageous Juan Tripp. But it lost its sense of service, it borrowed beyond its ability to pay, and, area by area, it has sold its routes and is now dead.<br><br>"American business now devotes 50 percent of its earnings to debt service, double the level 15 years ago" (<i>U.S</i>.<i>News &amp;amp; World Report,</i>15 October 1990). But this problem is not confined to business institutions. It is shared by individuals--such as you and me--in countless numbers in our land. Within a period of one year, consumer nonmortgage debt increased 27 billion dollars. "The typical family now spends 30 percent on debt service, compared with 20 percent a year ago" (<i>U.S. News</i>)<i>.</i>Our pioneer forebears lived by the adage "Fix it up, wear it out. Make it do, or do without." Reasonable debt for the purchase of an affordable home and perhaps for a few other necessary things is acceptable. But from where I sit, I see in a very vivid way the terrible tragedies of many who have gone on a binge of borrowing for things they really do not need.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant once said, "If there is anyone thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart and into the family, it is to live within our means; and if there is anyone thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet."<br><br><i>Eighth, I believe in myself.</i>I do not mean to say this with egotism or arrogance. But I believe in my capacity and in your capacity to do good, to make some contribution to the society of which we are a part, to grow and develop, and to do things that we may now think are impossible.<br><br>I believe that I am a child of God, endowed with a divine birthright. I believe that there is something of divinity within me and within each of you. I believe that we have a godly inheritance and that it is our responsibility, our obligation, and our opportunity to cultivate and nurture the very best of these qualities within us.<br><br>I do not have to be a scrub. Though my work may be menial, though my contribution may be small, I can perform it with dignity and offer it with unselfishness. My talents may not be great, but I can use them to bless the lives of others. I can be one who does his work with pride in that which comes from hand and mind. I can be one who works with respect for associates, for their opinions, for their beliefs, with appreciation for their problems and with a desire to help them should they stumble. I believe in the principle that I can make a difference in this world. It may be ever so small, but it will count for the greater good. The goodness of the world in which we live is the accumulated goodness of many small and seemingly inconsequential acts.<br><br>I think of these great words written long ago by John Donne:<br><br><i>No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</i>[<i>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</i>(1624), no. 17]<br><br>I recall reading something of William Robert Anderson, who commanded a submarine during the Korean War and who later took the submarine<i>Nautilus</i> under the North Pole. He carries in his wallet a dog-eared card on which are written these words:<br><br><i>I believe I am always divinely guided. I believe I will always take the right road. I believe God will always make a way where there is no way.</i><br><br><em>Ninth, I believe in God, my Eternal Father, and in his Beloved Son, the Redeemer of the World.</em><br><br>I believe in the principle of the Golden Rule enunciated by Jesus Christ: "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12). I believe in the principle of the Second Mile of which he spoke in the Sermon on the Mount. Though it is difficult to follow, I believe in that forbearance and forgiveness and charity of which he taught.<br><br>I believe in "the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may" (Articles of Faith 1:11).<br><br>I believe in the sacred writings of the past. Our books of scripture, which have lived through the centuries, set forth the basis of our civil law, of our societal relationships, of our family responsibilities, and, most important, contain the divinely given teachings, principles, and commandments by which to set the course of our lives. They enunciate the relentless law of the harvest: "As ye sow, so shall ye reap" (see D&amp;amp;C 6:33). They spell out a law of accountability under which we must someday give a report of our labors, our activities, and our words to the God of Heaven, who has granted us the privilege of life with all of its joys, with all of its opportunities, and with all of its challenges.<br><br>"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>Not fully, but in a measure at least, I have come to know these, my Father and my Redeemer.<br><br><i>Tenth, I believe in prayer, in the invitation to come unto my Eternal Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>I believe in the integrity of the promise "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him" (James 1:5).<br><br>It was that promise that prompted the boy Joseph Smith to go into the grove, there to kneel in supplication and seek an answer to his question.<br><br>I believe, without reservation, in the reality of the vision he described. From that wellspring of communication between the God of Heaven, the resurrected Redeemer of the World, and a boy, pure in heart and unschooled, has grown this magnificent and wonderful and true Church that is spreading over the earth to bless the lives of all who will hear its message.<br><br>I believe in prayer, that prayer which is the practice of those who have been called to leadership in this Church and which brings forth inspiration and revelation from God for the blessing of his church and people. I believe in prayer, the precious and wonderful privilege given each of us for our individual guidance, comfort, and peace.<br><br>May I say now, in conclusion, that we pray for you, you precious and wonderful and able young men and women. We know that you pray for us. We thank you and we love you and leave our blessing upon you as you walk in virtue and with integrity before the Lord and before one another.<br><br>These then are my ten articles of belief. In so stating them, I have used the first person singular, and this is seldom good. I do so in the spirit of testimony. I have done so only to hold before you these beliefs with the hope that they may find application in your lives. And I do so with respect and appreciation for you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1> How We Treat Each Other - Elaine L. Jack - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is such a pleasure to be with you. I'm especially glad to be here this week because we are celebrating the Relief Society Sesquicentennial. We celebrate 150 years of Relief Society service and sisterhood. That is an accomplishment I'm very proud to share with you.<br><br>Relief Society is glorious because we join as sisters who come unto Christ. In all our roles as sisters, wives, mothers, daughters, friends, roommates, teachers, leaders, and on and on, we strive to come to the Savior. I know how rich our Relief Society sisterhood can be because of what each of us brings to it. Think about how unified we feel and yet how individual we are.<br><br>The women who founded the Relief Society consisted of eleven married women, two widows, six unmarried women, and one whose marital status is unknown. They ranged in age from three teenagers to one woman in her fifties. They were all converts, and some had been converted when they were very young. They lived in different sections of town and in varying economic circumstances. This campus is like that first Relief Society--full of diverse, interesting, faithful women.<br><br>Belle Spafford, a general president of the Relief Society, said, "Relief Society is only on the threshold of its divine mission" (<i>History of Relief Society,</i>1842–1966 [Salt Lake City: General Board of Relief Society, 1966], p. 140). I echo that sentiment. And I add that because of women like you, we shall cross that threshold and bless the world in ways our founding mothers may never have dreamed of. I am confident that as the women of Zion earnestly seek to expand their faith, cultivate deeper hope, and develop and exercise charity, we shall walk past that threshold into a new realm of spiritual awareness and light.<br><br>Brethren, don't think I've forgotten you when I talk about Relief Society. I haven't. As men and women we work together in building the kingdom of God. Just as discussions about priesthood apply to all of us, so do discussions about the principles of Relief Society apply to all. I talk a little about Relief Society today so all of us male and female--might better appreciate the significance of individual spirituality and faith. It is because of faithful men and women that the Relief Society was founded and the Church has flourished.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know how good you are. I know because I observe you closely whenever I'm on campus, and I see many Christlike qualities in your daily interactions with others. I am pleased as I watch you treat each other with kindness and love. I also think on this historic occasion of the Relief Society's 150th year about how many wonderful things will occur in the world because of you.<br><br>Emma Smith, the first general president of the Relief Society, said, "We are going to do something extraordinary. We expect extraordinary occasions and pressing calls" (<i>Minutes of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo,</i>17 March 1842, p. 8). Brothers and sisters, I say that in this day we are going to do something extraordinary. We are going to do something extraordinary because<i>you</i>are extraordinary.<br><br>You may think that is just so much rhetoric. You may say to yourself, "How can Elaine Jack say that? She doesn't know me. She can't predict what I'll do." True, I don't know each of you. But I feel confident you will do many extraordinary things. I know you will, in fact. I know because I watch you, and, therefore, I know a great deal about you. For example, I learned a lot just watching you walk in the Marriott Center today. I learned that over there is a young man who has a lot of friends. He seems to be having a terrific time at the Y. Back farther is a woman who is tired. I think she is having a rough week. I could go on, but you get the point.<br><br>Every time I visit this campus, I look at you and marvel. I think of President Benson's prophetic comments:<br><br><i>All through the ages prophets have looked down through the corridors of time to our day. Billions of the deceased and those yet to be born have their eyes on us. Make no mistake about it--This is a marked generation. There has never been more expected of the faithful in such a short time than there is</i>[of]<i>us.</i>[California Institute Address, February 1986]<br><br>I know many of you have heard such talk for years. It may not yet mean much to you, but it will, for it is true. And because I know all of us alive today are included in the generation of those who must be prepared to meet our God, I often ask myself, "Elaine, how are you doing? How is your faith? What is the quality of your personal preparation?" I'll tell you how I answer those questions. I consider how I treat other people. I look at my own works, and they tell me very quickly the state of my testimony.<br><br>"How do I treat other people?" It is an important question. The Lord taught:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>That scripture explains why I measure my own spiritual progress by asking myself, "How do I treat others?" I said a moment ago that we are only on the threshold of a new era of individual spirituality and faith. I believe we shall cross that threshold in these times. We shall cross it one person at a time. We shall cross it as we individually become more Christlike people.<br><br>In the Relief Society we have a motto: Charity Never Faileth. This is a motto of such spiritual force that I hope every woman in the Church will make it her personal motto. Notice that the scriptures about charity in Moroni 7 and 1 Corinthians don't say, "charity usually never faileth" or, "charity almost always never faileth." They say, "Charity never faileth." Mormon explained:<br><br><i>If ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--</i><br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him</i>[and her]. [Moroni 7:46–47]<br><br>Charity is love--not just earthly love or temporary love, but the pure love of Christ. Charity is so important that we must have it in our lives. It is not just nice to possess charity; it is essential.<br><br>I'm proud to belong to a group of women defined by charity--the Relief Society. The Relief Society was founded to do good in the world, and we're intent on this goal. The lives of charitable women are so imbued with the pure love of our Savior that charity is the way we think and act every day of our lives.<br><br>The Savior explained that when he shall come in his glory,<br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:32–40]<br><br>In rereading that scripture recently, I was struck by the fact that the righteous didn't seem to recognize the Savior in the service they gave to others. I wonder if this was because they had developed the attributes of charity to such a degree in their lives that it was just natural for them to take care of the others around them. They may not have stopped to think, "Oh, I am giving service." They were probably busy living every day of their lives in a way that demonstrated that charity was the foundation of all their actions.<br><br>I would like to be such a person--a woman who naturally blesses others' lives. I know many of you do a lot to bless others' lives. How do I know? Again, from watching how you treat each other.<br><br>Joy is a BYU student from China. Not a member of our faith, Joy is attending law school. She is bright and gifted and is here because she was impressed with the moral standards exhibited by BYU groups that toured China. When she arrived here, she spoke only limited English, so the first year of law school was very difficult.<br><br>An accreditation team visited the law school to investigate the possibility of a one-year course in international law. They felt that the law school was weak in tutoring international students, so they were invited to interview several students from other countries, Joy among them.<br><br>When the team queried her about available tutorial help, she said, "I have so much tutoring help I can't use it all. I know that I could ask anyone of twenty students for help, depending on what I needed."<br><br>The team members asked her about the structure of the tutoring time. She replied, "Students tutor on their own time. I can go to them whenever I need help."<br><br>Thank you, you twenty law students who offered your help to Joy. And thank you, Joy, for adding new dimensions to the lives of those twenty.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, treating each other well should be your highest priority. Paul said,<br><br><i>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</i>[1 Corinthians 13:3]<br><br>To me this means that one-time service projects don't mean much unless I develop the attributes of charity in my life. The Savior said that the "great commandment in the law" is "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind" (Matthew 22:36–37). Charity reflects that pervasive love. When we love the Lord with all our mind, soul, and heart, we will love others. For the Lord added a second commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:39).<br><br>So what is charity? Mormon defined it as "the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47) and as "everlasting love" (Moroni 8:17). He also listed some components of charity:<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i>[Moroni 7:45]<br><br>In one verse of scripture I have a comprehensive list of do's and don'ts on which I can base my treatment of others.<br><br>I want to talk about just two of those points, but, please, ponder the rest of them.<br><br>Have you ever wondered what "charity suffereth long" means? It doesn't mean that charity is a painful process. It is saying that charity is patient. It doesn't give up on others.<i>Suffer</i>means to wait patiently, to tolerate, to hold out, to allow. I do not equate "long-suffering" or "patient" charity with submissiveness to others or lack of energy. Quite the opposite--charity is energetically persistent in reaching its goals. It is submissive only to the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>Sometimes the most important thing we do for others is to suffer long in their behalf. A teaching assistant helps a struggling statistics student, a tutor reviews German verb tenses one more time, a roommate gently requests that the garbage be taken out, a spouse makes another attempt at homemade cherry pie. In these and hundreds of cases we have the opportunity to "suffer long."<br><br>This is the suffering that works understanding. It reminds us that others have been patient with us, that the process of individual growth means we take turns suffering long and being suffered for.<br><br>I often think of my first months as a member of a stake Relief Society presidency in New York City. I was in my twenties and had served only briefly in Relief Society before. The other wise and experienced presidency members were so thorough in walking me through my responsibilities. I still made a lot of mistakes--and was patiently rescued each time. They suffered long.<br><br>Charity is kind. The word<i>kind</i>suggests the simple actions, the tender way of speaking, the gentle touch--all of those effective ways of influencing others that you and I do habitually every day when we have developed a charitable way of thinking.<br><br>Be kind. Even if the blind date is a disaster, be kind. The memories you make now are permanent memories. I still recall how I felt about social experiences in college. I remember which roommates were kind to me. You'll remember, too, so do your best to create good memories for others. Be kind to them.<br><br>I have thought a lot about the kind things that can bring joy into people's lives. My sister brings joy into mine. Even though we each have our own circle of friends, we love being together. I haven't seen her as much as I would have liked this past couple of years, but when I'm crunched she'll look for a blouse I need or leave some soup and bread at the back door when I've been away. Those little things seem like big things to me. I think of them as fine acts of charity.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, our small acts of charitable service give others opportunities to receive. Usually we think of the bishop as the one who dispenses the comfort and advice needed in a ward to his family and to others. But when death took the son of her bishop and his wife, JoAnne spent countless hours talking with the grieving mother. JoAnne demonstrated a real ability to rely on the Spirit as she attempted to help. Her Ph.D. study is in death and grieving, so she knew how to help from a clinical as well as a sisterly perspective. JoAnne's skill and spiritual sensitivity blessed a whole family. The mother told others in the ward that JoAnne often answered her prayers through an unexpected phone call or visit.<br><br>When I heard the story, I felt good that the bishop and his wife let JoAnne have this opportunity to give as a way of expressing her love and sympathy. This was that family's season to be the receivers and JoAnne's time to be the giver.<br><br>To develop this ability of truly helping others takes practice and the desire to learn. Fortunately, the Lord has taught us ways we can develop the attributes of charity. Let me share several of them with you.<br><br>Personal prayer: This calling to be Relief Society general president has driven me to my knees very often. I so earnestly desire the well-being of all of our sisters, and of you brethren as well. I care about the welfare of each BYU student. One of the greatest blessings that has come into my life is this opportunity to pray for so many others. I feel as the Psalmist said, "Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray" (Psalms 55:17). I learn more about love as I pray for others. I also learn that while the Lord will hear my prayers, he will answer them in his time and in his way. But he is always there.<br><br>Several years ago my good friend Carol led a tour group to the then Soviet Union. This was just as Gorbachev was coming to power and "perestroika" was only being introduced into our Western vocabularies. When this tour group was attempting to leave the Soviet Union, the border guards decided their visas were insufficient. My friend and her group were forced off a train at the border of the Soviet Union and Hungary at 4:00 a.m. with no access to a telephone, fax machine, or telegraph, let alone a hotel. Carol said that as she watched the border guards literally throw their luggage from the train windows, she thought, "It is a good thing I already know the Lord answers prayers because now would be a poor time to question it." Carol prayed that the Lord would bless her to respond kindly to those who had put her in this hard spot. She prayed that the Lord would bless others to be kind to her group as well. The Lord did bless them, and there was a happy ending to that adventure.<br><br>Scripture study: One of the best parts of scripture study for me is that various passages increase in personal meaning as I have new experiences. One such passage reads: "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a [woman], I put away childish things" (1 Corinthians 13:11).<br><br>When I was a young college student living far from my family, I did not understand the peace and direction that I now know can come from the scriptures. I am sorry that part of my life passed without this knowledge. I could have gotten more comfort and insight than I did. When I was a young mother, I used the scriptures more to help my sons grow in their gospel understanding. Now I am exhilarated by the truths I learn in the scriptures.<br><br>A year ago a college student told me how foolish she felt giving a spiritual message to the women she visit teaches. "They're my friends," she explained. "We don't talk about things like that, and we see each other at church anyway, so I just feel silly giving them a spiritual message." I have felt sad all year about her comments. It hurts me that this woman has closed herself off from the means of building some of the deepest and most meaningful friendships she could ever know.<br><br>Sharing the gospel with others is one of the richest blessings of my life. Through scriptural discussions I've learned a great deal about charity by hearing other people's insights.<br><br>Some of my favorite passages in the scriptures are verses I've discussed with my friend Carolyn Rasmus. Whenever Carolyn and I talked about a scripture, I put her initials by it so I could remember better what we discussed. Carolyn has deepened my insights into scriptures that I've read many times but never thought of in the ways she has. I've loved these moments shared with her.<br><br>One of my general board members recently told me about a friendship she has developed as a result of sharing the scriptures. She and an associate had a long drive together. The associate, who was driving, asked if my friend would read some passages of the Book of Mormon to her. They started in Mosiah. Soon they were discussing their testimonies as they shared sections of Ether and Moroni. My friend learned from the way her traveling companion had marked the scriptures. They both learned about each other, and they felt the spirit of the Lord. A friendship blossomed from that spiritual sharing that would never have unfolded otherwise.<br><br>I hope sharing the scriptures and your testimony with others is an important part of your life. If you haven't added the scriptural dimension to your friendships yet, try it, you'll like it.<br><br>These words of Nephi are significant to me:<br><br><i>And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i>[2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>My friends, as part of your daily comings and goings, I pray that you will feel it in your heart to echo Nephi--to talk of, rejoice in, and preach of Christ. Nothing can teach you charity faster.<br><br>In addition to personal prayer and scripture study, the Lord has taught us to freely give. He taught, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). The Lord wants us to do what we can--and do it lovingly. I know that many of you at BYU follow the Savior's teachings--you freely give. Marilyn Arnold shared a story of some BYU students who freely gave much needed help. Her elderly parents were out walking one evening when her father fell and seriously cut his arms. Some students were walking by and saw him go down. They immediately came to his aid, saw that he got medical attention, and made sure that both her parents were taken care of. They subsequently called at their home several times to see how her father was recovering.<br><br>What the Lord teaches us is that each of us should do what is ours to do. I asked Jason Hall to tell me of acts of charity he has experienced on campus. He said,<br><br><i>The greatest acts of charity I've experienced are little acts, the kind words and kind deeds. I remember one time I was sitting in front of a big group, waiting to give a talk. I was very scared, and my tie was a little crooked. The girl I brought with me came and straightened my tie, looked at me, and said, "I think you're great." I remember the impact that had on me; the nerves were gone because I knew that someone thought I was okay. Due to the kind word of a friend, my entire attitude had changed. For me, that is</i>w<i>hat charity is all about.</i><br><br>Jason's friend did what was hers to do. And, brothers and sisters, that is what the Lord asks of each of us.<br><br>I like the story of Janice. She is majoring in engineering, and to keep herself in school works summers in a hard hat and boots in an oil field in Long Beach, California. Last year she spent the bulk of her afternoons and evenings helping young mothers in her ward. One of these women reported that Janice spent over twenty hours helping her sort, clean, and rearrange furniture for the new baby. She did volunteer baby-sitting for other ward members. When these young mothers compared notes, they discovered that Janice had helped all of them during the few weeks she was home that summer.<br><br>When we are willing, the Lord can use us as the means of blessing each other. I am always grateful when someone reaches a hand out to me or to one of my family. I am always grateful when I can give my hand to someone who may need me.<br><br>A lot of women speak to me about how lonely they are. Some of them attend this university. I generally suggest that they think about how many hands they have held in the last week. I don't presume that going from person to person in the spirit of service conquers all of our problems. But I know from my own experience that doing for others often puts life in a clearer perspective. It reminds us that our individual circumstances are not the only set of circumstances in the whole world or even in the dorm. Reaching out to someone else can help us shake loose some of our own inwardness. It can let us be part of the solution to problems, rather than the creation of them.<br><br>Allison is a very popular track star and communications major. One night she and her friend Becky were heading for a group date. Allison stopped at the bottom of the stairs, asked Becky to wait a moment, and then ran back to the apartment. She returned with a blanket, which she quietly slipped around a homeless man standing on the street corner. What a nice example of following the Lord's direction that we freely give.<br><br>Here is another good charitable habit. Phone home. Especially call your mother. Parents need your nurturing and support, just as you need theirs. Even if your relationship isn't the best, call your mother and father.<br><br>Say "thank you" often. When a professor writes a comprehensive comment on your paper, say "thank you." When a roommate teaches your Sunday School lesson, say "thank you." When a spouse cleans the apartment, say "thank you." When a home teacher brings you cookies, say "thank you." When a visiting teacher repairs your leaking toilet, say "thank you." When a neighbor takes your child, say "thank you." When a friend mails you a letter, say "thank you." When a grocery store clerk is helpful, say "thank you." The Lord has told us to be a thankful people. One way we do that is by acknowledging the kindnesses--large and small--that others show us.<br><br>Another charitable habit: Lighten up and chill out. Take a healthy helping of enjoyment and laughter from the smorgasbord of life's experiences. And give some to your neighbors and friends. While we don't choose all that lands on our plates, we may choose some of the trimmings. Laughter is a condiment that makes just about anything go down better. And the ability to enjoy life with all its frustrations and diversity is like a good sorbet--it freshens the palate. Good humor refreshes me as nothing else can. Sharing a good laugh with someone is often an act of charity.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I salute you for the many small charitable acts you do that mean so much to others. I hope this Relief Society sesquicentennial year will be the time when you decide your life will be something extraordinary. I pray you will follow Mormon's counsel about charity:<br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren</i>[and sisters],<i>pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons</i>[and daughters]<i>of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.</i>[Moroni 7:48]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine L. Jack was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 March 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ng Is as Precious in His Sight as the Other” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. I am grateful for the honor of addressing you in this capacity. I'm sorry that President Lee couldn't be here. He called yesterday to express his disappointment. I think he wouldn't mind if I started with the story that I had planned to. He has such a wonderful sense of humor. I selected a story that would be fitting for a devotional because it has a religious theme. I'll just change one of the main characters.<br><br>These two fellows died and went to heaven. When they reached the pearly gates, Saint Peter greeted them and said, "Come with me. I'll show you where you are going to live."<br><br>The first man he took to what appeared to be a tiny hut. The other he escorted to a gorgeous mansion. It was beautiful--gold trim, the works! An onlooker said, "Saint Peter, I do not mean to tell you your business, but wasn't that the Pope you took over to that hut? And wasn't that Provost Bruce Hafen you took to that mansion?"<br><br>"Well, yes," said Saint Peter, "but don't fret. Everything is just as it should be. You see, we have a number of popes here, but this is our very first lawyer!"<br><br>Isn't it pretty silly to think that this story would depict how it is? But, as evident in the world today, we mortals can easily be fooled. Seeking identity from the world brings trouble--it is a mirage. Seeking identity from the Lord brings truth--it is real.<br><br>I am grateful to be a part of the BYU community, a university in which the whole of what we do can be grounded in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I love President Benson and testify that he is a living prophet of God. It is marvelous to have the privilege of being associated with a university that is guided by living prophets. What a thrill it is for me to be here. At other universities I have been able to teach similar principles but never to identify the source. So to be free to do that here is just as if the lid has been taken off. It is a marvelous experience and opportunity.<br><br>Today I pray that the Spirit will be with us in abundance. I am thankful for the assistance I have received in preparing this talk. I am thankful for loving friends who are here today and am grateful for your prayers.<br><br>In January 1992 President Rex E. Lee delivered his winter devotional address, which he entitled "Things That Change, and Things That Don't." I was elated to hear this distinguished university president testify of the reality of absolute truth. In his talk he declared, "Throughout your lives, you will come across some people who will assure you with great solemnity that there is no such thing as an absolute. In these people's view, everything is relative. . . . Most of those people are very sincere. And all of them are dead wrong" (<i>BYU 1991–92 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1992], p. 54).<br><br>I enthusiastically add my testimony of absolutes to that of President Lee's. Absolute truth is that which is eternal--its source is beyond this world. It comes to us from God. We can respond to that truth, we can embrace it and be devoted to it, but it is not of our own making.<br><br>The main thrust of my talk today is basing self-acceptance on absolute, eternal values as opposed to the usual practice of basing self-acceptance on competence, achievements, appearance, or, in other words, the things of the world. Incorporating these eternal verities into our lives is essential to our progress and to living the first and second great commandments. Unless we base our acceptance of self and others on these absolute truths, we are not able to see ourselves as the Lord sees us, "as we really are." In the Book of Mormon, Jacob chastised his well-to-do brethren for persecuting those who were of lesser means. He admonished them for the pride in their hearts, for thinking they were better than others because of the costliness of their apparel and because of their advantaged position and riches.<br><br><i>Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</i>[Jacob 2:21]<br><br><i>And he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.</i>[2 Nephi 26:33]<br><br>I know that every person is precious in the sight of God. At the conclusion of an address to religious educators that he gave last February, Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke of the importance of knowing how God sees us: "I hope you will help your students feel their relationship to God, feel his concern for them, and feel his love for them" ("Sins, Crimes, and Atonement," CES address, Temple Square Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City, Utah, 7 February 1992, p. 8).<br><br>Why do I feel so strongly that it is imperative that we know the Savior's love for us and have reverence for our own lives? It is such a waste of a beautiful life when any person feels that he or she is no good. I know. I have lived on both sides of this issue. For more than half of my life, I did not like who I was. It was dark, lonely. On the surface everything seemed great, but inwardly I feared that if anyone really knew me, they wouldn't like me. The confusing thing to me was, with all the accomplishments I was racking up, I still did not have a good sense of self.<br><br>Heavenly Father tells me in my patriarchal blessing that he loves me. I read those words for ten years, and they never sank in. By the time I was thirty-two, I was desperate to know if I was loved. This disparity between the "outside" me and the "inside" me came to be more than I could stand, and in a most earnest prayer I pleaded with Heavenly Father to know if he loved me. The answer was one I could not doubt or deny. Luckily, it was affirmative! Then I couldn't reconcile this knowledge of being loved with how I felt about myself. If I don't love myself I am telling Father he is wrong, or that he has bad taste! It took nearly six months of prayer, repenting, and pretending that I loved myself before I could come to genuinely be glad to be me. Then my whole life changed.<br><br>What an incredible difference to be able to honestly thank the Lord for who you are, to be grateful and happy to be you instead of disliking yourself or feeling pressure to be more than you are. Because of the world we live in today, everyone has to overcome the influences that seem to tear us down or falsely build us up. I can tell you with feeling that real acceptance of self does not come through worldly accomplishments or acceptance by others. Of course these things feel good and can be exciting and positive aspects of life. But thinking that acceptance of self comes from succeeding in the world is a very effective ploy of the adversary. Love for self; a deep, abiding peace; and knowing who you really are come from only one source--from God. Knowing you are loved and knowing true peace are invaluable. Anything else in the world pales by comparison. Knowing that Heavenly Father truly loves us and trusting that it is vital to Heavenly Father that we come home to him are some of the greatest motivators that we can have to give us the genuine desire to be true to him. With reverence for self based on God's love, we will reject the temptations that otherwise would draw us to the pride of the world. We would love nothing more than God.<br><br>You can imagine how excited I was to hear the words of President Benson in his classic address "Beware of Pride" in April 1989 general conference. "The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. Their self-esteem is determined by where they are judged to be on the ladders of worldly success." Then President Benson described how we come to have a valid, true sense of self: "If we love God, do His will, and fear His judgment more than men's, we will have self-esteem" (<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, p. 6).<br><br>Acceptance for self that is generated by the world is fake. By virtue of its very nature, "other-directed self-esteem" will constantly vacillate, alternating highs and lows. It has to, because it is not possible to always succeed. Therefore, if acceptance is based on success, then lack of success must mean lack of acceptance. How could that be right? If that were so, instead of learning from our mistakes, every difficulty would cause us to think less of ourselves.<br><br>"You can never get enough of what you don't need, because what you don't need never satisfies," said Mary Ellen Edmunds in the Relief Society sesquicentennial broadcast ("A World of Experience,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, p. 97). Worldly self-esteem is never satisfied; you achieve or acquire more and more but still feel empty inside. Without charity, the pure love of Christ, we are nothing (see Moroni 7:46–47). Acceptance of self based on God's love is real. This true reverence for self is deep, filled with gratitude and peace, and is ever-present even in the face of life's most difficult trials. As each person is as precious in his sight as the other, each one has ready access to honest, lasting, real self-acceptance.<br><br>A very practical blessing of the restored gospel is that we know the absolute truths that provide the foundation for having a good sense of self. Once self-acceptance is based on this sure, absolute foundation, then you will be free to aspire, achieve, excel. Then you will be giving of yourself out of gratitude to the Lord, to serve the Lord, to magnify your talents, to do his work. You will not be out there on your own agenda, killing yourself to be somebody, to measure up to someone else's expectations, and obsessed with the need to be accepted. Your whole motive will arise from your love for him, your trust in his love for you, your desire to do his will.<br><br>So what is the formula? What are the absolutes, the "things that don't change" that are the basis for a genuine, real, stable, secure self?<br><br><i>1. We are literal spirit children of heavenly parents.</i>In a statement of the First Presidency under Joseph F. Smith, we are told that we are "offspring of celestial parentage" and that "all men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother, and are literally the sons and daughters of Deity" ("The Origin of Man,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1909, pp. 75–81). Elder Packer testified in April 1992 conference,<br><br><i>No greater ideal has been revealed than the supernal truth that we are the children of God, and we differ, by virtue of our creation, from all other living things. (See Moses 6:8–10, 22, 59.</i>)<br><br><i>No idea has been more</i>destructive<i>of happiness, no philosophy has produced more sorrow, more heartbreak and mischief; no idea has done more to destroy the family than the idea that we are not the offspring of God.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "Our Moral Environment,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, p. 67; emphasis in original]<br><br>Obviously, some people do not have a clue as to their divine nature, and others seem to have a glimpse of this noble birthright. How would each of our lives be different if our divine nature were the primary factor on which we based our identity? When asked who you are, what comes to mind?<br><br><i>2. We are soul, body and spirit, and every soul will be resurrected.</i>Why is this absolute truth important as we strive to see ourselves as the Lord sees us? According to self-esteem studies, in the way the world views us, the number-one factor in determining whether we have self-esteem or not is appearance. A student in our Philosophy of Body, Mind, Spirit course this past semester wrote of how angry she was upon realizing that she had been victimized into thinking she was not attractive. Dieting, eating disorders, disparaging attitudes, and other destructive behaviors are rampant as we are driven toward an obsession with "the outward appearance." "For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (l Samuel 16:7). Laurie concluded her final paper with these thoughts:<br><br><i>I believe that because we are refusing to take responsibility for our bodies, falsifying our outside image, which cannot but serve to canker our souls, we are ultimately forfeiting the right to become like God. . . . We must make from our physical selves a being fit to be a god, and never, never despise that which sets us apart from the hosts of Satan--our bodies, however flawed, however imperfect. If we reverence our body and spirit, as does the Lord, we cannot be false to ourselves! The face that we fashion will be the one that God has given. And so, I would ask, Have you received his image in your countenance?</i>[Laurie Harris, "His Image in Our Countenance," final paper, winter 1992, p. 6; paper in possession of speaker]<br><br>Why would we not have reverence for our body as a glorious aspect of our divine self? "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22). "The spirit and the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15). By nature we are more like God now than we were in the premortal existence. The body is a primary blessing in our process of moving forward. Immune research of the past several decades gives astounding proof as to the totally interactive functioning of the emotions, mind, and body. We are soul by definition, and we function and live as soul. If we think of our body as negative, something the spirit needs to dominate, or something we would rather do without, we put ourselves in a state of contention. And we know that contention is of the devil and not of the Lord (3 Nephi 11:29). The Lord said, "Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). I think that sentiment is wonderfully applicable to our own soul as well as to our relations with others. As we have reverence for our bodies, our whole soul, we will be motivated to completely value ourselves and be gentle with ourselves. Are you grateful for your body as well as for your spirit?<br><br>Mickey Trockel told a story in class that illustrated the "victimization" of letting another person define us. A naturalist who saw an eagle in a chicken coop questioned the farmer as to why this eagle was in with the chickens? The farmer replied that the eagle was now a chicken. He had taught him to be a chicken and to peck corn along with all the other chickens. Thinking this was ridiculous, the naturalist took the eagle up a ladder and told it to spread its wings and flyaway. The eagle jumped down into the coop and pecked corn with the other chickens.<br><br>The naturalist was not to be discouraged. He took the eagle up to the top of the barn and told it to spread its wings and fly away, but the same thing happened again. "This just cannot be," thought the naturalist. He asked the farmer if he might take him to a high cliff and try again.<br><br>The farmer laughed, "You can try anything, but I tell you, the eagle has learned that it is a chicken."<br><br>The naturalist took the eagle high on a cliff and told it to spread its wings and fly away. The eagle looked to the sun, then spread its wings and soared over the valley. We can let others victimize us, even try to define us, but only when we look to the Son, the Son of God, Jesus Christ, will we know and appreciate ourselves as we really are.<br><br><i>3. Each person, each soul, is of infinite and eternal worth and value.</i>The Lord explicitly assures us of our worth and value to him.<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;</i><br><br><i>For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10–11]<br><br>Jesus did not wait to see how we would live before he gave his life for us. The truth is that the worth of each unique life is divine, infinite, and cannot be taken away. The worth of the soul means worth of the whole soul, the whole person--spirit and body. Our worth cannot be manipulated by others, it cannot be increased or decreased. I jumped for joy upon discovering the following statements in Elder Maxwell's marvelous book<i>Men and Women of Christ.</i>Talking about knowing our true identity, he said: "This is one of the great but underappreciated blessings of the restored gospel. It richly assures us of our intrinsic value and of our eternal and ultimate worth" (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991, p. 128).<br><br>Because worth is an absolute aspect of life, it will always exist. Of course, it is difficult to realize our worth to God if we are not living his commandments. Elder Maxwell also said, "There is more individuality in those who are more holy. Sin, on the other hand, brings sameness; it shrinks us to addictive appetites and insubordinate impulses" ("Repentance,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 30). A person may lose sight of his or her worth, but that person's worth is always great in the sight of God. A human life is always of utmost worth because that worth is eternal and cannot be erased. Isn't it great to know? Worthless is not an option.<br><br><i>4. The influence of the Holy Ghost always produces joy and satisfaction.</i>Long ago George Q. Cannon gave this advice:<br><br><i>I will tell you a rule by which you may know the Spirit of God from the spirit of evil. The Spirit of God always produces joy and satisfaction of mind. When you have that Spirit you are happy; when you have another spirit you are not happy. The spirit of doubt is the spirit of the evil one; it produces uneasiness and other feelings that interfere with happiness and peace.</i>[<i>JD</i>15:375]<br><br>President Benson said, "Most of us consider pride to be a sin of those on the top, such as the rich and the learned, looking down at the rest of us. (See 2 Nephi 9:42.) There is, however, a far more common ailment among us--and that is pride from the bottom looking up" ("Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, p. 5). This means that thinking negatively about ourselves is a form of pride. The natural man is an enemy to God, and therefore full of pride. Putting off the natural man, in part, means putting off attitudes of self-deprecation, to stop putting ourselves down. I once heard integrity defined as not thinking or saying negative things about ourselves.<br><br>How dependent are we on others for approval or worldly recognition to feel happiness? Here is a marvelous statement from the School Sayings of Confucius: "The orchid that grows in the deep gorges does not withhold its fragrance because of lack of appreciation. The wise person strives for establishment of virtue and maintenance of principles. He does not alter his integrity because of poverty and distress."<br><br>If we do not fear people's judgment but instead yield to the enticing of the Spirit, we will find that the Holy Ghost does fill us with love and joy. Why do we look elsewhere for happiness?<br><br><i>5. Each person, each soul, is always loved.</i>John the Beloved taught us that God is love. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). "We love him, because he first loved us" (l John 4:19). "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us" (l John 4:10).<br><br>We do not initiate love. It is another absolute. It is already there. It is always there. How do we relate to God's love? We receive it, respond to it, are grateful for it--we love it! As Dennis Rasmussen has written in his provocative, insightful book,<i>The Lord's Question: Thoughts on the Life of Response</i>(Provo: Keter Foundation, 1985):<br><br><i>Only by responding do I learn to be responsible; only by responding do I learn to care about something beyond myself.</i>[p. 4]<br><br>[The]<i>response of obedience is the free response of love.</i>[p. 7]<br><br><i>Deep in every human heart is the desire to be known and loved just for oneself.</i>[p. 9]<br><br><i>God knows that self already. To guide but not to compel man toward his own true self, God asks his question. As man responds with love, he becomes the self that God knows and wants him to be.</i>[p. 8]<br><br>Scott Giles, of BYU football fame, gave permission for us to share his perspective:<br><br><i>As a youngster, before one particular game, I turned to my mom and asked, "Mom, will you love me even if we lose and I don't play very well?"</i><br><br><i>"Scott, I love you no matter what happens. If you win or lose I love you all the same."</i><br><br><i>This brought peace to my heart and took the added pressure off of my shoulders. I knew then that my mother's love was not based on the things I did but she loved me because of who I am. In my life I have seen that many people wanted to be with me because of my successes with football, but their friendship and attitudes changed depending on how successful or unsuccessful I was. While serving an LDS mission I learned that Heavenly Father loves all of his children. He looks upon the heart and soul. He does not weigh a person's worth by the way they dress or the things they have accomplished or attained. His love is an intrinsic part of the gift of life. Sometimes I do not achieve that which I wanted to accomplish or do the things that I should do, but I like myself. I like who and what I am. I am thankful for a Heavenly Father that loves me. He allows me to learn from my own choices but still loves and values the things that are truly me.</i><br><br>This is an especially moving account because I believe that the more talented you are, the more beautiful, the more money, etc., the more difficult it is to realize that you are loved by Heavenly Father. Picture the mist of darkness in Lehi's dream that kept the people from finding and partaking of the fruit of the tree. Recognition and fame may cloud the true source of love.<br><br>Also, looking to the Savior for love does not minimize excellence--just the opposite happens. When you know you are loved for yourself, you can learn from your mistakes rather than having your ego destroyed. Without the fear of failure, or fear that you do not measure up, you are free to excel--not compelled, but free to give, to offer your best. Life becomes a process of giving rather than compulsive getting. Love and respect flow from Father through us to others.<br><br>I am greatly troubled when I read or hear that people think that God's love is conditional, something we need to earn. This so diminishes the omniscience of our Savior, our Redeemer. I had this humorous image while contemplating the folly of thinking that God's love was conditional. There were these two angels that were assigned to help God. One was the "thumbs-up" angel and the other the "thumbs-down" angel. These angels were assigned to observe the behaviors and attitudes of humans and then report them to God. The thumbs-up angel would make a list of the names of those people "who did good" that day. The thumbs-down angel would make a list of names of those people who didn't do so well for various reasons like "I hate myself," "I gained ten pounds," "Oh, that commandment is so hard to live," "How can I ever be seen in public with this hair?" Each angel would complete his list and deliver the list to God and then say, "These are the people you are not supposed to like today. These are the ones you<i>can</i>like today!"<br><br>Isn't this image silly? If that was the way God's love really worked, he surely would be kept busy by the lawyers!<br><br>God's love is unfeigned. His love is always perfect, always genuine. It certainly is not prone to manipulation. How absurd to think that we fashion God's love by our actions! As Trevor R. McKee has explained in his writing, "Feigned love seeks recognition and praise. Unfeigned love is charity" ("Love Unconditional or Love Unfeigned: Justice and Mercy in Human Development,"<i>AMCAP Journal,</i>vol. 12, no. 2, 1986, p. 56).<br><br>If God's love was conditional, it would cease to be a gift. If the process were that of earning love, then the one earning the love would get the credit. Logic tells us that this process is pride. We know that we are loved by way of the Holy Spirit. If we choose not to live by the Spirit, but choose to live as the natural man, the less likely we are to want God's love or to receive God's love.<br><br><i>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:33]<br><br>When we receive the gift, when we yield to the enticing of the Spirit, we are filled with love. Filled with his love, we love God, we lose our desire to do evil, and, more than anything, we want to be like him and be with him. Once we are filled with his love, we cannot help but stand in awe of his love for us and be grateful for who we are. When we realize that each and every person is loved by Heavenly Father, it prompts us to love each and every person, too.<br><br>Do you know you are loved? It is my most fervent prayer that you do know you are loved.<br><br><i>6. We are totally dependent on Jesus for eternal life.</i>There is free lunch (see Hugh Nibley, "Work We Must, but the Lunch Is Free" in<i>Approaching Zion</i>[Salt Lake City and Provo: Deseret Book Co. and Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1989], pp. 202–51). In the October 1990 general conference, President Hunter discussed the meaning of taking the Savior's yoke upon us.<br><br><i>Why face life's burdens alone, Christ asks, or why face them with temporal support that will quickly falter? To the heavy laden it is Christ's yoke, it is the power and peace of standing side by side with a God that will provide the support, balance, and the strength to meet our challenges and endure our tasks here in the hardpan field of mortality.</i>["Come unto Me,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1990, p. 18]<br><br>The whole of what is real is based in the Savior. We are completely dependent on him. The Lord will provide. We can give to the world and not expect or need anything back. Our real work is his work; our real effort is simply to love him and do his will. He is the one who will change our hearts; he is the one who will refine us. We do not need to be macho about life. We not only do not need to progress on our own--we surely cannot do it without him.<br><br>Elder Oaks teaches:<br><br><i>If justice is balance, then mercy is counterbalance. if justice is exactly what one deserves, then mercy is more benefit than one deserves. In its relationship to justice and mercy, the Atonement is the means by which justice is served and mercy is extended. We are all dependent upon the mercy God the Father extended to all mankind through the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This is the central reality of the gospel. This is why we "talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ.</i>. . ,<i>that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins"</i>(2<i>Nephi 25:26). The reality of our total dependence upon Jesus Christ for the attainment of our goals of immortality and eternal life should dominate every teaching and every testimony and every action of every soul touched by the light of the restored gospel. If we teach every other subject and principle with perfection and fall short on this one, we have failed in our most important mission.</i>["Sins, Crimes, and Atonement," pp. 2–3]<br><br>According to Elder Maxwell, "Too often we behave as if we were in massive competition with others for God's love. But we have His love, unconditionally and universally; it is our love of Him that remains to be proven" (<i>Even As I Am</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1982], p. 63). The Lord showed to Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth. Enoch marveled at the incredible creation before him while Jehovah, himself, wept. And Enoch, puzzled by this, asked, "How is it thou canst weep?"<br><br><i>The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;</i><br><br><i>And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood.</i>[Moses 7:31–33]<br><br>What we think of ourselves is of great concern to the Lord. He implores us to not hate ourselves and others. Can we even begin to fathom the love he has for us? His work and his glory is to have us come home to him. We are the focus of his existence. If we will trust in his love, receive it into our lives, we will want to walk with him always, live his commandments, and do his will. We will not want anything to come between ourselves and our Savior. In his faith-building talk "Believing Christ: A Practical Approach to the Atonement," Stephen E. Robinson assured us that the Lord is capable of doing his work. We have no need to fear; he can save us from our sins, from our weaknesses, inadequacies, and whatever else we feel we lack. It is one thing to believe in Christ but another to believe Christ. Listen to Brother Robinson's description:<br><br><i>Many of us are trying to save ourselves, holding the Atonement of Jesus Christ at arm's distance and saying, "When I've done it, when I've perfected myself. . . , then I'll be worthy of the Atonement . . . ."</i>[But]<i>that's like saying, "When I am well, I'll take the medicine. I'll be worthy of it then."</i>[<i>BYU 1989–90 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1990), p. 124]<br><br>In another inspiring talk recently given on this campus, "The Only Sure Foundation: Building on the Rock of Our Redeemer," Robert L. Millet testified,<br><br><i>Sometimes we tend to focus so much upon the fact that Jesus Christ died for us that we do not attend to an equally important facet of his redemptive enterprise--the fact that he came to live in us. As we come to gain that life which is in Christ--a life which comes as we seek for and cultivate the Spirit of the Lord--we receive that enabling power which extends to us the strength to forsake and overcome, a power which we could not have generated on our own.</i>[Seventh Annual Book of Mormon Symposium, February 1992, p. 7]<br><br>In his richly meaningful book<i>The Broken Heart,</i>Bruce C. Hafen provides deep insight into the power of the Atonement.<br><br><i>The Atonement not only pays for our sins, it heals our wounds--the self-inflicted ones and those inflicted from sources beyond our control. The Atonement also completes the process of our learning by perfecting our nature and making us whole. In this way, Christ's Atonement makes us as he is. It is the ultimate source of our forgiveness, our perfection, and our peace of mind.</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989, p. 29]<br><br>If you have any doubt whether or not you can be saved by the grace of the Savior, just read over the phenomenal testimony of Elder Packer in the April 1992 conference. Quoting Orson F. Whitney, he said,<br><br><i>The Prophet Joseph Smith declared--and he never taught a more comforting doctrine--that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father's heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>CR,</i>April 1929, p. 110]<br><br>Are you planning now to eventually be home with Jesus? He is planning on you!<br><br>We are given to know the absolute truths that are the basis for solid, stable self-acceptance:<br><br>1. We are literal spirit children of heavenly parents.<br><br>2. We are soul, body and spirit, and every soul will be resurrected.<br><br>3. Each person, each soul, is of infinite and eternal worth and value.<br><br>4. The influence of the Holy Ghost always produces joy and satisfaction.<br><br>5. Each person, each soul, is always loved.<br><br>6. We are totally dependent on Jesus for eternal life.<br><br>These are virtues we do not need to earn, nor, in fact, can we earn. They are gifts from God. They are the essence of our being. If we truly trusted these absolutes, nothing else would matter enough to make us choose sin.<br><br>What a marvelous blessing we have to be taught on this campus by men and women who love the Savior. How privileged we are to be directed by prophets of God, of whom the Lord has said, "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>You assembled here today are commissioned to bless the world.<br><br><i>And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</i>[3 Nephi 20:25]<br><br>We have been blessed to know the truth and given the responsibility to take that truth to all the world. Of all people, it makes no sense for us to feel that we are not worthy of him and his love. It keeps us from him. More than anything he wants us to walk with him every day. The adversary knows who you are and will continue to work doubly hard to deceive you, to keep you from fulfilling your covenant responsibilities, to make you miserable. How can we be a light to the world if we are trapped in the mist of darkness? How can we do Heavenly Father's will when we are obsessed with making a name for ourselves? Isaiah has prophesied that Israel will continually forsake the Lord, but the Lord will never forsake Israel.<br><br><i>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.</i>[1 Nephi 21:15–16]<br><br>Will we trust that we do belong to our Redeemer? Will we exercise the faith to see ourselves as the Lord sees us?<br><br>We are of infinite value and worth to Christ. As we love him, have faith in him, and desire to be like him, he is the one who will change us, perfect us, and bring us home. Then he will give us all that he hath. How could we want for anything else?<br><br>There is nothing greater than his love for us. It is my humblest prayer that we will know his love, we will accept his love into our lives and realize our total dependence on him. Then shall our "confidence wax strong" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45). Then shall we have true gratitude for who we are and marvel at his goodness to us. Then shall we know the amazing peace from him, even in this life, that peace "which passeth all understanding" (see D&amp;amp;C 59:23; Philippians 4:7).<br><br>I know that Jesus lives! I love and adore my Redeemer. Jesus is the source of all that is real. He longs for each of us to know that we are precious in his sight. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Barbara Day Lockhart was a professor in the Department of Physical Education at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 12 May 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>: Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am glad to be with you this evening. I pray that my message will be helpful to you in your current circumstances and throughout your lives.<br><br>The Lord warned the first generation of Latter-day Saints to "beware concerning yourselves" (D&amp;amp;C 84:43). That warning provides the preamble to my message. I seek to remind each of us of the mortal susceptibilities and the devilish diversions that can unite to produce our spiritual downfall.<br><br>Lehi taught that "it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass" (2 Nephi 2:11). In the realm of spiritual progress, that opposition is provided by the temptations of Satan. We learn in modern revelation that "it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves" (D&amp;amp;C 29:39).<br><br>President Marion G. Romney taught:<br><br><i>Latter-day Saints know that there is a God. With like certainty, they know that Satan lives, that he is a powerful personage of spirit, the archenemy of God, of man, and of righteousness.</i>["Satan--The Great Deceiver,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1971, p. 35]<br><br>President Romney then described one of Satan's methods:<br><br><i>Satan is a skillful imitator, and as genuine gospel truth is given the world in ever-increasing abundance, so he spreads the counterfeit coin of false doctrine.</i>[p. 36]<br><br>Satan uses every possible device to accomplish his purpose to degrade and enslave every soul. He attempts to distort and corrupt everything created for the good of man--sometimes by diluting that which is good, sometimes by camouflaging that which is evil. We generally think of Satan attacking us at our weakest spot. President Kimball described this technique when he said, "Lucifer and his followers know the habits, weaknesses, and vulnerable spots of everyone and take advantage of them to lead us to spiritual destruction" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], pp. 218–19).<br><br>Like the fabled Achilles, who was immune to every lethal blow except to his heel, many of us have a special weakness that can be exploited to our spiritual downfall. For some that weakness may be a taste for liquor. For some it may be an unusual vulnerability to sexual temptation or a susceptibility to compulsive gambling or reckless speculation. For others it may be a craving for money or power. If we are wise, we will know our special weaknesses, our spiritual Achilles' heels, and fortify ourselves against temptations in those areas.<br><br>But our weaknesses are not the only areas where we are vulnerable. Satan can also attack us where we think we are strong--in the very areas where we are proud of our strengths. He will approach us through the greatest talents and spiritual gifts we possess. If we are not wary, Satan can cause our spiritual downfall by corrupting us through our strengths as well as by exploiting our weaknesses. I will illustrate this truth with a score of examples.<br><br>1. My first example concerns Satan's efforts to corrupt a person who has an unusual commitment to one particular doctrine or commandment of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This could be an unusual talent for family history work, an extraordinary commitment to constitutional government, a special gift in the acquisition of knowledge, or any other special talent or commitment.<br><br>In a memorable message given at the 1971 October conference, Elder Boyd K. Packer likened the fulness of the gospel to a piano keyboard. He reminded us that a person could be "attracted by a single key," such as a doctrine they want to hear "played over and over again." He explained:<br><br><i>Some members of the Church who should know better pick out a hobby key or two and tap them incessantly, to the irritation of those around them. They can dull their own spiritual sensitivities. They lose track that there is a fulness of the gospel,</i>. . . [which they reject]<i>in preference to a favorite note. This becomes exaggerated and distorted, leading them away into apostasy.</i>[Boyd K. Packer,<i>Teach Ye Diligently</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1975), p. 44]<br><br>We could say of such persons, as the Lord said of the members of the Shaker sect in a revelation given in 1831, "Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know the truth in part, but not all" (D&amp;amp;C 49:2). And so, I say, beware of a hobby key. If you tap one key to the exclusion or serious detriment of the full harmony of the gospel keyboard, Satan can use your strength to bring you down.<br><br>2. Satan will also attempt to cause our spiritual downfall through tempting us to misapply our spiritual gifts. The revelations tell us that "there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11). All of these gifts "come from God, for the benefit of the children of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:26). Most of us have seen persons whom the adversary has led astray through a corruption of their spiritual gifts. My mother shared one such example, something she had observed while she was a student at BYU many years ago. A man who lived in a community in Utah had a mighty gift of healing. People sought him out for blessings, many coming from outside his ward and stake. In time, he made almost a profession of giving blessings. As part of his travels to various communities, he came to the apartments of BYU students, asking if they wanted blessings. This man had lost sight of the revealed direction on spiritual gifts: "always remembering for what they are given" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8). A spiritual gift is given to benefit the children of God, not to magnify the prominence or gratify the ego of the person who receives it. The professional healer who forgot that lesson gradually lost the companionship of the Spirit and was eventually excommunicated from the Church.<br><br>3. Another strength Satan can exploit to seek our downfall is a strong desire to understand everything about every principle of the gospel. How could that possibly work to our detriment? Experience teaches that if this desire is not disciplined, it can cause some to pursue their searchings past the fringes of orthodoxy, seeking answers to mysteries rather than a firmer understanding and a better practice of the basic principles of the gospel. Some seek answers to questions God has not chosen to answer. Others receive answers--or think they receive answers--in ways that are contrary to the order of the Church. For such searchers, Satan stands ready to mislead through sophistry or spurious revelation. Persons who hunger after a full understanding of all things must discipline their questions and their methods or they can get close to apostasy without even knowing it. It may be just as dangerous to exceed orthodoxy as it is to fall short of it. The safety and happiness we are promised lies in keeping the commandments, not in discounting them or multiplying them.<br><br>4. Closely related to this example is the person who has a strong desire to be led by the Spirit of the Lord but unwisely extends that strength to the point of desiring to be led in<i>all</i>things. A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for our personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality. Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances where they pray for guidance and don't receive it. For example, this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances where the choices are trivial or w here either choice is acceptable. We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it, and upon our best judgment if we do not. Persons who persist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or they may even receive an answer through the medium of false revelation. Revelation from God is a sacred reality, but like other sacred things it must be cherished and used properly so that a great strength does not become a disabling weakness.<br><br>Each one of these examples of how our strengths can become our downfall could be the subject of an entire talk, but the number of illustrations I wish to give forces me to limit my comments on each of them.<br><br>5. The honors we sometimes receive from our peers are potentially a strength, but we need to remember that Satan can turn these to our detriment also. We must be careful that we do not become like the prophet Balaam. The Apostle Peter said that Balaam "loved the wages of unrighteousness" (2 Peter 2:15), which Elder McConkie interpreted as "the honors of men and the wealth of the world" (Bruce R. McConkie,<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary,</i>vol. 3 [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973], p. 361). Honors may come, but we should beware that they not deflect our priorities and commitments away from the things of God.<br><br>6. A willingness to sacrifice all we possess in the work of the Lord is surely a strength. In fact, it is a covenant we make in sacred places. But even this strength can bring us down if we fail to confine our sacrifices to those things the Lord and his leaders have asked of us at this time. We should say with Alma, "Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?" (Alma 29:6). Persons who consider it insufficient to pay their tithes and offerings and to work in the positions to which they have been called can easily be led astray by cultist groups and other bizarre outlets for their willingness to sacrifice.<br><br>7. Some persons have a finely developed social conscience. They respond to social injustice and suffering with great concern, commitment, and generosity. This is surely a spiritual strength, something many of us need in greater measure. Yet persons who have this great quality need to be cautious that it not impel them to overstep other ultimate values. My social conscience should not cause me to coerce others to use their time or means to fulfill my objectives. We are not blessed for magnifying our calling with someone else's time or resources. We are commanded to<i>love</i>our neighbors, not to<i>manipulate</i>them, even for righteous purposes. In the same way, we should not feel alienated from our church or its leaders when they refrain from using the rhetoric of the social gospel or from allocating Church resources to purposes favored by others. We should remember that the Lord has given his restored Church a unique mission not given to others. We must concentrate our primary efforts on those activities that can only be accomplished with priesthood authority, such as preaching the gospel and redeeming the dead.<br><br>8. There is great strength in being highly focused on our goals. We have all seen the favorable fruits of that focus. Yet an intense focus on goals can cause a person to forget the importance of righteous<i>means.</i>When I was serving in a stake presidency, a man bragged to me about the way he had managed to preserve his goal of perfect attendance at our stake leadership meetings. He was required to report for his shift work at the time of one of our stake meetings. When the employer denied his request for permission to attend this church meeting, he told me with pride that he "called in sick" so he could come anyway. I kept an eye on that man after that. I wondered if he would steal money in order to pay his tithing. You may think that an extreme example, but it illustrates the point I wish to make. We cannot be so concerned about our goals that we overlook the necessity of using righteous methods to attain them.<br><br>9. Another illustration of a strength that can become our downfall concerns the charismatic teacher. With a trained mind and a skillful manner of presentation, a teacher can become unusually popular and effective in teaching. But Satan will try to use that strength to corrupt the teacher by encouraging him or her to gather a following of disciples. A Church or Church education teacher or LDS university professor who gathers such a following and does this "for the sake of riches and honor" (Alma 1:16) is guilty of priestcraft.<br><br><i>Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</i>[2 Nephi 26:29]<br><br>Teachers who are most popular--and therefore most effective--have a special susceptibility to this form of priestcraft. If they are not careful, their strength can become their spiritual downfall. They can become like Almon Babbitt, with whom the Lord was not well pleased because, as the revelation states,<br><br><i>He aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a golden calf for the worship of my people.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 124:84]<br><br>10. The family, the most sacred institution in mortality, is a setting in which Satan is especially anxious to use strengths to bring about our downfall. My first illustration under this heading is addressed to breadwinners. The Bible says that it is a gift of God to rejoice in our labors (see Ecclesiastes 5:19). But that strength can be corrupted. Our labors, and the prosperity and recognition we achieve by them, can easily become a god we place ahead of him who said, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3). Carried to excess, a love of and commitment to work can also become an excuse to neglect family and church responsibilities. Most of us could cite more than one illustration of that reality.<br><br>11. At an even more sensitive level, a man's righteous desire to act in his position as a leader in his family, if not righteously exercised, can lead him into self-righteousness, selfishness, dictatorship, and even brutality. A timely warning against this danger is the Lord's blunt instruction that it is the nature and disposition of those who have a little authority to exercise unrighteous dominion (see D&amp;amp;C 121:39). We must all heed the direction that priesthood authority must be exercised by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned (verse 41).<br><br>12. By the same token, a woman's righteous and appropriate desires to grow and develop and magnify her talents--desires strongly reinforced by current feminist teachings--also have their extreme manifestations, which can lead to attempts to preempt priesthood leadership, to the advocacy of ideas out of harmony with Church doctrine, or even to the abandonment of family responsibilities.<br><br>13. Another area in which strengths can become our downfall concerns finances. We are commanded to give to the poor. Could the fulfillment of that fundamental Christian obligation be carried to excess? I believe it can, and I believe I have seen examples of this. Perhaps you have also seen cases where persons fulfilled that duty to such an extent that they impoverished their own families by expending resources of property or time that were needed for family members. Perhaps this excess explains why King Benjamin, who commanded his people to impart of their substance to the poor, "feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally" (Mosiah 4:26), also cautioned them to "see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (verse 27). Similarly, a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith during the time he was translating the Book of Mormon cautioned him, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4).<br><br>14. Other illustrations of how our strengths can become our downfall concern the activity of learning.<br><br>A desire to know is surely a great strength. A hunger to learn is laudable, but the fruits of learning make a person particularly susceptible to the sin of pride. So do the fruits of other talents and accomplishments, such as the athletic or the artistic. It is easy for the learned and the accomplished to forget their own limitations and their total dependence upon God.<br><br>Accomplishments in higher education bring persons much recognition and real feelings of self-sufficiency. But we should remember the Book of Mormon's frequent cautions not to boast in our own strength or wisdom lest we be left to our own strength or wisdom (e.g., Alma 38:11, 39:2; Helaman 4:13, 16:15). Similarly, the prophet Jacob referred to "that cunning plan of the evil one," remarking that when persons are "learned," which means that they have knowledge, "they think they are wise" (2 Nephi 9:28), which means that they think they have the capacity for the wise application of knowledge. Persons who think they are wise in this way "hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves." In that circumstance, the prophet said, "their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish" (2 Nephi 9:28). "But to be learned is good," the word of the Lord concludes, "if they hearken unto the counsels of God" (2 Nephi 9:29).<br><br>15. Another example: An unusual degree of faith in God, a genuine spiritual gift and strength, can be distorted so as to seriously detract from scholarly pursuits. I have known persons who began their academic studies with great momentum, but as time went by did not continue to invest the time they needed in their studies because they supposed they had developed such great faith that if they simply did their church work the Lord would bless them to achieve their academic objectives. In this way the supposed strength of their faith became the cause of their academic downfall. We might say to them as the Lord said to Oliver Cowdery when he failed in his efforts to translate:<br><br><i>Behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . You have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:5, 7–8]<br><br>Here the Lord counsels us on balance. Faith is vital, but it must be accompanied by the personal work appropriate to the task. Only then do we qualify for the blessing. The appropriate approach for students is to study as if everything depended upon them and then to pray and exercise faith as if everything depended upon the Lord.<br><br>16. A related strength that can be corrupted to the downfall of a student is a desire to excel in a church calling. I remember a graduate student who used his church service as a means of escape from the rigors of his studies. He went beyond what we call church-service time and became almost a full-time church-service worker, consistently volunteering for every extra assignment and giving help that was greatly appreciated in the various organizations and activities of the Church, but finally failing in his studies and blaming his failure on the excessive burden of his church work. His strength became his downfall.<br><br>Similarly, I remember the concerns President Harold B. Lee expressed to me when I was president of BYU. Shortly before the Provo Temple was dedicated, he told me of his concern that the accessibility of the temple would cause some BYU students to attend the temple so often that they would neglect their studies. He urged me to work with the BYU stake presidents to make sure that the students understood that even something as sacred and important as temple service needed to be done in wisdom and order so that the students would not neglect the studies that should be the major focus of their time during their student years.<br><br>17. Leaving the list of dangers peculiar to students, I come to the subject of patriotism. Love of country is surely a strength, but carried to excess it can become the cause of spiritual downfall. There are some citizens whose patriotism (as they define it) is so intense and so all-consuming that it seems to override every other responsibility, including family and church. For example, I caution those patriots who are participating in or provisioning private armies and making private preparations for armed conflict. Their excessive zeal for one aspect of patriotism is causing them to risk spiritual downfall as they withdraw from the society of the Church and from the governance of those civil authorities to whom our article of faith makes all of us subject.<br><br>18. Another strength that can become our downfall stems from self-reliance. We are told to be self-reliant, to provide for ourselves and those dependent upon us. But success at that effort can easily escalate into materialism. This happens through carrying the virtue of "providing for our own" to the point of excess concern with accumulating the treasures of the earth. I believe this relationship identifies materialism as a peculiar Mormon weakness, a classic example of how Satan can persuade some to drive a legitimate strength to such excess that it becomes a disabling weakness.<br><br>19. A desire to follow a prophet is surely a great and appropriate strength, but even this has its potentially dangerous manifestations. I have heard of more than one group who are so intent on following the words of a dead prophet that they have rejected the teachings and counsel of the living ones. Satan has used that corruption from the beginning of the Restoration. You will recall Joseph Smith's direction for the Saints to gather in Kirtland, Ohio, then in Missouri, and then in Illinois. At each place along the way, a certain number of Saints fell away, crying "fallen prophet" as their excuse for adhering to the earlier words and rejecting the current direction. The same thing happened after the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith, when some Saints seized upon one statement or another by the deceased prophet as a basis for sponsoring or joining a new group that rejected the counsel of the living ones.<br><br>Following the prophet is a great strength, but it needs to be consistent and current lest it lead to the spiritual downfall that comes from rejecting continuous revelation. Under that principle, the most important difference between dead prophets and living ones is that those who are dead are not here to receive and declare the Lord's latest words to his people. If they were, there would be no differences among the messages of the prophets.<br><br>A related distortion is seen in the practice of those who select a few sentences from the teachings of a prophet and use these to support their political agenda or other personal purposes. In doing so, they typically ignore the contrary implications of other prophetic words, or even the clear example of the prophet's own actions. For example, I have corresponded with several Church members who sought to use something President Benson is quoted as saying as a basis for refusing to file an income-tax return or to pay income taxes. I have tried to persuade these persons that their interpretation cannot be what President Benson intended, because both he and his predecessors in that sacred office, and all of the General Authorities, have faithfully filed their income-tax returns and paid the taxes required by law. The servants of God are under the Master's commands to follow him and to be examples to the flock (1 Timothy 4:12; 1 Peter 5:3). We should interpret their words in the light of their walk. To wrest the words of a prophet to support a private agenda, political or financial or otherwise, is to try to<i>manipulate</i>the prophet, not to<i>follow</i>him.<br><br>20. Other strengths that can be used for our downfall are the gifts of love and tolerance. Clearly, these are great virtues. Love is an ultimate quality, and tolerance is its handmaiden. Love and tolerance are pluralistic, and that is their strength, but it is also the source of their potential weakness. Love and tolerance are incomplete unless they are accompanied by a concern for truth and a commitment to the unity God has commanded of his servants.<br><br>Carried to an undisciplined excess, love and tolerance can produce indifference to truth and justice and opposition to unity. What makes mankind "free" from death and sin is not merely love but love accompanied by truth: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). And the test of whether we are the Lord's is not just love and tolerance, but unity. "If ye are not one," the risen Lord said, "ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27). To follow the Lord's example of love, we must remember his explanation that "whom I love I also chasten" (D&amp;amp;C 95:1) and also that he chastens us "that [we] might be one" (D&amp;amp;C 61:8).<br><br>At this point, as I draw near to my conclusion, I need to caution myself and each of my listeners that the very nature of this message could tend to the same downfall that it warns against. This idea that our strengths can become our weaknesses could be understood to imply that we should have "moderation in all things." But the Savior said that if we are lukewarm, he will spue us out of his mouth (see Revelation 3:16). Moderation in<i>all</i>things is not a virtue because it would seem to justify moderation in commitment. That is not moderation but indifference. That kind of "moderation" runs counter to the divine commands to serve with all of our "heart, might, mind and strength" (D&amp;amp;C 4:2), to "seek . . . earnestly the riches of eternity" (D&amp;amp;C 68:31), and to be "valiant in the testimony of Jesus" (D&amp;amp;C 76:79). Moderation is not the answer.<br><br>How, then, do we prevent our strengths from becoming our downfall? The quality we must cultivate is humility. Humility is the great protector. Humility is the antidote against pride. Humility is the catalyst for all learning, especially spiritual things.<br><br>Through the prophet Ether, the Lord gave us this great insight into the role of humility:<br><br><i>I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>We might also say that if men and women humble themselves before God, he will help them prevent their strengths from becoming weaknesses that the adversary can exploit to destroy them.<br><br>If we are meek and humble enough to receive counsel, the Lord can and will guide us through the counsel of our parents, our teachers, and our leaders. The proud can only hear the clamor of the crowd, but a person who "becometh as a child"--as King Benjamin said, "submissive, meek [and] humble" (Mosiah 3:19)--can hear and follow the still small voice by which our Father in Heaven guides his children who are receptive.<br><br>A person who engages in self-congratulation over a supposed strength has lost the protection of humility and is vulnerable to Satan's using that strength to produce his or her downfall. In contrast, if we are humble and teachable, hearkening to the commandments of God, the counsel of his leaders, and the promptings of his spirit, we can be guided. We can be guided in how to use our spiritual gifts, our accomplishments, and all of our other strengths for righteousness. And we can be guided in how to avoid Satan's efforts to use our strengths to cause our downfall.<br><br>In all of this, we should remember and rely on the Lord's direction and promise:<br><br><i>Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 112:10]<br><br>I testify that this is true, even as I testify of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose atoning sacrifice has brought to pass the Resurrection and will bring to pass all righteousness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 June 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
In a Facetious Little Essay entitled "On Transcendental Metaworry,"<sup>1</sup>the science writer Lewis Thomas observes that "Worrying is the most natural and spontaneous of all human functions. . . . Man is the Worrying Animal." This rare capacity to worry, Thomas continues, "is a trait needing further development, awaiting perfection. Most of us tend to neglect the activity, living precariously out on the thin edge of anxiety but never plunging in." To remedy this, Thomas recommends the practice of Transcendental Worry (or TW), preferably "before work and late in the evening just before insomnia."<br><br>To practice TW, Thomas recommends the following: make yourself as uncomfortable as possible; tense all your muscles; close your eyes tight "until the effort causes a slight tremor of the eyelids"; focus on the muscular effort required to breathe (preferably attempting to breathe through one nostril at a time); then repeat to yourself a suitable mantra like "worry." Soon you will experience the vertiginous pleasures of angst. Worries will circle in and out of your consciousness like carrion fowl--swirling images of burning rain forests, swelling pimples, unpaid Visa bills, the national debt, the Testing Center, expanding waistlines, receding hairlines, late papers, and finals in classes you never attended. Surrender yourself wholly to this sense of anxiety. Then, if you are blessed with the right nervous temperament, you will sink into the final stage of TW: "pure worry about pure worry." At this point you will have attained what Thomas calls "the Wisdom of the West," or TMW, "Transcendental Metaworry."<br><br>I confess that sometimes late at night, between wake and sleep, I experience this rarefied state of TMW, or worry about worry. I speak today as one personally familiar with what a song from the sixties called the "chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty."<sup>2</sup>I do so, however, in order to speak of faith and hope, with which I am also intimately acquainted.<br><br>According to Parley P. Pratt, the pioneers who endured the first terrible winter in the Salt Lake valley suffered more from fear than from actual hunger.<sup>3</sup>Think about that. Remember how hungry the Saints were: "The people tried eating crows, thistle tops, bark, roots, and Sego Lily bulbs--anything that might offer nutriment or fill the empty stomach."<sup>4</sup>Yet they suffered most from fear. For "the valley was new," says Brother Pratt, "ne[i]ther was it proven that grain could be raised."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Uncertainty can be more chilling than winter, doubt more gnawing than hunger, tempests of the mind more fearful than pelting rain. As Shakespeare's King Lear remarks: "This tempest in my mind / Doth from my senses take all feeling else, / Save what beats there" (3.4.12–14).<br><br>And, in a similar vein, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn describes a peculiar reaction evident in many people picked up by the Soviet secret police: "Sometimes the principal emotion of the person arrested is relief and even<i>happiness!"</i>After all, Solzhenitsyn explains, there is a kind of exhaustion that is "worse than any kind of arrest." He illustrates this point with the example of a priest who, having eluded arrest for eight years, "suffered so painfully from this harried life that when he was finally arrested in 1942 he sang hymns of praise to God."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Not knowing<i>when</i>or<i>if</i>an affliction will end is often more taxing than the affliction itself. This kind of suffering, which I call the ordeal within the ordeal, constitutes a perennial human predicament. Thus all ages echo the ancient cry "How long, O Lord, how long?"<sup>7</sup>We suppose that we could brave most any hardship, provided we knew if and when it would pass. Think how patiently, for example, you older single students would bear being unmarried if you knew that in three years you would marry a good person--or, alternatively, that you would never marry. It is not being single but the uncertainty that can seem unendurable. Likewise, think how stoically you married students would cope with being poor if you were sure that your plight was temporary, that in time you would be able to afford the home you desire and find the employment you have prepared for. How much more courageously and cheerfully would we endure our trials if we knew their outcome. Why, we might face even death more boldly if we but knew the time of our demise.<br><br>In periods of prolonged distress, we yearn for the Lord to carry us to a mountaintop, as he did Moses, and there reveal in detail the course of our lives (cf. Moses 1). Instead, God requires us to wander like Abraham, as "strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (Hebrews 11:13), living on promises. To live on this side of the veil is to "walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7); it is to "feel after" the Lord (see Acts 17:27; D&amp;amp;C 101:8) as he lights our way home, one step at a time.<br><br>We have just sung lines by John Henry Newman that express this theme. Newman wrote "Lead, Kindly Light" aboard ship on the way home to England from Italy. He was homesick and seasick; he had just had malaria. Though he didn't know it yet, he was also about to take the first faltering steps of a spiritual pilgrimage that ultimately would lead him, and many who followed him, to another church. In these circumstances, Newman writes:<br><br><i>Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom;<br>Lead thou me on!<br>The night is dark, and I am far from home;<br>Lead thou me on!<br>Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br>The distant scene--one step enough for me.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 97]<br><br>The last line contains a phrase that became a motto for my wife, Susan, and me through long years of uncertainty in graduate school: "I do not ask to see the distant scene--<i>one step enough</i>for me."<br><br>"One step enough." How often Susan and I have taken comfort in this phrase. Yet even with those words on our lips, we still trod gingerly into a future that seemed so precarious and into which we could see safe footing for only one small step ahead. We craved precisely what we professed not to ask for--namely, to see the distant scene. Like most everybody, we yearn for certainty and would avoid risk, if we could--or at least consign it to a risk manager. (What an intriguing modern invention, risk management. Wouldn't it be great if we could give over life's truly serious risks, like whom to marry or what to believe, to someone else?) Suspense makes us, well, nervous. Susan is the kind of reader who sometimes skips to the end of the novel when the suspense becomes too intense. I am the kind of fan who sometimes opts to watch a close game on replay,<i>after</i>I know the outcome.<br><br>The dramas of our own lives, however, are not available to us on video or in novels. We can neither fast forward nor read ahead. Because our tribulations unfold in real time, the only way out, alas, is through. This means we must endure not only our hardships but the ordeal of anxiety within the ordeal; it means we must live on promises and walk by faith.<br><br>To walk by faith is to follow in the footsteps of Abraham, the spiritual father of the faithful (Galatians 3:7), who must sojourn as pilgrims and strangers on this earth. In Hebrews we read:<br><br><i>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,</i>not knowing whither he went.<br><br><i>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.</i>[Hebrews 11:8–9; emphasis added]<br><br>"Not knowing whither he went," Abraham left not only his city but city life itself, in the cradle of civilization, to become a nomad. As Abraham so aptly puts it:<br><br><i>Therefore, eternity was our covering and our rock and our salvation, as we journeyed from Haran . . . to come to the land of Canaan.</i>[Abraham 2:16]<br><br>Moreover, Abraham did not cease to be a nomad after he arrived in the promised land. Rather, even in Canaan he dwelt "in tabernacles" (i.e., tents), "as in a strange [i.e., foreign] country." While his nephew Lot chose to live "in the cities" on the well-watered plain of Jordan (Genesis 13:10–12)--and reaped the consequence of that choice--Abraham dwelt not in cities. "For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10), and taught us by his example that "here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come" (Hebrews 13:14).<br><br>As Abram wandered through Canaan, he was promised the land over and over again (cf. Genesis 12:1–3, 7; 13:14–17; 15:18; 17:1–8). Yet when Sarah died, Abraham had to buy the cave of Machpelah in which to bury her. How poignant are Abraham's words to the sons of Heth, from whom he purchased the cave:<br><br><i>I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</i>[Genesis 23:4]<br><br>The land was Abraham's by covenant, yet near the end of his life he did not even own a plot of ground sufficient to inter Sarah's body. Later, Abraham was buried in this same cave, the only property he ever owned in Canaan (Genesis 25:9–10). No wonder Stephen the Martyr says that the Lord gave Abraham "none inheritance" in Canaan, "no, not so much as to set his foot on," but promised only that he<i>would</i>give Abraham the land "for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child" (Acts 7:5).<br><br>Abraham spent all his days living on promises--not only with respect to the promised land but also with respect to a promised posterity. With what could seem like cruel irony, the Lord repeatedly pledged Abram posterity as numerous as the dust of the earth and the stars of heaven (Genesis 13:16; 15:4–5; 17:2–4; 18:17–19; 22:16–18). He also changed his name to Abraham, meaning<i>father of a multitude.</i>Yet all the while Abraham had no promised heir; all the while he and Sarah were growing older.<br><br>At last, of course, Isaac was born. Then the God of Abraham, who seems to have a keen sense of irony, required the sacrifice of the very child through whom the prophecies that Abraham's seed would become "a great and mighty nation" were to be fulfilled (Genesis 18:18). How is it that Abraham "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief" (Romans 4:20), but "believed in the Lord," who "counted it to him for righteousness" (Genesis 15:6; cf. Galatians 3:6).<br><br>We distort the trials of Abraham (or of anyone else) if we read them from the comfortable retrospective of history. Rather, as Kierkegaard reminds us, we must remember the fear and trembling.<sup>8</sup>We must flee with Abram from Haran, not knowing whither we go, with eternity as our rock; we must wander with Abram in Canaan, living on increasingly incredible promises about possessing the land and a great posterity; we must journey with Abraham to Mount Moriah, prepare the altar for Isaac, and lift the knife. We must, in short, become "contemporaneous"<sup>9</sup>with Abraham in his trials. Only then will we begin to understand why Abraham is the father to the faithful, the model for all those who, like him, die<br><br><i>in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</i><br><br><i>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</i>[Hebrews 11:13–14, 16]<br><br>The scriptures are replete with examples of Abrahamic faith. Lehi's example comes readily to mind. Like Abraham, Lehi fled from his home, "dwelt in a tent," and was led by faith to a better country. Also like Abraham, Lehi seems to have left Jerusalem "not knowing whither he went." Nephi's account, at any rate, depicts Lehi first fleeing into the wilderness and only later learning that the Lord intended to lead him to a new world (cf. 1 Nephi 2). That Lehi's family made several return trips to Jerusalem may be explained, in part, by their unfolding knowledge of the journey they were undertaking. Perhaps they had to learn that their exile was to be an exodus.<br><br>Likewise, missionaries in every age have always had to walk by faith--from the sons of Mosiah, who journeyed to the land of the Lamanites on the strength of prophetic promises (Mosiah 28:7; Alma 17:10–12), to modern-day missionaries like Wilford Woodruff, who followed the Spirit's prompting to go south to Hertfordshire, where he baptized hundreds.<sup>10</sup>All those who embrace the gospel become the progeny of Abraham (Abraham 2:10; Galatians 3:7) and like him have to walk by faith, one step at a time.<br><br>This includes prophets of our day. I will never forget a conversation with President Harold B. Lee that taught me this. President Lee (who, by the way, loved the hymn "Lead, Kindly Light") had talked freely that day about a new program the Church had just announced. He then remarked that he had just reread the minutes of the meetings in which the program had been formulated and that he saw now, in retrospect, that the Lord had been guiding the deliberations all along. What a remarkable description of revelation! The Lord's guidance was not fully evident, even to his prophet, until President Lee turned to survey the terrain he had traversed. The Lord led his servant, yes, but one step at a time.<br><br>This lesson impressed me, but it should not have surprised me. For even Jesus "received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace. . . . And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first" (D&amp;amp;C 93:12, 14). He was called the Son<i>because</i>he received not of the fulness at the first. Does this imply that Jesus' human limitations define the essence of his sonship (or mortality), just as they do ours? Does this mean that he had to learn his mission incrementally and live through trials without knowing the beginning from the end? I note that the Lord often had to fast and pray to obtain the Father's unfolding will. And Jesus' astonishing plea that he "might not drink the bitter cup" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18) suggests that the Savior's prescience of the Atonement did not preclude his very human apprehension about the ensuing ordeal. In this, as "in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren" (Hebrews 2:17). "For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but took on him the seed of Abraham" (Hebrews 2:16).<br><br>Now, lest anyone think these examples of faith too remote, I wish now to speak more personally, sharing my own experiences and those of others who have influenced me. I do so not to boast but to bear witness of heaven's mercies and miracles. I do so in gratitude to God and with the hope that my experiences might give others courage to hope.<br><br>I come from a heritage of Abrahamic faith. Shortly after the original John Tanner was converted, he felt prompted to sell his beautiful farm in Lake George, New York, and move to Kirtland, Ohio--not knowing he was led there by the Spirit to help rescue the Church from severe debt. Several more times he and his family left everything to follow the Saints--from Kirtland to Jackson, from Jackson to Nauvoo, from Nauvoo to Salt Lake. With each move Father Tanner and his family became poorer; with each dislocation they had to start anew. But because eternity was their rock, they left their progeny a legacy of faith more precious than gold.<br><br>My paternal grandparents lost two grocery stores in the Depression. Their sole remaining possession of value was a home. Then came a mission call to their oldest son, my uncle, who assumed it was impossible for him to serve. "Of course you will go," his parents told him. They sold their home and moved into an attic apartment. Friends were very critical, and, from a practical point of view, their criticism was justified, for my grandparents lived many more years but never again owned a home of their own. Yet they gave their sons, including my father, something more valuable than an estate. They gave them an Abrahamic legacy of faith.<br><br>Likewise, my own parents have walked with a faith of truly biblical proportions. Despite a world war, long years of school, and never knowing financial stability, they got the education and had the family they felt the Lord expected of them. Mom walked across the stage to receive her diploma when she was expecting her first child. Six of us had been born by the time Dad received his Ph.D. Seven more children were still to come, this despite constant economic uncertainty from my father's self-employment. Yet my parents sent ten children on missions, often with more than one in the field at once, and made sure that all thirteen graduated from college.<br><br>My folks worked very hard for this. And we, too, were expected to sacrifice: to save for missions, to put ourselves through college. But besides hard work, my parents exhibited heroic faith.<br><br>In stories like these it is easy--too easy--to see the faith and miss the fear. But you can't miss the fear and trembling when it is your own history. In 1974, when I was a senior at BYU, the job market for English professors was desperately tight and predicted to get much worse. It seemed only prudent to do something practical, like apply to law school. But as I wrote Duke Law School the obligatory essay on "Why I Want to Be an Attorney When I Grow Up," it struck me, with the force of revelation, that I did<i>not</i>want to be an attorney. I wanted to teach, preferably Renaissance literature. What's more, I felt the Lord wanted me to teach. So I tore up my essay and applied instead to graduate school in English. The distant scene seemed so uncertain; all the forecasts said not to follow the less-trodden path I was taking. Yet the little light that illuminated my feet seemed to point to graduate school. A way was soon opened up for me to go to the University of California at Berkeley, but only one step ahead.<br><br>At about the same time that I tore up my law school application, I got engaged. I was painfully aware that all I had to offer my bride were long years in graduate school and then the prospect of no employment in my chosen field. Plus, I had only enough money for one quarter's tuition. Susan and I also both wanted children and felt this was our first priority. I was inexpressibly happy about my marriage, but also very anxious about the uncertain future. So I sought a blessing from my father. I received, like Abraham, promises--cherished, treasured promises, but nothing you could take to the loan officer at the bank: the Lord is mindful of your desires; he knows your concerns and approves this marriage; the way will be opened to complete your education through means you cannot now conceive.<br><br>Six long years and four children later I had my degree and, miraculously, a job in my field. Way after way had indeed been opened before us. For example, a housesitting job that we thought would last only a few months became, through the generosity of saintly Jim and Roma Sabine, three years of rent-free housing. I was able to find full-time night-watchman jobs at which I could study all night and go to school all day. And even when we were making only sixty dollars a month on my early-morning seminary salary, we paid tithing. The Lord was on our right hand and on our left, lighting our way one step at a time.<br><br>Many times I doubted the future. I could meet the present distress but was anxious about the future. How often would I lament: "What am I doing to myself and my family! There are no jobs in English. I can't complete a Ph.D. anyway. After all, I almost flunked freshman English. I can't write. I can't even spell. What madness to think I can do a dissertation!"<br><br>Still the years stretched on. Still anxiety enveloped my faith. My former roommates completed law school, took real jobs, bought cars and homes. My best friend went on to clerk at the Supreme Court. I, meanwhile, pulled weeds at the Oakland Temple as a gardener and worried about completing a seemingly interminable degree. Yet I persisted, borrowing generously from the faith of my wife, whose unshakable conviction that teaching was my vocation kept us walking down an uncertain path, one step at a time.<br><br>How much more courageously could I have lived on promises had my faith been as strong as hers. I am reminded of the ending of John Bunyan's<i>The Pilgrim's Progress,</i>which portrays Christian and Hopeful crossing the river of death. There "was no bridge to go over," Bunyan writes, and "the river was very deep." The two pilgrims begin to despair, for there is no way across except through. Then they learn this truth: "You shall find it [the river] deeper or shallower, as you believe in the King of the place."<sup>11</sup>Susan generally finds the river shallower than I. Both of us, however, have to wade through rivers with bottoms we cannot see.<br><br>As do all who sojourn through mortality. To be human is to be a pilgrim and stranger, homeward bound. No mortal ever ceases to need faith, for faith is a "task for a whole lifetime."<sup>12</sup>Indeed, to believe, to love, to repent, to forgive--these tasks are always more than enough for any human life. Nor do moderns start ahead of the ancients with respect to eternally significant tasks such as faith and love. We all start where Adam and Eve did as they left the garden. Let me borrow from Milton's account of this moment in the concluding lines of<i>Paradise Lost:</i><br><br><i>The World was all before them, where to choose<br>Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:<br>They hand in hand with wand'ring steps and slow,<br>Through Eden took thir solitary way.</i><br>[12.646–49]<br><br>So the world that lies before us bids us "choose our place of rest" and offers us Providence as our guide. If we are lucky, we will find someone to hold hands with as, "with wandering steps and slow," we make our "solitary way" toward home.<br><br>Now, since it has been much on my mind this past year, I want to illustrate my theme with one final personal example. This example is drawn from my recent experience drafting an academic freedom policy for BYU. Then I will offer one caution, and then I am done.<br><br>About a year ago, Bruce Hafen asked me to chair a committee that would draft recommendations on academic freedom. Knowing this issue had swamped far larger vessels than my small craft, I did what any of you would have done. I had an anxiety attack and looked for the nearest exit. Over the next several months, I tried lots of creative evasion strategies, but I also felt a growing conviction that maybe, just maybe, this was work I was supposed to do. Perhaps, unknown to me, this is why I studied Milton and Kierkegaard, two ardent advocates of liberty and faith. I felt the tug of Mordecai's question to Esther: "And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" So, like Esther, I went forward, resolving, "And if I perish, I perish" (Esther 4:14, 16).<br><br>Way after way seemed to open as my committee came up against seemingly impossible impasses. For this, I thank both heaven and the hard work, intelligence, and goodwill of my committee. I do not say the work that we have done is inspired in every point; we have already received many good suggestions for improvements. But when I look back at where we have been, the journey that sometimes seemed tortuous and circuitous in the treading of it now seems straighter and more purposeful. I hope this work will bless the university. This has been the only intention of every member of the committee. And I hope that as BYU continues to nurture a community of thoughtful faith, it will also grow as a community of charity that remembers that the prayer "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (Mark 9:24) is the prayer of a believer.<br><br>Now the final caution I promised. What I have said today does not mean that we should seek out risk, court anxiety, or take reckless chances. There is a difference between foolhardiness and faith. If you are the sort of person who likes risks, this is not the talk for you. We have an obligation to prepare for the future, to count the cost before we build, to study out decisions intelligently as well as prayerfully. We should be careful, and we should be wise.<br><br>Nevertheless, we must not trust only in our own wisdom. As George Santayana asserts,<br><br><i>It is not wisdom to be only wise,<br>And on the inward vision close the eyes,<br>But it is wisdom to believe the heart.<br>Columbus found a world, and had no chart,<br>Save one that faith deciphered in the skies; . . . .</i><br><br><i>Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine<br>That lights the pathway but one step ahead<br>Across a void of mystery and dread.<br>Bid, then, the tender light of faith to shine<br>By which alone the mortal heart is led<br>Unto the thinking of the thought divine.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>May the Lord light our various pathways, though it be "but one step ahead / Across a void of mystery and dread." And may we, as covenant children of Abraham, have the faith to follow that heavenly light home. This I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>John S.

<h1>d’s Side” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I express my sincere gratitude for this opportunity to be with you at this fireside tonight. I bring you greetings and best wishes from the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles. I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us tonight and what is said may be of benefit to all of us.<br><br>I am always refreshed and encouraged when I visit the youth of the Church because of your vigor, enthusiasm, hope, and faith. Your attendance at BYU and Utah Valley Community College, which represents one of the stakes invited to this fireside, indicates that you desire to study where you can learn the gospel while you complete your college education. Many of you are near the beginning of your productive lives. You will soon be leaders and examples to your families, the Church, governments, and communities.<br><br>I repeat what you have heard many times before: Perhaps you will have greater opportunities, but you will face increased challenges and problems than any generation before you. Your most important opportunity will be to help prepare a people to meet the Savior at his second coming. You will be challenged to live by the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in the small but cumulative choices and decisions you make each day and to follow the counsel of the Lord to his people as given to his servants, the prophets and apostles.<br><br>I join with President Gordon B. Hinckley in referring to the young people of the Church as the "finest generation" in its history, truly "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9). If you will be true and faithful to the values and principles you have been taught, you will rise above the "sordid elements of the world about you" (see "A Chosen Generation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, pp. 69–71).<br><br>I would like you to consider with me one of the great hymns of the Restoration: "Who's on the Lord's Side?" written by Hannah Last Cornaby, born in 1822 and an English convert to the Church. The words of this hymn seem particularly attuned to our time and society. The hymn impressed me when I was a small boy in the Salt Lake City Thirty-third Ward. It apparently was our Sunday School chorister's favorite song; we seemed to sing it every Sunday. We young children would leave Sunday School singing, "Who's on the Lord's side? Who? Now is the time to show." The words and melody would stay in our minds after we sang it. In fact, I've never forgotten it or our chorister.<br><br>The words of the hymn echo the words of Moses as he called the rebellious children of Israel to repentance after he had destroyed the idolatrous calf they had made. "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me. . . . Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord" (Exodus 32:26, 29).<br><br>Joshua, who succeeded Moses, told the children of Israel essentially the same thing after he had led them into their promised land of Canaan. Shortly before his death, he called the people of Israel together for a final blessing and warning, much as Moses had done. What a prophet says as he nears the end of his life is very important because he is concluding his accountability and placing the full responsibility for others' conduct on their own shoulders. Joshua reviewed with Israel exactly what God had done for them miraculously and then exhorted them to<br><br><i>Choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</i>[Joshua 24:15,24]<br><br>We, too, must choose whether we will serve our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, or follow the gods of indulgence and sin that clamor for our attention on every side.<br><br>The Lord has left no doubt in defining his side and where the Saints should be in their thoughts, words, actions, and practices. We have his counsel in the scriptures and in the words of the prophets. To ancient Israel, the Lord said through Moses: "I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil" (Deuteronomy 30:15). The Lord counseled his prophet Jeremiah to instruct the people: "Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death" (Jeremiah 21:8). That is the contrast; that is the choice. Either we are on the Lord's side of the line or on the side of the adversary. Nephi declared that we "are free to act for [ourselves]--to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life" (2 Nephi 10:23). Yes,<br><br><i>Men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>The line between those who are on the Lord's side and those who follow the adversary has been with us from the beginning. Even before the creation of this world, the children of God divided themselves into two groups with different loyalties. One-third of the host of heaven followed Lucifer, separating themselves from the presence of God and from the two-thirds who followed the Son of God (see D&amp;amp;C 29:36–39). This division has persisted throughout the history of mankind and will continue until the day of judgment when Jesus comes again in his glory. We read in Matthew that all nations will gather before him, and he will<br><br><i>Separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</i>[Matthew 25:32–34, 41]<br><br>The prophet Nephi tells us why many choose the wrong side of the line:<br><br><i>Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan had great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and the vain things of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 6:15]<br><br>The Lord has given us prophets to guide us and keep us from evil if we will accept and follow their instruction. The Lord would say to us today as he said to the ancient Israelites: "Be not afraid nor dismayed . . . ; for the battle is not yours, but God's . . . . the Lord will be with you. . . . Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established;<i>believe his prophets,</i>so shall ye prosper" (2 Chronicles 20:15, 17, 20; emphasis added).<br><br>In our conferences, we sustain the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. The Lord has appointed them as watchmen to warn the people (see Ezekiel 2:1–8) and as the "servant[s] of all" (D&amp;amp;C 50:26). He said: "Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>One latter-day prophet, President George Albert Smith, said:<br><br><i>The spirit of the adversary is the spirit of destruction. There are two influences in the world. The one is the influence of our Heavenly Father and the other is the influence of Satan. We can take our choice which territory we want to live in, that of our Heavenly Father or that of Satan.</i><br><br>President Smith then said, quoting his grandfather:<br><br><i>"There is a line of demarcation, well defined. On one side of the line is the Lord's territory. On the other side of the line is the devil's territory. . . .</i><i>If you will stay on the Lord's side of the line, you are perfectly safe, because the adversary of all righteousness cannot cross that line."</i><br><br><i>What does that mean? It means to me that those who are living righteous lives, keeping all of the commandments of our Heavenly Father are perfectly safe, but not those who trifle with his advice and counsel.</i>[<i>CR,</i>30 September 1949, pp. 5–6]<br><br>Other latter-day prophets have issued warnings, when inspired by the Lord, on such subjects as moral cleanliness, Sabbath observance, child and spouse abuse, homosexuality, abortion, and gambling. These statements are the word of the Lord through his prophets to help people avoid the pitfalls, sorrow, suffering, and misery of sin and error.<br><br>The statements of the prophets are not given to compel, coerce, dictate, control, or infringe on any person's right to choose. Church leaders are guided by the Lord's injunction in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42]<br><br>The prophets and other Church leaders never have misled the members on a principle of righteousness. Every principle is for our benefit. However, if we choose to ignore the prophets, we choose the consequences that follow. We have the God-given agency to either follow the prophets or not, but we cannot choose the consequences of exercising that agency. They will follow with absolute certainty. If we ignore the prophets, we become like the people the Savior chastised when he said: "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46).<br><br>In addition to the scriptures and the words of modern-day prophets, Latter-day Saints can discern clearly by the promptings of the Spirit the things they must do to be on the Lord's side.<br><br>To be on the Lord's side, we need to learn that true principles will lead us to peace and happiness in this world and to glory and exaltation in the world to come. We also need to learn that choosing the other side will only bring us problems, heartache, and sorrow. If we come too close to the line and tarry too long in the presence of evil, we are asking for trouble because we increase the likelihood that we might slip over the line into the territory of the adversary and become supporters of his cause instead of the Lord's.<br><br>We must be cautious of seemingly small thoughts and actions that can lead to large consequences. Just a little anger, unkindness, or disobedience; a dishonest deed; a few unclean thoughts or a little pornography; one experiment with drugs; a few lies, a little fraud; or a feeling of hate--all these can lead us into the camp of the adversary. Giving just an inch here and there can put us close enough to the line that one slip will take us right over it. Young people who decide to experiment with only one cigarette, one dose of drugs, or one drink of alcohol--only one--often find themselves addicted to a habit that controls them and that they can break only with great difficulty.<br><br>Men and women who decide to flirt with adultery just once can become enmeshed in misery and unhappiness for themselves and their precious families. Few are able to get back on the Lord's side immediately. Too many lose a loving companion, face separation from their children, develop bitterness, lose their economic stability, and lose their eternal blessings unless they repent. The Church has only one acceptable standard of sexual morality, and that is complete chastity for both sexes. I urge you to avoid situations that permit physical feelings to take control of behavior. The notion that you can endanger your physical and mental health by letting strong passions go unsatisfied is a vicious falsehood. Self-control is one mark of a mature person; it applies to control of language, physical treatment of others, and the appetites of the body.<br><br>The Lord said, "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8), and made Sabbath-day observance a sign between him and the people to indicate their obedience (Exodus 31:13–17). That commandment and sign have never been rescinded. In our day, standards for keeping the Sabbath day holy are lowered a little at a time by some individuals until practically anything seems to become acceptable. The sign between the Lord and his covenant people is trampled underfoot as Church members skip Sunday meetings to seek recreation at lakes and beaches, in the mountains, at sports arenas, and at theaters. Parking lots at supermarkets and discount stores often are full on Sundays. Many store owners feel compelled to open their doors on Sundays because of the demand for their merchandise and services. The people who misuse the Sabbath lose the blessings of spiritual food and growth promised to those who keep this commandment.<br><br>If we are to be on the Lord's side, we must be very careful of the entertainment we allow into our homes. Parents sometimes allow their children to see and hear things that are objectionable because they have more and more difficulty finding a movie, videotape, or television program that does not contain offensive elements. Rather than ban entertainment, parents tend to permit their children to watch a movie with violence or profanity or sexual content and hope their children will realize that Hollywood's standards do not reflect those of the parents. The difference between Hollywood's standards and those of most Americans is appalling, as shown in a 1991 study.<br><br><i>More than 100 top television writers and executives were asked questions that paralleled a poll taken of average American viewers. The results:</i><br><br><i>--A whopping 85 percent of the country believes adultery to be wrong. But in Hollywood, it's 49 percent.</i><br><br><i>--A minute 4 percent of the nation says it has no religious affiliation, compared to 45 percent in Hollywood.</i><br><br><i>--Some 76 percent of Americans feel</i>[homosexuality is]<i>wrong. In Hollywood, it's 20 percent.</i><br><br><i>--Abortion rights are supported by 59 percent of the country</i>[which is appalling]<i>compared to Hollywood's 97 percent.</i>[See Chris Hicks, "Hollywood's Values Clash with Our Own,"<i>Deseret News,</i>19 July 1992, p. E9]<br><br>Truly, parents and children will need to be diligent and cautious in choosing what type of entertainment to take into their homes.<br><br>Now is the time to show which side of the line we are on. Alma, the great prophet, said, "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God" (Alma 34:32). We may need courage to take a stand. We may be unpopular. We may have some groups and associates who disregard our standards and even scoff at our ideals and beliefs. The purpose of these groups is to destroy the freedom of the people, as stated succinctly in a recent newspaper editorial. They consider it unconstitutional for a child going to public school to carry a Bible, but a discussion of<i>Playboy</i>magazine is "freedom of expression."<br><br>Isn't it interesting that these groups consider it "freedom of expression" to profane the Lord's name and use obscenities, but oppose prayer in public places? These groups combat public faith yet uphold the right of anyone to have an abortion. They openly oppose good and love evil.<br><br>Being on the Lord's side means not only that we shun evil, but that we seek and cultivate the good wherever it can be found, whether within or without the Church. In a recent conference address, President Howard W. Hunter said:<br><br><i>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we seek to bring all truth together. We seek to enlarge the circle of love and understanding among all the people of the earth. Thus we strive to establish peace and happiness, not only within Christianity but among all mankind.</i><br><br><i>In the message of the gospel, the entire human race is one family descended from a single God. . . .</i><br><br>. . .<i>Every person is a spiritual child of God. In this gospel view there is no room for a contracted, narrow, or prejudicial view. . . .</i><br><br>. . .<i>There is no underlying excuse for smugness, arrogance, or pride. . . .</i><br><br><i>We believe there is a spiritual influence that emanates from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space. (See D&amp;amp;</i>C<i>88:12</i>.)<i>All men share an inheritance of divine light. God operates among his children in all nations, and those who seek God are entitled to further light and knowledge, regardless of their race, nationality, or cultural traditions.</i><br><br><i>Elder Orson F. Whitney .</i>. .<i>said: "[God] is using not only his covenant people, but other</i><br><br><i>peoples as well, to consummate a work, stupendous, magnificent, and altogether too arduous for this little handful of Saints to accomplish by and of themselves." (In CR, April 1921, p. 32.)</i>["The Gospel--A Global Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, pp. 18–19]<br><br>Recognizing this broad view of who can do good, we must be cautious that we do not confuse our opposition to wrongheaded ideas or dangerous practices with opposition to sincere, good-hearted people. Many good and honest people of different faiths or of no faith at all are on the Lord's side in seeking the betterment of their fellowmen and exerting a positive influence on society. Please consider with me a few examples of such good people.<br><br>A national magazine recently included a feature article about two brothers--not members of our Church, but with Utah roots--whose acts of kindness are on the Lord's side. They honor people who are committed to serving others. Since 1988, Val and Bill Halamandaris have given the National Caring Awards in Washington, D.C. Recipients have included both famous and obscure adults and young people, such as a former secretary of health, education, and welfare; a lifelong resident of Watts in the Los Angeles area who has single-handedly found housing for hundreds of homeless neighbors; a world-famous physician; and a Minneapolis housewife who began her own soup kitchen.<br><br>Successful in their business and government careers, the two brothers were "concerned with the materialism of the country and the tremendous amount of attention we were paying to celebrities. There are millions of people doing extraordinary things in this country, and nobody was honoring them."<br><br>The magazine article asks,<br><br><i>How did two brothers in their late 40s, with successful careers in Washington, come to devote so much of their lives to an ideal as abstract--and certainly unremunerative--as caring? As it turned out, the story began long ago.</i><br><br><i>"We're a couple of kids from Carbon County, Utah," Val explained. "After the railroads met at Promontory in 1869, they shipped a lot of the railroad workers--Chinese, Greeks, Italians--down to Carbon County to work in the coal mines. Our grandfather was a Greek immigrant who worked on the railroads. Our father was a miner. We grew up in a multicultural society where everybody was comfortable with everybody else, where we were constantly reminded of the goodness of people. We heard about the importance of doing things for others day in and day out." As Bill remembered: "When somebody needed something, you did what had to be done."</i><br><br><i>. . . "There is joy in transcending yourself to serve others."</i>[Michael Ryan, "Somebody Cares,"<i>Parade Magazine,</i>28 June 1992, pp. 24–27]<br><br>These brothers are good people who are honoring those who care for and serve others. Their efforts are the fruits of having learned in their youth to accept those who are different from themselves, not judging wrongly, but simply serving.<br><br>Others who are on the Lord's side are the gifted authors and composers whose inspired and sacred hymns convey deep spiritual messages in meetings of congregations in many parts of the world, enriching our Church and many others.<br><br>Just three months after the Church was organized in 1830, the Lord commanded Emma Smith, the Prophet Joseph's wife, to "make a selection of sacred hymns, . . . to be had in my church." The Lord said: "My soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads" (D&amp;amp;C 25:11–12).<br><br>In the preface of the LDS hymnal, the First Presidency wrote:<br><br><i>Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings.</i><br><br><i>The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns.</i>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, p. ix]<br><br>Faithful and devoted Christians who were not of our faith created many of our favorite and most inspiring hymns, including "How Great Thou Art," "I Need Thee Every Hour," "I Stand All Amazed ," "Because I Have Been Given Much," and "How Firm a Foundation."<br><br>In addition to strengthening church meetings spiritually, sacred hymns can help us control our thoughts, recognizing that our thoughts precede and lead to our actions. Elder Boyd K. Packer taught that we can replace unclean, improper, and degrading thoughts by focusing our attention on sacred music. Elder Packer suggested that we<br><br><i>choose from among the sacred music of the Church one favorite hymn. . . .</i><i>one with lyrics that are uplifting and the music reverent. Select one that, when it is properly rendered, makes you feel something akin to inspiration.</i><br><br><i>Now, go over it in your mind very thoughtfully a few times. Memorize the words and the music. Even though you have had no musical training, even though you do not play an instrument, and even though your voice may leave something to be desired, you can think through a hymn. I suspect you already have a favorite. . . .</i><i>you can only think of</i>one<i>thing at a time. Use this hymn as your emergency channel. Use this as the place for your thoughts to go. Anytime you find that.</i>. .<i>shady actors have slipped in from the sideline of your thinking onto the stage of your mind, think through this hymn. . . .</i><i>then you will begin to know something about controlling your thoughts. . . .</i>[This sacred music]<i>will change the whole mood on the stage of your mind. Because it is clean and uplifting and reverent, the baser thoughts will leave.</i>[Boyd K. Packer,<i>"That All May Be Edified"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), pp. 38–39]<br><br>The hymn "How Firm a Foundation," which is attributed to Robert Keen, an eighteenth-century member of a London Baptist church, was included in the first LDS hymnal, produced in 1835. This hymn served an extraordinary purpose in our early Church history. After the horrific massacre of seventeen Saints at Haun's Mill in 1838, the bereaved women and children survivors gathered at one of the homes. Among them was Amanda Smith, whose husband and one son had been killed, and whose other son had been wounded seriously. Gathering together "in our utter desolation," Amanda wrote later, "what could we women do but pray?" When prayer was forbidden by the militia--under the threat of death--Amanda slipped into a cornfield where "I prayed aloud and most fervently." In her own words,<br><br><i>"When I emerged from the corn a voice spoke to me. It was a voice as plain as I ever heard one. It was no silent, strong impression of the spirit, but a</i>voice,<i>repeating a verse of the saint's hymn"</i>["How Firm a Foundation"]:<br><br><i>That soul who on Jesus hath leaned for repose,</i><br><i>I cannot, I will not desert to its foes;</i><br><i>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</i><br><i>I'll never, no never, no never forsake!</i><br><br><i>"From that moment I had no more fear. I felt that nothing could hurt me. . . .</i><br><br>". . .<i>The soul who on Jesus had leaned for succor had not been forsaken even in this terrible hour of massacre."</i>[Edward W. Tullidge,<i>The Women of Mormondom</i>(New York, 1877), pp. 129–32]<br><br>We thank the Lord for the pure in heart who have left us their legacy of sacred hymns!<br><br>Our family has a personal interest in the massacre at Haun's Mill because Sister Wirthlin's great-grandfather, Joseph Young, was there. He had just arrived in Caldwell County, Missouri, from Kirtland, Ohio, when a small group of armed men told him he could proceed no further because he was a Mormon. He eluded the group and joined some of the Saints. He later saw the advancing mob of about 240 armed men fire into the mill where many of the Saints had taken refuge; he saw the robbing and looting. He fled to preserve his own life and then returned to help care for the wounded and bury the dead.<br><br>Most of us know of instances where the Church and its members have been persecuted, criticized, or misunderstood. But perhaps we are less aware of individuals and groups who have risen to defend the Church. One of the best known of such people is Colonel Thomas L. Kane, a Pennsylvania military officer whose influence assisted the Saints after their expulsion from Nauvoo and during their travails across Iowa and at Winter Quarters, the trek west to the Great Basin, and the early years in the Salt Lake valley. He traveled by sea from the East to the West Coast and then cross-country to Salt Lake City to help avert war and bloodshed as Johnson's army approached the Great Basin.<br><br>Long sympathetic to the Saints and their cause, Colonel Kane shared his feelings before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1850. In a lengthy discourse, he reviewed his acquaintance and association with Church members over several years, noting their suffering and endurance; their industry and enormous accomplishments while destitute; their order and discipline; their happy, cheerful natures; their devotion to their families, to each other, and to their God; their hope and faith in the future because of their religion; the injustice of their persecution; and their loyalty to the government that had turned its back to them. He closed his discourse by stating that he had never "heard the single charge against them as a community--against their habitual purity of life, their integrity of dealing, their toleration of religious differences in opinion, their regard for the laws, or their devotion to the constitutional government" that he did not know to be unfounded (see Thomas L. Kane, "The Mormons," in Daniel Tyler,<i>A Concise History of the Mormon Battalion in the Mexican War</i>[Salt Lake City, 1881], pp. 64–106).<br><br>Based on trust and the strength of personal conviction, Colonel Kane and the Saints forged friendships and genuine understanding that culminated in Brigham Young's designation of Colonel Kane as "our constant friend."<br><br>Less well known but equally courageous was Reverend Frederick Vining Fisher, pastor of the First Methodist Church in Ogden, Utah. In the early 1900s, Utah and the Church were the objects of considerable and often scurrilous articles in the print media. In 1911, a series of magazine articles attacked the Church for "polygamy, deception, bigotry, and the seeking of political power." Reverend Fisher felt inclined to respond.<br><br>Writing in a New York journal,<i>The Outlook,</i>he wrote that "with a personal knowledge of conditions twenty years ago, now, after some months of personal contact with that Church and its leaders . . . I am at least in as much a position to speak as magazine writers who have spent from two days to a month in the State seeking material to prove a predetermined prejudice." Writing that "Utah deserves some fair play at the hands of the press," Reverend Fisher described the Church as "half a million praying, Bible-reading, law-abiding, thrifty, God-fearing men and women. America has no more strong, genuine, devoted Christians than some of the First Presidency, apostles, and leaders of the Mormon Church."<br><br>To be sure, Reverend Fisher differed with the Church on points of doctrine and beliefs. But these differences caused no discord. What Utah needed, concluded Reverend Fisher, "is not a fight on Mormonism, but a common fight of Mormon and Methodist, Protest and Catholic, on sin; not bitterness, but brotherhood; . . . not a chasm between Gentile and Mormon, but a union of the strongest leaders of both types of Christianity on earth" (see Frederick Vining Fisher, "A Methodist Minister's View of Mormonism,"<i>The Outlook</i>, 29 July 1911, pp. 726–28).<br><br>I do not know why Reverend Fisher held such positive views of his Mormon neighbors, but we can be grateful for his courage in countering the articles that criticized Church members and leaders.<br><br>On the principle of contention among churches, the Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>If I esteem mankind to be in error, shall I bear them down? No. I will lift them up, and in their own way too, if I cannot persuade them my way is better; and I will not seek to compel any man to believe as I do, only by the force of reasoning, for truth will cut its own way. Do you believe in Jesus Christ and the Gospel of salvation which he revealed? So do I. Christians should cease wrangling and contending with each other, and cultivate the principles of union and friendship in their midst.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 313–14]<br><br>Joseph Smith also wrote: "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may (Articles of Faith 1:11).<br><br>In recent years the Anti-Defamation League and the National Conference of Christians and Jews have stood up for the Church. They have issued statements that have helped overcome misinformation circulated by critics of the Church. In the form of books and videotapes, this misinformation describes our beliefs inaccurately and unfairly and ridicules and treats lightly our most sacred principles and ordinances. We appreciate the modern "Colonel Kanes" for their goodwill and courage in being fair and honest. May we be found in the service of others that they may be able to say of us, "our constant friend."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, as member of communities, in seeking solutions to issues and concerns, we are best served by being tolerant of others' thinking and feelings--not a tolerance that becomes indifference, but a genuine tolerance that considers other views fairly and judges them on their merit, all the while maintaining a common civility. Quoting President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>There is too much intolerance in the world. There is too much of it in our own society . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We must not only be tolerant but we must cultivate a spirit of affirmative gratitude for those who do not see things quite as we see them. We do not in any way have to compromise our theology, our convictions, our knowledge of eternal truth, as it has been revealed by the God of Heaven. We can offer our won witness of the truth, . . . but never in a manner that will give offense to others.</i>["Out of Your Experience Here," BYU 1990–91<i>Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1991), p. 30]<br><br>As I come to the close of my remarks, I express my love for you and my earnest hope that you always will be on the Lord's side of truth and righteousness. I admonish you to follow the prophets, to heed their counsel and give your attention to their warnings. All they say and do is for your benefit. Be grateful for the good that people do everywhere, whether to serve society generally or in behalf of the Church. Always be tolerant and considerate of the views and beliefs of others, recognizing each one as a son or daughter of God.<br><br>I bear my humble witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. This is his church; he directs it through his prophets, beginning with Joseph Smith in these latter days and continuing to our present prophet, Ezra Taft Benson. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B. Wirthlin was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 August 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>haustible Gospel - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I give my sincere appreciation to President Lee and to those who have planned these important days for you and for this opportunity to be with you, brothers and sisters. My appreciation goes to Michael Ballam for the beautiful music and, just as important, for the quality of his and his wife's personal discipleship.<br><br>The title of my address, "The Inexhaustible Gospel," is intended to convey the vastness and preciousness of that enormous body of knowledge we call the gospel and--if I am at all successful--some of my ever-growing excitement over it.<br><br>Before using terms like<i>truth, knowledge, intelligence, education,</i>and<i>wisdom,</i>I stress at the outset that the scriptural definitions of these terms give us, as Latter-day Saints, an added understanding of these concepts. They differ from those of the world--markedly, in fact. Each is "added upon" by the relevant revelations. These differences are especially worth noting during an Education Week. Please be patient while I attempt to note certain of these distinctions.<br><br>For example, our being saved by gaining knowledge obviously refers to a particular form of knowledge, a "knowledge of God" and knowledge of the things of God (see D&amp;amp;C 128:19;<i>Teachings,</i>p. 217). Nephi lamented, as you know, over those who "will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge" (2 Nephi 32:7). Clearly he was referring to a particular kind of knowledge. In fact, Joseph Smith's translation of Jesus' lamentation--about how those in his time had lost the "key of knowledge"--provides a definition; it adds five words defining what the word<i>key</i>means: "the fulness of the scriptures" (JST, Luke 11:53; see also D&amp;amp;C 84:19–20). So we view knowledge differently. Furthermore, Latter-day Saints know that certain knowledge comes only by revelation and, thereby, is only "spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14). So we are in some important respects on a different footing from the people of the world.<br><br>In addition, brothers and sisters, multiple scriptures make it clear that<i>knowledge</i>is meant to be closely associated with other virtues such as patience, humility, charity, and kindness (D&amp;amp;C 4:6; 107:30–31; 121:41–42; 2 Peter 1:5–9).<br><br><i>Truth</i>includes, but is not limited to, knowledge that corresponds to reality--things as they were, things as they are, and things as they will be (Jacob 4:13; D&amp;amp;C 93:24). Gospel truth is "morally richer," therefore, than the world's definition of truth, as Terry Warner has written<i>(Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 4 [New York: Macmillan Co., 1992], p. 1490). Jesus is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). He has "received a fulness of truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:26). Hence, we are to seek to have "the mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16). Furthermore, as to the "manner" of people we are to become, it is clear we are to strive to become "even as" Jesus is (3 Nephi 27:27; see also 2 Peter 3:11). If we keep the commandments, the promise is that we will receive "truth and light" until we are "glorified in truth and knoweth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 93:28).<br><br>Therefore, gaining knowledge and becoming more Christlike "are two aspects of a single process" (Warner,<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 4, p. 1490). This process is part of being "valiant" in our testimony of Jesus. Thus, while we are saved no faster than we gain a certain type of knowledge, it is also the case, as Richard Bushman has observed, that we will gain knowledge no faster than we are saved (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 217). So we have a fundamentally different understanding of knowledge and truth--behaving and knowing are inseparably linked.<br><br>So defined, the gospel is inexhaustible because there is not only so much to know, but also so much to become! The vital truths are not merely accumulated in the mind but are expressed in life as well.<br><br><i>Intelligence</i>is "the glory of God," as we all know. It is defined as "light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). The revelations also inform us that if we have "more knowledge<i>and</i>intelligence in this life," we will have "so much the advantage in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19). I do not pretend to be able to be definitive with regard to this last verse, but, clearly, what we carry forward, brothers and sisters, involves developing our capacity for cognition as well as application. This sets us apart from the world. I hope we understand some of the implications of all these things. Certainly, what we will carry forward is more than what we now term as<i>IQ</i>or<i>databases.</i>It is the entire being of the individual. Hence our approach to knowledge, truth, and wisdom is markedly different.<br><br>What are some of the implications of the foregoing?<br><br>First, some of us--and I include myself--sometimes casually speak of education for eternity. Brothers and sisters, it is clear from the verses of scripture that some truths may turn out to have a place in a yet-to-be-revealed hierarchy of truth that the world doesn't understand. The scriptures tantalize us by saying, "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it" (D&amp;amp;C 93:30). One even wonders if truths, like planets, belong to a particular order (see Abraham 3:9). But we do not now know.<br><br>The highest education, therefore, includes salvational truths, bringing us a knowledge of "things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). This focus can be achieved without leaving the usual educational chores "undone" (Matthew 23:23). Scholars like the president of Brigham Young University, Rex Lee, have surely demonstrated this.<br><br>Ultimate orthodoxy--and orthodoxy isn't a popular word nowadays--is expressed in the Christlike life that involves both mind and behavior. Christ's manner of life is truly "the way, the truth, and the life," and he has directed us to pursue his example (John 14:6; see also Matthew 5:48; 3 Nephi 12:48; 3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>Another important implication of what we have been discussing is that all knowledge is not of equal significance. There is no democracy of facts! They are not of equal importance. Something might be factual but unimportant, as Elder Spencer Condie has observed. For instance, today I wear a dark blue suit. That is true, but it is unimportant. The world does not quite understand this. As we brush against truth, we sense that it has a hierarchy of importance. We are dealing with some things of<i>transcending</i>importance. Some truths are salvationally significant, and others are not.<br><br>Another important insight is that knowledge is intended to travel in a convoy of other Christian virtues. It does not have final meaning by itself. If one possesses some knowledge, as Peter said, but "lacketh" these other qualities, he cannot "see afar off' (2 Peter 1:5–9). A most interesting concept! Precious perspective is missing unless knowledge is accompanied by these other truths.<br><br>Other insights bear down upon us as Latter-day Saints. Brilliance, by itself, is not wholeness, nor happiness. Knowledge, if possessed for its own sake and unapplied, leaves one's life unadorned. A Church member, for instance, might describe the Lord's doctrines but not qualify to enter the Lord's house. One could produce much brilliant commentary without being exemplary. One might be intellectually brilliant but Bohemian in behavior. One might use his knowledge to seek preeminence or dominion.<br><br>Such are not Jesus' ways, for he asks that perception and implementation be part of the same spiritual process. In Alma's words, we are to "give place" in our lives for the good seed of the gospel to grow--which involves a form of knowing that combines cognition as well as implementation (see Alma 32).<br><br>As we all know, Christ does not dominate by his intellect. He leads by example and love. There is no arrogance flowing from his, the keenest of all intellects. He seeks neither to conquer nor to prosper "according to his genius" (see Alma 30:17).<br><br>Given these foregoing views of restoration theology as they pertain to knowledge, truth, education, and wisdom, there is, finally, no comfort zone for vanity or hypocrisy. There is no sanctuary for them.<br><br>Clearly, in such a situation as I have attempted to describe altogether too briefly, a few individuals in the Church end up "looking beyond the mark," missing the already obvious (Jacob 4:14). These few individuals let their minds seek to run far ahead of their confirming behavior. For them, exciting exploration is preferred to plodding implementation. Speculation and argumentation are more fun than consecration for these individuals. Some even try to soften the hard doctrines. What happens, however, is that by their not obeying, they lack knowing, as we are discussing knowing today. Thus, since they cannot defend the faith, a few of them become critics instead of defenders (John 7:17).<br><br>As far as salvational truths are concerned, therefore, the secular knowledge explosion in recent years--with all of its many and unarguable benefits to mankind--has not been a bang at all. It has been merely a whimper. It was the Restoration that provided the explosion of salvational knowledge.<br><br>I now hasten to add, having said these preliminary things, that the role of secular knowledge is very important. Latter-day Saints should have all the genuine excitement others have in the traditional adventure of learning, including learning secular truths--and we, of all people, should have a little more! In fact, when we are so learning and so behaving, we are truly "about [our] Father's business." This should bring to us a special and genuine zest for learning (see 2 Nephi 9:29; Luke 2:49).<br><br>Furthermore, those of us who have spent much of our lives involved with traditional education regard it as one of mankind's most useful, productive, and cost-beneficial enterprises. It is even more beneficial, however, when it has the spiritual dimension added to it. Secular education wisely does not pretend to give us answers to the great "why" questions--any more than you and I, brothers and sisters, would read a telephone directory in search of a plot!<br><br>Our different frame of reference should never cause us to preen or to be insensitive to the uncertainty or despair some feel in the world precisely because they believe sincerely that man exists in "godless, geometric space."<br><br>I have always had a special appreciation for my friends who, though resolutely irreligious themselves, were not scoffers. Instead, though doubtless puzzled by me and their other religious friends, they were nevertheless respectful. I admire the day-to-day decency of such men and women. Though detached from theology, their decency is commendable.<br><br>I now share a lamentation from one character in a story that illustrates the confusion, despair, and pain felt by many. He says,<br><br><i>Are all men's lives . . . broken, tumultuous, agonized and unromantic. . . . Who knows? . . . I don't know. Why can't people have what they want? The things were all there to content everybody, yet everybody got the wrong thing. . . . It's beyond me. It's all darkness.</i>[PBS production of "The Good Soldier," by Ford Madox Ford, viewed in early 1983]<br><br>As if speaking to this very point, the Prophet Joseph Smith observed,<br><br><i>Knowledge does away with darkness, suspense and doubt; for these cannot exist where knowledge is.</i><br><br><i>There is no pain so awful as that of suspense</i>. [<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 287–88]<br><br>Joseph, of course, was speaking about a particular kind of knowledge.<br><br>Thus our view of education is the same as that Jesus prescribed with regard to our other Christian duties: namely, the weightier matters should receive their deserved prominence without leaving the lesser learning chores "undone" (Matthew 23:23).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph also observed, "If you wish to go where God is, you must be like God, or possess the principles which God possesses" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 216). God possesses perfect knowledge, but he also possesses perfect love and mercy. What a contrast he is to those mortals who are bright but bad, who are clever but carnal! Even genius without goodness can be dangerous.<br><br>No wonder, therefore, "to be learned is good if [we] hearken unto the counsels of God" instead of setting them aside as if we have somehow outgrown them (2 Nephi 9:29). How can one ever outgrow Christ's example of knowing, behaving, and doing? What happens, however, is that some easily fall into the trap described by Paul, "Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7). One might learn a great deal about the physical characteristics of this planet earth but yet be ignorant of<i>why</i>it was created in the first place (see Isaiah 45:18; 1 Nephi 17:36; Moses 1:33,39).<br><br>Certainly during Education Week we need to know the plan for the week, what the presentations are, in which room, and at what time. Such information, for the moment, is essential. But compare having that information to knowing the truth about God's plan of salvation!<br><br>For mortals, therefore, the gospel is inexhaustible, because "the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God" (1 Corinthians 2:10). Jacob's words are strikingly similar to Paul's: "For the Spirit speaketh the truth . . . of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). Unsurprisingly, the scriptural definition of truth matches. It is the "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). What vastness!<br><br>While encountering and exploring such vastness, we sometimes know more than our tongues can tell. Indeed, knowledge that is "spiritually discerned" is not always easily communicated. But the ultimate place we hope to be in is one where "in the presence of God, . . . all things . . . are manifest, past, present, and future, and are continually before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 130:7). What a wondrous God we worship! The Prophet Joseph Smith said "the past, the present, and the future were and are, with [Jehovah], one eternal 'now'" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 220). How different the Lord's "now" is from ours!<br><br>In exploring this comprehensiveness and everlastingness, there will be some surprises. Our understanding of some things will be restructured and expanded, especially in the world to come, for "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). In eternity, when the faithful receive "all that [the] Father hath," this will include an enormous enlargement intellectually (D&amp;amp;C 84:38).<br><br>However, some divine disclosure can begin even now in mortality:<br><br><i>For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:10]<br><br>Having been given so many marvelous truths, we are to share them in order that "wise men and rulers may hear and know that which they have never considered" (D&amp;amp;C 101:94; see also 3 Nephi 20:45, 21:8). So much of the gospel we bring is what people have "never considered."<br><br>Quite understandably, given its very nature, God's latter-day work will be regarded with much skepticism by many. The Lord foresaw this, saying he would "bring to pass my act, my strange act, and perform my work, my strange work, that men may discern" (D&amp;amp;C 101:95; see also Isaiah 28:21; 29:14, Moffat version).<br><br>By accessing the inexhaustible divine data bank--through meekness and righteousness, thereby utilizing the Spirit, scriptures, and prophets--special wisdom is opened to us as the Spirit teaches us of "things as they really are, and of things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). President Brigham Young, who had his share of spiritual experiences, said, "When the voice of the Good Shepherd is heard, the honest in heart believe and receive it. It is good to taste with the inward taste, to see with the inward eyes" (<i>JD</i>8:42).<br><br>In God's "strange work," his ways of informing mankind are likewise unusual:<br><br><i>Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.</i><br><br><i>And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world.</i>[Alma 12:29–30]<br><br>Ironically, many refuse to examine gospel truths simply because of<i>how</i>God reveals them. These very methods swell skepticism among many. Furthermore, these divine disclosures are not democratically dispensed because such things are "made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works" (Alma 12:30; see also 2 Nephi 1:10).<br><br>However, when people are left alone--without angelic visitations, without divine disclosures, without prophets, without scriptures, without the Spirit--many cease believing. Belief in the basics is the first thing to go, as happened with Book of Mormon peoples who ceased believing in God, in the resurrection, and in a redeeming Christ (Omni 1:17; Mosiah 26:2).<br><br>Many in the world hold back from making the "leap of faith" because they have already jumped to some other conclusions--often the Korihor conclusions, which are: God never was nor ever will be; there is no redeeming Christ; man cannot know the future; man cannot know of that which he cannot see; whatsoever a man does is no crime; and death is the end (see Alma 30:13–18). The number of adherents to the Korihor conclusions will grow.<br><br>When so positioned, many mortals do not accept the fulness of the gospel. Their reactions to the gospel range from indifference to contempt. Happily, there are some who are meek enough to consider that which they have "never considered" and "never had supposed" (D&amp;amp;C 101:94; Moses 1:10).<br><br>When Moses was schooled by the Egyptians, what he learned there did not compare in eternal significance to what he learned from God's revelations, things he said he "never had supposed" (Acts 7:22; Moses 1:10–33).<br><br>The great "who," "what," and "why" questions are those on which the transcending revelations focus. "What," for instance, is God doing?<br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i>[Moses 1:39]<br><br>"Who" is involved?<br><br><i>By him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:24]<br><br>God's revelations do not usually give us answers to the "how" and "when" questions, such as details concerning the creation of the earth. Yes, there are revelations such as that on the building of Noah's ark--a revelation not reusable, by the way--and on other tactical matters, but the recurring themes of the revelations are spiritual.<br><br>Thus the Creator of the Universe does not choose to dazzle his audiences with data concerning the Creation. Rather, as a Perfect and Loving Shepherd, he is interested in the central needs and concerns of his sheep in his many folds.<br><br>These revealed truths carry behavioral as well as intellectual responsibilities. When informed, we are accountable. Solomon, for instance, was widely celebrated for his wisdom (1 Kings 10:1, 6–7). Impressively wise as Solomon doubtless was in many respects, he was not wise enough to keep all God's commandments (see 1 Kings 11:1–14).<br><br>Individuals are often otherwise commendable, as was Morianton, who "did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself because of his many whoredoms" (Ether 10:11). In gospel wisdom, knowing and behaving are irrevocably linked!<br><br>One basic limitation of worldly wisdom is its lack of longitudinality and of precious perspective. Worldly wisdom cannot "see afar off," and, without a spiritual memory, past mistakes are repeated; folly is resumed! Winston Churchill chose, by the way, as the motto for his last volume of World War II history these words:<br><br><i>How the Great Democracies Triumphed, and so Were able to Resume the Follies Which Had so Nearly Cost Them Their Life.</i>[Winston S. Churchill,<i>The Second World War,</i>vol. 6,<i>Triumph and Tragedy</i>(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1953), p. ix]<br><br>The world in its search for physical security, for instance, tends to build Maginot Lines while naively neglecting its northern flank. It seeks to control the diseases flowing from sexual immorality but without honoring the principles of fidelity and chastity. The world in its wisdom constantly seeks to accommodate the natural man while gospel wisdom constantly urges us to put off the natural man (Mosiah 3:19). This is a pivotal point, and it makes all the difference!<br><br>Being so immersed in the gospel framework, we sometimes fail to realize how illuminating gospel truths are with regard to so many issues of the day. For instance, given the plan of salvation with our need to experience this mortal school, to acquire a mortal body, and then knowing the very preciousness of human life--we see the awful practice of widespread abortion differently. Similarly, struggling to have the "mind of Christ" includes purity of thought and letting virtue garnish our thoughts unceasingly. Hence we view pornography as an awful and enslaving thing. We cannot feel otherwise concerning such practices as abortion and pornography, even if practices such as abortion and pornography are legally and constitutionally protected.<br><br>This is not to say we expect others to share our views or even to understand them. Some will not even tolerate our views but, instead, attempt to shame us. If we really are "saints of the Holy One," we will endure the "crosses of the world," and despise "the shame of it" (2 Nephi 9:18). Whether it is worldly shame or worldly temptations, like Jesus, we should give "no heed unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 20:22; see also Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>Salvational truths combine longevity and relevancy; they contain both span and significance! Education that is only "for a season" is narrow; it pertains only to a knowledge of things as they temporarily are, like today's weather forecast or an airline schedule. Temporary facts are useful but terminal. Jesus noted the intensity of the children of this world, but said their operative framework was only "in their generation" (see Luke 16:8).<br><br>Given such significant gradations among knowledge, we can resonate to T. S. Eliot's lamentation: "Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?" (T. S. Eliot,<i>The Rock</i>[1934], I).<br><br>Thus our consuming of certain information is like consuming our daily bread. We need it, but it is perishable. We will soon hunger again (see John 6:47–48, 51). Instead, the bread of life is inexhaustible!<br><br>Ultimate wisdom enables us to see Jesus as the Light of the World, but, further, we also come to realize that it is by his light that we are to see everything else! The gospel's bright and illuminating light thereby helps us see God, ourselves, others, the world, and the universe more correctly and more deeply. Indeed, as Paul declared, "in [Christ] all things hold together" (RSV, Colossians 1:17).<br><br>For now, though we can mercifully see something of our eventual possibilities, you and I are aware of our present limitations. Tolkien wrote wisely:<br><br><i>It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.</i>[Gandalf in J. R. R. Tolkien,<i>The Return of the King</i>(New York: Ballantine Books, 1965), p. 190]<br><br>Hence we desperately need the gospel's wisdom not only for eternity, but also "for the succour of those years wherein we are set," in order "to do what is in us." Enoch obtained revelation and reassurance and gratefully exclaimed of God, "Yet thou art there" (Moses 7:30). This is what you and I want to know of him: Does he know me, love me, and care for me? We can have the same reassurance given to Enoch.<br><br>How intellectually amazing the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is! The gospel is truly inexhaustible! It is marvelous! It is a wonder!<br><br>Yet orthodoxy is required to keep all these truths in essential balance. In orthodoxy lies real safety and real felicity! Flowing from orthodoxy is not only correctness but happiness. Orthodoxy is especially vital in a time of raging relativism and belching sensualism. The world's morality is constantly being improvised. Some views are politically correct one day, but not another.<br><br>One writer recently observed that the relativistic forces at work<br><br><i>should warm every atheist's heart. For if God is a socially conscious political being whose views invariably correspond to our own prejudices on every essential point of doctrine, he demands of</i><br><br><i>us no more than our politics require.</i>[H]<i>ow would our worship of</i>[this kind of being]<i>constitute more than self-congratulation for our own moral standards?</i><br><br>The writer continued:<br><br><i>As an atheist, I like this God. It is good to see him every morning while I am shaving.</i>[Eugene D. Genovese, "Pilgrim's Progress,"<i>The New Republic,</i>11 May 1992, p. 38]<br><br>Yes, being learned is good! It can supply us with the needed facts and help us develop a facility with facts and a discernment among facts. It can train us to use our minds, to cultivate an intellectual adroitness in connecting various patches of truth and insight. It certainly furthers the calisthenics of the intellect.<br><br>Finally, however, you and I should be fully qualified and certified in traditional education and its processes for yet another very good reason: bilinguality. The men and women of Christ should be truly educated and articulate as to secular knowledge but should also be educated and articulate in the things of the Spirit!<br><br>I close now by speaking further of Jesus, our Perfect Shepherd. His atoning experience placed upon him the sicknesses, sorrows, griefs, and pains of the human experience in order "that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:11, 12; see also 2 Nephi 9:21; Isaiah 53:4–5; Hebrews 2:18). He "suffered the pain of all men," women, and children and was "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (D&amp;amp;C 18:11; Hebrews 4:15). Thus, in the agony of the Atonement, Jesus "descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things" (see D&amp;amp;C 88:6; see also D&amp;amp;C 122:8). How marvelous the "mind of Christ," which we are to try to come to have (1 Corinthians 2:16).<br><br>Jesus, our Perfect Exemplar, was astonishingly exemplary even in the hours surrounding the awful but glorious Atonement. The intrigue of Pilate and Herod, for instance, who had earlier been "at enmity" but who "made friends together" because of Jesus, presented opportunities for Jesus to "shrink" from going through with the Atonement (Luke 23:12; D&amp;amp;C 19:18). Herod, who had been desirous "to see [Jesus] of a long season," "hoped to have seen some miracle done by him" (Luke 23:8). Yet Jesus, under heavy questioning from Herod, "answered him nothing" (Luke 23:9; see also Mosiah 14:7). Jesus' integrity and intellect were not for sale! Amid temptation, he maintained his integrity--even in the midst of an opportunity that a lesser individual would have seized to reduce his suffering and to increase the praise of men.<br><br>Ironically, when Jesus' enemies came for him, the Light of the World, they came with lanterns and torches (John 18:3). Jesus, who by then might have understandably been so swollen with sorrow and self-concern that there was no time to think of others, nevertheless restored the severed ear of a hostile guard (Luke 22:50–51). Amid irony he kept his poise. He also kept his way, which is not the way of the sword.<br><br>Christ spoke only several sentences on the cross. One of them was to insure that his mother, Mary, would be cared for by John (John 19:25–27). Another sentence reassured a thief on an adjoining cross (Luke 23:43). He had empathy amid his agony.<br><br>Finally, he maintained his consecration in the midst of the deepest deprivation anyone can know. President Brigham Young taught us that in the course of the astonishing Atonement, the Father withdrew both his presence and his Spirit from Jesus, and, further, even cast a veil over Jesus (<i>JD</i>3:206). Thus Jesus became utterly and totally alone! There then came that great cry of forsakenness! "Nevertheless," Jesus did not "shrink," but, instead, "finished [his] preparations unto the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 19:18–19). Just as he promised premortally, even when he might have reflected a little credit upon himself for the glorious Atonement, meek Jesus, instead, gave all the glory to the Father (D&amp;amp;C 19:19).<br><br>We need not apologize for regarding Jesus as "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). We need not apologize for regarding salvational knowledge, revealed by him, as being the most precious. Indeed, in Christ "all things hold together," for he is perfect in knowing and perfect in doing. And, most marvelously, he has challenged us to become like him (Matthew 5:48; 3 Nephi 12:48; 27:27).<br><br>Of him, I testify! Of his standard of truth and knowledge and behavior, I testify! He is the Light of the World! May we reflect his light in our lives, distinguishing between the things of the moment--including the facts that dissolve--and the supernal, transcending knowledge of spiritual things, the great blessing he has given us through the restored gospel. This is my humble, heartfelt prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1> BYU: Shared Values, Challenges, Opportunities - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Let me begin with a couple of personal observations. The first concerns my health. I get enough inquiries from time to time that I know many of you are interested. I appreciate that interest. As confirmed by my principal oncologist in my most recent visit last month, my health is as good right now as it has been in several years. I am grateful to my Heavenly Father and to my wife and my doctors for this favorable circumstance--and grateful to so many of you for the prayers that have been offered in my behalf.<br><br>Now the other personal report concerns my effort over the past year to improve my humility. I've had a couple of recent experiences that have greatly contributed to that effort, and I need to report them to you.<br><br>Two or three months ago I bought a bolt-end of material suitable for making suits. When I took it to a local tailor, he informed me that there was simply not enough in that bolt-end to make a suit that would fit me. Later that day, when I was in Salt Lake, I happened to drive by another tailor's shop and decided to get a second opinion. To my astonishment, I was told: "Oh, sure. I can make you a suit from that fabric and, if you like, a second pair of pants and a vest." I expressed my surprise and told him of my other conversation earlier in the day. He replied, "Well, you've just got to remember one thing. You're not nearly as big a man in Salt Lake as you are in Provo."<br><br>Some of you may conclude that I've taken a slight bit of license with that first story, but I assure you that this second one occurred exactly as I tell it. At last spring's Blue/White football game, I noticed that one of the freshman running backs was from Eagar, Arizona, a neighboring town to the one in which I grew up. After the game was over, I went down to the field, sought him out, and said, "I understand you're from Eagar. That's interesting, because I'm from St. John's." His response was, "Oh yeah, and who are you?"<br><br>Over the course of a year I give a lot of talks. It would be difficult to rank most of them in importance, but one is clearly in a class by itself. I consider it the most important talk I give each year--both from the standpoint of the setting and the substance, and also the amount of agonizing that I invest in it. It is this one: the address that I give to the faculty and staff each year in August. This is my annual opportunity to share with you, my fellow toilers in the BYU vineyard, my reflections on where we are, where we are going, and what challenges and obstacles we need to overcome in order to get there.<br><br>In my opinion, Brigham Young University is basically sound. Sound philosophically, educationally, financially, and in the dedicated spirit that the great majority of its people have toward the institution, toward its sponsoring Church, and toward our own particular individual responsibilities. Surely, in these areas as in all others, there is room for improvement. But any visit to another university campus--and any review of the financial and relational problems that beset so many American universities--leads me to count my blessings that I am here and not somewhere else.<br><br>The past year has been one of the most interesting and rewarding that I have ever spent, and I am grateful to have been part of what has happened at BYU during the 1991–92 school year. Most prominent among the highlights, in my view, were the drafting and finalization of several core documents, such as our statement on academic freedom and our standards for promotion and tenure. Other highlights have included the dedication of our new Joseph Smith Building; the completion of the language residence halls; the work of our long-range planning committee, which, as our provost has explained, will continue, with a focus this year on long-range planning at the college and departmental levels; four Olympic medals won by BYU people, including two silver by Frank Fredericks; the launching of the Honor Code Council, composed totally of students, who are providing education and leadership to the students and support for the faculty in implementing the Code; 10 Western Athletic Conference championships; and many others. To be sure, if I had the year to do over again, there are some things I would change, but I repeat: On the whole, it has been one of the most satisfying years of my life. Across the entire campus, the past year has been marked by positive signs of progress, improvement, and accomplishment. This is a place where we teach and learn and think and create, a place where we build souls and minds, and over the past 12 months we have, on balance, done it quite well.<br><br>The coming year promises to be even more interesting. The dedication of our new fine arts museum will bring to our university and our community some of the finest cultural opportunities in the Intermountain West. I am something of a latecomer to the joys of art museums. I discovered my fascination for them just 17 years ago. But I am a true convert and, with you, I look forward to the enrichment that this new museum will provide for us and others. Both its construction and also its operating costs come from donated funds, and I express my gratitude and admiration to our many generous donors, to Dean James Mason for his tireless and successful efforts, and to our LDS Foundation and BYU Development staffs who, incidentally, through their effort and yours, are just completing the most successful fund-raising year that BYU has ever had.<br><br>I believe that over the past 20 years or more the quality of our faculty--and therefore the quality of our teaching, scholarly, and creative work--has steadily increased. The same is also true of our support staff, and I want to take this opportunity, on behalf of the faculty and the administration, to express our profound gratitude to those dedicated workers at BYU who keep our buildings clean, mow our lawns, cook our meals, provide our housing services, run our bookstore, type our letters, answer our phones, and in every other way provide the support services essential to our academic mission. Without those services, this or any other university could not function. Without the quality of those services that we enjoy, our university could not function at its present levels. And so to all of you, I say thank you. We will now be pleased to view a photographic thank you to the many "behind the scenes" people whose contributions never go unnoticed and need to be publicly recognized.<br><br>[Multimedia Presentation]<br><br>Our most important objective for this year is the same as it has been for every year of our existence. There are lots of ways to put it, from Brigham Young's instruction to Karl G. Maeser to teach not even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the spirit of God, to the Doctrine and Covenants' mandate that we acquire learning by study and also by faith.<br><br>BYU is unique among American universities because it incorporates the restored gospel as an integral part of its academic program. It is also true that both our uniqueness and also our effectiveness are enhanced to the extent that we use the Restoration to inform what we do academically. We firmly reject the notion that we must choose between being either a high-class university or a seminary. We don't just become a great university and incidentally, as a sidelight, maintain our spiritual heritage. Our great strength is in the mutual support that each of these derives from the other.<br><br>May I share with you the following journal entry from one of Jae Ballif's students last spring semester reflecting on the impact that Bob Speiser has had on her life:<br><br>"My professor, Dr. Speiser, has a great love for the logic and exactness of geometry. His enthusiasm has really opened my mind in a way that has changed the way I think. After a particularly intense discussion on angles, half-planes, and space, he paused to share some of his thoughts on the beauty of this subject and how it describes our world. He is not a member of the Church, but he quoted from our Doctrine and Covenants, Section 88:45–47, which reads: 'The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God. Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand? Behold all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any of the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.' Somehow, studying perhaps 'the least of these' in the beautiful theorems of geometry, I felt that I could see the majesty of God's creations."<br><br>Thank you Jae Ballif, thank you Bob Speiser, and thanks to the student, whoever you are, who wrote that beautiful paragraph capturing a magnificent example of what we are all about at BYU.<br><br>Over the three years that I have held my present position, I have noticed a steady improvement in our willingness to be quite open about our uniqueness. We see it more and more as a strength, as an important pillar in our larger academic endeavors. I think one of the reasons for this is that we are becoming good enough academically, measured by the standards that the world uses, that others not only see our good works, they also respect us for the fact that, at this place, the entire package of those good works is a bit larger and has more dimensions than at other schools. It is neither needful nor expected that we do all things the same as other universities. Our uniqueness, tied to the Restoration, is our great strength, and this uniqueness is our contribution to American higher education. Because of us, America's colleges and universities, taken as a whole, are more interesting and more diverse.<br><br>Last winter semester I started a practice that I will probably continue this year of periodically having lunch with some of our students, selected on a first-come, first-served basis. They were non-agenda lunches at which I simply asked the students to tell me what was on their minds. The one comment that clearly dominated was a desire that we make a greater effort to incorporate values--solid, hard-core, gospel-related religious values--into our academic program. I am generally optimistic about our trend in this respect. But we still have a long way to go. We don't hide behind our scholarship any more than we hide behind our religion. The relationship between the two is not antagonistic, it is synergistic. We don't justify incompetence because of religion, and neither do we justify secularity because of academic excellence.<br><br>The recent suggestion that the only thing the Church can do with BYU is to sell it--because the purpose of universities is to challenge established postulates, whereas religious organizations exist for entirely different and inconsistent purposes--is borderline nonsense. Its basic defect is that it proves too much because it would necessarily apply not only to religious institutions, but also to religious persons. Followed through to its conclusion, the argument that religious universities are doomed to failure because the work of the academy--in contrast to that of religious entities--is rational and skeptical would mean that no person who is serious about his or her religious beliefs could ever make it as a university professor. In other words, it's too bad that people such as James E. Talmage, Harvey Fletcher, and Henry Eyring were so hung up on their religion, because but for that fact they could have been successful teachers and scholars. The same point applies to hundreds of people in this audience.<br><br>My own profession is one which rests solidly on the foundation stones of skepticism and challenge to existing postulates. I have experienced neither impediment nor discomfort in this fact because I have come to understand that there are some areas in which skepticism is important and others in which it is inappropriate. Nothing in my religion requires me to abhor all skepticism, and nothing in my professional life requires me to be a skeptic in all things. My approach to what I do in the temple is different in some ways from my approach to what I do in the Supreme Court. Both are very important to me, and over the decades that I have been involved in both, I have found no incompatibility between the two. Indeed, properly understood, they are mutually supportive, and their compatibility ultimately ties back to the scriptural injunction that I hope is the lodestar for all of us: "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<br><br>I want to say something about our continuing need to be concerned about the level of compassion, empathy, and care that we show not only for our students, but for all persons with whom we come in contact in any kind of university-related way. This is an issue that affects all of us. In some respects it affects the staff more and in some ways the faculty are more crucially involved, but none is unaffected. At bottom, what I am asking for is nothing more than a continuing application by every person who works here of foundational golden-rule principles.<br><br>I think that by and large we do an amazingly good job of remembering that the various people with whom we deal--students, applicants for admission, family members of students and applicants, tithe payers, employers of our graduates, and all visitors to our campus--are real, living, individual human beings and not just abstract numbers. They have feelings, and those feelings can be hurt. It is very easy for any of us to slip into the mind-set of the monopolist: Because we have a larger number of highly qualified applicants than we can accept, we can afford the monopolist's extravagance and cut back on the quality of our service.<br><br>The place where this issue is probably the touchiest is in our Admissions Office, as our admissions people know so well. But it also reaches into every corner of what we do. If you work in the Registrar's Office, or Food Services, or Housing, or University Police, or you teach or advise students, or you work with our performing groups, or you answer the phones, or you are the president of the university, or you just happened to be on campus when a question is asked: Every one of us, every hour of every day, is necessarily a BYU ambassador. At times this may seem unfair, but the entire university may be judged for good or ill based on what you do and say to people with whom you come in contact. Constantly, I see examples of this: appreciation for extra-mile courtesies and thoughtful acts and disappointment and even bitterness where such qualities are lacking, or where they are perceived to be lacking.<br><br>Civility ought also to be our watchword in our dealings with each other. Things happen periodically that remind us of our continuing need to be sensitive and respectful in matters pertaining to gender and other types of discriminatory conduct and expression. This issue generally is one that is receiving a great deal of attention in many corners of our society. And properly so. It is an issue that needs attention. Earlier this month I participated in the annual judicial conference of our nation's largest federal circuit, and I noted with interest that one of the four issues explored in some depth during that conference bore the label "Gender Bias in the Courts." The NCAA phrases the issue a bit differently, and with perhaps a slightly different focus. One of the three most important issues currently consuming that organization's time and attention is entitled "Gender Equity." At BYU, as elsewhere, the issue is an important one, in need of proactive attention. I invite all of us, therefore, to make an affirmative effort to eliminate useless and harmful stereotypical language, attitudes, and mind-sets from everything we do. Root and branch--but especially root--stereotypes have got to go, ranging all the way from our employment interviews to what we say and do in the classrooms and, more generally, to all of our social and other informal contacts. And I am speaking of categorical attitudes about both women and men. The effort to rid ourselves of generations of pernicious stereotypes affecting women is hardly served by bringing into being a new generation of stereotypes about men.<br><br>One of the most important tasks presently underway at BYU is the examination of our throughput challenges--the length of time that it takes to graduate. The references that we have made over the years to our four-year school have developed into a virtual euphemism, as our average has converted into almost six years. The reasons are multifaceted, complex, and sometimes interrelated. The expanded time required to graduate is not a phenomenon unique to BYU.<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>reports that most American institutions of higher education are facing an average throughput period of just under six years.<br><br>But the fact that others are also dealing with this problem does not make it any less serious a problem here. Neither does it mean that there is nothing we can do about it. The issue is particularly crucial for us, because if we can get that six-year average back down to four, we could for that reason alone increase by one-third the number of students to whom we could offer a BYU education. Some of the relevant issues will require board of trustees approval; some are matters with which we can deal; and some (such as our requirements for religious education and the comparatively high marriage rate among our students) are matters we do not want to change. As our study of these matters proceeds, and our understanding of the issues broadens, we will be making further proposals. Virtually all will involve you. One matter that warrants immediate attention concerns the increase in major requirements, and we have asked that each department, particularly those whose major requirements are above the 60-hour standard, give serious consideration to reducing the hours required to complete the major.<br><br>One of our strongest emphases over the past year--and also over the coming years--has been and will be academic freedom and, more specifically, academic freedom as it applies to our university. I believe that the work done by our specially appointed Committee on Academic Freedom over the past year may be one of the most significant occurrences at BYU in recent times. The committee was composed of some very thoughtful and talented people, and collectively they occupy a broad and diverse range of interests and viewpoints. I thank and commend them for their excellent work, and all of you for your input.<br><br>Academic freedom is an indispensable mainstay of any university. It has a special significance at BYU. Because our scope of inquiry is broader, reaching into religious as well as secular realms, our need for a free environment in which we study, teach, and learn has a correspondingly broader reach.<br><br>As the committee's report correctly recognizes, there are actually two components to academic freedom. One is the freedom of the individual to pursue areas of interest and concern free of outside pressure or inhibitions, and the other is the freedom of the institution to determine for itself what kind of institution it will be.<br><br>Both of these components of academic freedom are essential to any university worthy of that label, and they are particularly important at BYU. Let me say just a word about each of them. The theoretical underpinning of individual academic freedom is that truth can be best pursued in an atmosphere free from unwarranted inhibitions on the development and expression of thoughts and ideas. Perhaps the most eloquent statement of this proposition is found in Milton's<i>Areopagitica,</i>in which he defends the principles of free speech and free press and more specifically argues against prior restraints by contending as follows: "So Truth be in the field. . . . Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter." This phrase, "So Truth be in the field. . . . Let her and falsehood grapple," was always one of my two favorites that I used in teaching the free-speech portions of constitutional law. I found it sweetly ironic that John Tanner, chair of the committee that drafted our academic freedom document, is an expert on Milton. There are two other quotes that I have found helpful. One comes from Justice Holmes: "The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market." And the other is John Stuart Mill's observation that "he who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that."<br><br>Actually, these affirmations by Milton, Holmes, Mill, and others are simply other means of expressing the foundational principle that has always underlain our missionary efforts: All we ask is that you hear us out; give our truths a chance to be heard and considered.<br><br>The basic premises underlying institutional academic freedom are in some respects the same and in some respects different. The classic statement comes from Justice Frankfurter: "The four essential freedoms of a university" include the freedom "to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study."<i>Sweezy v. New Hampshire</i>354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957)<br><br>In other words, freedom of expression protects more than just the solitary individual or team of colleagues expressing his or her or their views. It also protects groups, organizations, institutions. As stated by Justice Frankfurter, when applied to academic institutions it includes the right of the school, acting through its duly constituted policy-making bodies, to decide, as a matter of the institution's academic freedom, what kind of school it will be, who will teach, what will be taught, how it will be taught, and who will attend. And these institutional rights rest not just on contract or on property ownership, but even more fundamentally on principles of freedom--academic freedom--probably rooted in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<br><br>In most of their applications, individual and institutional academic freedoms are mutually supportive and constitute a smooth and harmonious working tandem. There are some instances where accommodations have to be made between the two. The basic reason accommodations are necessary is that in neither its individual nor its institutional component is academic freedom an absolute, unencumbered guarantee. Indeed, I know of no freedom of expression, nor an other freedom of any kind--no matter how important as a free-standing right--that is unlimited. Every freedom, indeed every right of any kind, is subject to being tempered because of other interests--personal, governmental, or other institutional--that must be taken into account.<br><br>The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is phrased in absolute, unqualified language: "Congress [which means government at any level] shall make no law. . . ." The language is unequivocal. Government "shall make no law." It does not say that government shall make no unreasonable laws or unduly burdensome ones. Rather, the language appears to permit no laws, no restrictions, whatsoever. But over the two centuries that our First Amendment has existed, it has never been interpreted as containing absolute guarantees. The seemingly boundless language is in fact subject to some rather significant limitations, including those dealing with subversive speech, defamation, obscenity, fighting words, and others.<br><br>Those of us who work at BYU enjoy a greater measure of academic freedom--in the largest and most complete sense of that term--than we could ever expect at any other school. The reasons go far beyond the obvious fact that here, unlike public universities, there are no prohibitions against such activities as religious discussion and prayer as part of our academic program. More significant than the absence of these negatives is the existence of some positives. For the large majority of us, the restored gospel and its constituent principles are of central importance, and similarly important are the interrelationships between principles of restored truth and the postulates of our academic discipline. Given these realities, academic freedom in its broadest sense--and for us, its most important sense--includes as one of its cornerstones the freedom to integrate these two overriding interests, and to do so as part of our legitimate, and expected, academic endeavors. As stated by the faculty members who drafted our own academic freedom statement: "As a religiously distinctive university, BYU opens up a space in the academic world in which its faculty and students can pursue knowledge in light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. . . . To seek knowledge in the light of revealed truth is, for believers, to be free indeed." Brigham Young University, with its two campuses, constitutes the only four-year university in the world where this kind of side-by-side study of restored truth and secular knowledge is not only recognized as legitimate, but positively encouraged. When it comes to matters that really count, therefore, our range of uninhibited academic freedom is both broader and richer than at any other institution in the world.<br><br>But this does not mean that academic freedom here is without limits. For reasons already stated, any expressive freedom carries some limitations. The same is true of academic freedom. Fortunately, at BYU they are fairly narrow in scope and have a quite identifiable focus. Not surprisingly, what those limits attempt to prevent is the degradation of the Church's interests by its own employees. The general principle, as stated by our academic freedom document, is that we are not to do or say things that will "seriously and adversely affect the university mission or the Church." The examples identified by the committee were (1) contradicting or opposing--rather than analyzing or discussing--fundamental Church doctrine or policy, (2) deliberately attacking or deriding the Church or its general leaders; or (3) violating the Honor Code. These three examples are not intended to be exclusive, because there may be other activities that could "seriously and adversely affect the interests of the Church."<br><br>Does the committee's document anticipate all of the circumstances that might be covered by the general principle "serious and adverse effect on the university mission or the Church"? Clearly it does not. Equally clearly, it would be impossible to do so. And in the fact that the committee members opted for general principles rather than specificity is, in my view, one of the great strengths of their overall product. It seldom works for a legislative or quasi-legislative body to attempt to anticipate in advance all specific applications of a general principle. Rather, the better approach is to state the general principle, and let the specifics evolve through a case-to-case decisional process in light of the particular facts as they are presented by individual cases. The opposite approach is not only a bad idea, in most cases it just will not work.<br><br>In one sense, this new document is not new at all. It simply restates the commonsense principle that most of us have accepted for a long time: We will not use our positions and the resources that go with those positions, all of which are provided by the Church, for purposes that will be harmful to the Church or to the Lord we worship. The "new" aspect of this document, therefore, is that it gives us a more precisely stated framework within which to operate. One of its principal attributes, as well as one of its greatest strengths (though necessarily an unstated one), will be an overlay of common sense, goodwill, and those human qualities so beautifully summarized by the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants that will pervade its implementation. In the great majority of instances, you and I will be the principal players in that implementation.<br><br>Whereas the academic freedom document quite properly is limited to activities that seriously and adversely affect the interests of the university and the Church, I would hope that all of us, not as a matter of contractual or other obligation, but just as a matter of good sense, pursuant to our shared interest in the university, would always take into account the effect of what we do on the larger institution. The document drafted by our faculty committee is not tantamount to a statute in the sense that once we have brought ourselves into compliance we need have no further concern about the underlying academic freedom values on which that document rests. The document itself summarizes generations of experience and tradition and provides a helpful foundation on which we can build. But our real aspirations for both individual and academic freedom, as well as our aspirations for building BYU into the kind of university that it can and must be, will rest not with any document nor any standard susceptible to institutional enforcement. Rather, it rests solidly on the collective strength that will come from the individual visions and efforts of every one of us.<br><br>Several have asked about the statement of August 16, 1991, by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve concerning participation in certain symposia. That statement was issued to all Church members, as advice from Church leaders whom we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. It was not limited to BYU, nor to persons employed at institutions of higher learning, but it surely includes all BYU personnel. Because I have been asked, I am happy to share with you my own personal views.<br><br>I believe that the statement reflects a concern over whether the content of the presentation, either by itself or in context, would be harmful to Church interests. One of the statement's main thrusts, it seems to me, is that there are certain things we should do privately rather than publicly--certain issues and points of view that should more appropriately be raised directly with the persons affected, rather than with a broader audience. My own experience--both at BYU and also in other settings, mainly governmental--bears out the wisdom of distinguishing between what is appropriate for public discussion and what can more usefully be resolved in private. I have appreciated the fact that some of you over the past year have asked my advice as you have sought to find the dividing line between the two. I invite you to continue to do so.<br><br>In some contexts, agreeing to speak can itself carry an implied endorsement of the symposium, apart from the content of the individual presentation. In the words of the statement itself: "We are especially saddened at the participation of our own members, especially those who hold Church or other positions that give them stature among Latter-day Saints and who have allowed their stature to be used to promote such presentations."<br><br>I find highly significant the fact that the decision to issue this statement was made, after solemn and prayerful consideration, by those whom the Lord has charged with the responsibility of making such decisions. I find further persuasive the fact that the Brethren so rarely make a statement such as this one. If there has ever been another comparable statement during my lifetime, I cannot recall it. I hope we will all take it seriously.<br><br>Brigham Young University has no more valuable asset than our shared values. We see this institution as more than just a place where we make our living, and indeed, more than just a place where we teach and learn and study and create. One important aspect of our shared value system that makes my job much easier and more enjoyable is the sense of common ownership that the overwhelming majority of us feel. To a remarkable extent--particularly when compared with other large institutions with which I have been affiliated--there is an absence of "us and them." We are all "us." I notice the manifestations of this in several significant ways, including a deference to decisions that are made by those who are in authority, a presumption (rebuttable to be sure, but a presumption nevertheless) that the judgments which are made are correct, and an even stronger presumption that whether correct or not, they are made in good faith. And I assure you they are made in good faith. This is<i>our</i>university, yours and mine. We all have an ownership interest in it, and I am grateful that in so many of our relationships, that common equity interest we share is evident in the way we deal with each other and with our common objectives.<br><br>I have really appreciated the periodic inquiries I have had from different ones of you to the effect: "What can I do to help?" Frankly, just asking that question is itself helpful. It shows that you care. And now let me give you my answer. More than anything else, I wish that all 4,250 of us for whom BYU is our employment home would, in addition to fulfilling his or her own immediate responsibilities, rise above those duties an do two things. The first is, remember that BYU is an integral part of the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ, so that our immediate activities are necessarily keyed to the larger objective of kingdom building. Second, ask yourselves, each one of you, what you can do--in addition to performing the particular responsibility contained in your job description--to promote our shared broader interest in the university as a whole. Your indispensable role in implementing the Honor Code is an essential part, but only a part. For about a quarter of a century now, agencies of the federal government have been required by law to analyze the environmental input of any major governmental action that they take. Indeed, the words "environmental impact statement" have become virtually a household phrase. A less formal procedure, but one that serves the same purpose, is an "environmental impact assessment." What I am suggesting is that on some occasions it would be very helpful if you would mentally and informally incorporate into some of the decisions you make a "university impact assessment." Another way of putting it: I am inviting you, as one of my co-owners of this university, to share with me more the long view of what the university's interests are and how we can best achieve them.<br><br>The large aspects of our common endeavor, our BYU, our school in Zion, are quite clear to me. First, or university exists and functions as an integral part of the larger restored kingdom of Jesus Christ, just as each college and department and program is itself an integral part of the university. Second, and closely related to the first, we are primarily an undergraduate teaching university, though our graduate programs, scholarly and creative work, and research are commensurate with and essential to our total university program. Third, we must marshall all of our resources, both qualitatively and quantitatively so as to provide the unique benefits of a BYU education to as many persons as possible who are able and willing to take advantage of it. In this regard several exciting initiatives are already under way. Fourth, and finally, we are just on the threshold of the era of greatest progress of our history. The key to capitalizing on our opportunities will be found in our shared vision of what we can do, and our shared commitment to do it. It is roughly analogous to the transition from the Old Testament to the New Testament. Clearly, it is important for us to be concerned with a few basic "thou shalt nots." But even more important are our opportunities to help each other--and in the process, ourselves and our university--through positive, affirmative, proactive efforts. It is good not to set fire to the house. It is even better to make the house a better place to live.<br><br>Abba Eban once said of a certain group that they never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Over the coming year, and beyond, our opportunities are abundant and bright. Working together with you, pursuant to our common interest, I look forward to those opportunities. That our Heavenly Father will bless us toward that end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when this address was delivered at the BYU Annual University Conference on 24 August 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>, Mentoring, and Things of the Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My respect associates of this great Brigham Young University, I am honored, challenged, and pleased to be with you on this occasion. I hope my remarks and observations will bring glad tidings into your various responsibilities and assignments as well as into your lives. As I stand before you, I remind you of what I constantly try to remind myself--that I was asked to be with you and speak on this subject because of the office I fill and not because of any superlative qualities I possess.<br><br>A few weeks ago I was reading from some of the writings of our prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, and was again impressed by his thoughts and his relationship to others. He said that one of this "most revered associates with the Brethren was with President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. He was a mentor to a few of us seated here this day. His was a depth of<i>intellect</i>and<i>breadth of wisdom</i>that marked him a giant among men. And that because these qualities were tempered with deep humility and a sense of great reverence and dependency upon God."<br><br>He referred to President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., as his mentor and openly acknowledged how he was taught, tempered, and trusted by this great leader. Incidentally, may I remind you, by definition a mentor is a wise and trusted teacher or guide. He, President Clark, said on one very moving occasion:<br><br>"The youth of the Church, your students, are in great majority sound in thought and in spirit. The problem primarily is to<i>keep them sound</i>, not<i>to convert them</i>.<br><br>"The youth of the Church are hungry for things of the spirit; they are eager to learn the gospel, and they want it straight, undiluted. They want to know about the fundamentals . . . about our beliefs; they want to gain testimonies of their truth; they are not now doubters but inquirers, seekers after truth.<i>Doubt must not be planted in their hearts.</i><br><br>"These students crave the faith their fathers and mothers have; they want it in its simplicity and purity . . . they wish to be not only the beneficiaries of this faith, but they want to be themselves able to call it forth to work.<br><br>"You teachers have a great mission. As teachers you stand upon the highest peak in education, for what teaching can compare in priceless value and in far-reaching effect with that which deals with man as he was in the eternity of yesterday, as he is in the mortality of today, and as he will be in the forever of tomorrow. Not only time but eternity is your field."<br><br>As teachers, administrators, staff, and friends you have the opportunity to be mentor to many. How rewarding it will be to be mentor to those who associate with you closely on a daily basis.<br><br>In days past I identified with President N. Eldon Tanner, a counselor in the First Presidency four times. He was not only a prophet, seer, revelator, and apostle, but a mentor. He took the time and the occasion to lift, teach, and lead me and others when teaching moments were available. He was always bigger than any problem.<br><br>It seemed to me that whenever there were weighty decisions to be made at the highest levels of the Church, he had a unique capacity to be wise when others were disappointed, shocked, or dismayed. Never in a spirit of disgust or hurt did I ever hear him say "Oh no" or "How could she or he do that?" It was always "What can we do to help?" He was always a solver, never a moaner.<br><br>Let me take this opportunity to thank President Rex E. Lee for his leadership--for what he is and does. Almost 34 years ago he was called to serve on the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association while I was in the presidency of that organization. He was a young returned missionary with exceptional dedication and talents. As I look back now, I can see how he "mentored" some of us older ones as he vigorously championed programs for young men and young women. Today, yes, I and others can learn much if we appropriately respond to his leadership. You don't have to be older than others to be their mentor. I look upon Provost Bruce C. Hafen as an administrator who is honest, wise, and good.<br><br>May I now quote--as a background and foundation for what I will refer to later--a statement recently made by your leaders from an internal document entitled "Our Positioning Case Statement":<br><br>"As a Church university, BYU has the responsibility to help students develop their spiritual strength as well as their academic proficiency--to help them learn that faith and reason go hand in hand. Wisdom, it has been revealed, is the result of acquiring knowledge through light and truth. Such enlightenment is said to be received through the<i>heart</i>, which encompasses more than just the intellect. Thus, it is often stated that BYU aims to educate the heart, for to educate just the mind would severely limit the human soul.<br><br>"Through this process of seeking for all truth in the light, BYU students learn wisdom--how to use truth for right and just purposes. The course is a rigorous one that involves both teacher and student and includes the development of, and respect for, the spirit that is in each of them."<br><br>I wholeheartedly endorse those guidelines of great wisdom. Now from the 98th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 10, there are three words that I would like to emphasize. Be<i>honest</i>,<i>wise</i>, and<i>good</i>in our personal lives, in our BYU responsibilities, and in the home. We should teach our associates and students by example the priceless strength that comes from this lifestyle.<br><br>I would like to reinforce to you in your BYU situation of service: You have been sought out, interviewed, approved, and employed because of your quality lives. We who work with you look forward to upholding and sustaining you in your lofty and righteous performances.<br><br>Some things change, and some remain the same.<br><br>In the category of those that remain the same is the relationship between Brigham Young University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. BYU is owned and operated by the Church. During the lifetime of all of those present here, the Church has appropriated to BYU a large proportion of the tithing paid by members of the Church. Because of the importance the Church attaches to education, the BYU Board of Trustees is composed of the most senior leaders of the Church. The board of trustees appoints the president and other leaders of the university, and the board of trustees makes the basic policy decisions about the nature and mission of the university and the way in which that mission will be accomplished. These things have not changed.<br><br>In contrast, there have been enormous changes in the environment within which the university performs its mission. Not long ago, almost any young member of the Church who desired to enroll at BYU in Provo or Hawaii or at Ricks College was able to obtain admission. The remarkable growth of the Church has changed that. Today only a tiny fraction of the membership of the Church can enroll at BYU or these other colleges, and that fraction gets smaller every year, even though the percent of tithing revenues devoted to higher education has not declined significantly. The contrast between those who are favored by admission and those who are not is very painful for all concerned. It inevitably causes all of us to have serious reflection about the mission of BYU and the way that mission is being performed.<br><br>For the past two years the board of trustees and committees of board members, working with President Lee and his associates, have been giving intensive and prayerful study to fundamental issues, which are the nature of the university, how it is financed, how it relates to other parts of the Church Educational System, and how we determine who is admitted. That work continues.<br><br>Here on this campus you have done impressive work on these and related problems. For example, the board of trustees is very impressed with the work of your faculty committee under the chairmanship of Professor John Tanner. Their suggestions on definitions of academic freedom for the individual teacher and for the institution are vitally important.<br><br>It is important that our teachers have the freedom to teach and research in their fields of study. At the same time, it is imperative that everyone who works at BYU and everyone who supports the university (and that includes every tithe payer in the Church) understands the nature and mission of this university.<br><br>We do not question the need to familiarize university students with facts we deplore or theories we reject. But, in the exercise of our institutional academic freedom, we do insist that the teachers in the various institutions of our Church Educational System not use their classrooms or their privileged positions as professors to advocate or foster ideologies or philosophies or actions that are contrary to the standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ, including the standards of decency or morality that are embodied in the university's honor code. The unworthy, the indecent, or the immoral have no place on this campus, no place in the programs of this university, and no place in the personal conduct of our students or our faculty or staff.<br><br>We expect that our Church Educational System personnel, including the faculty and staff at BYU, will be role models in the way they use the sacred resources appropriated by the Church. This includes not only financial resources but also the prestige they enjoy as representatives of the Church. As members of the Church, they should also be exemplary in the way they keep the commandments of God and in the way they respond to the counsel our leaders give to the members of the Church.<br><br>"Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil.<br><br>"And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<br><br>"For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith." (D&amp;amp;C 98:10–12)<br><br>May I encourage all of us this year as we approach new responsibilities and challenges to teach vigorously the basics of being honest, wise, and good in life and in the lecture room. The world today--and yes, the Church today--is looking for direction from those who live these traits. It seems today as I travel and reorganize stake presidencies and instruct mission presidents worldwide, I am getting back more and more to stressing these fundamental basics of the abundant life. The important roles of leadership must be wrapped in honesty, goodness, and wise performance. Love the scriptures. Teach and live through and by them. Teach and live with the gospel of Jesus Christ as your anchor, foundation, and inspiration.<br><br>May I share with you a last paragraph from former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett's new book<i>The De-Valuing of America</i>:<br><br>"Reclaiming our institutions is less a political opportunity than a civic obligation. It involves hard work. But it is work of imminent importance. At the end of the day, somebody's values will prevail. In America, 'we the people' have a duty to insist that our institutions and our government be true to their time-honored tasks. In some instances that means that the American people must roll up their sleeves and work to ensure that their institutions and government reflect their sentiments, their good sense, their sense of right and wrong. That is what a democracy--a government of, by, and for the people--is all about. The debate has been joined.<i>But the fight for our values has just begun</i>."<br><br>Let me share with you a remarkable statement by President Spencer W. Kimball that illustrates to us how we may develop more spirituality in our lives. "I find that when I get casual in my relationship with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more I find it easier to abide their counsel. (<i>Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</i>, p. 135.)<br><br>Personal honesty is a must in individual happiness and true leadership. Certainly it is greater to be trusted than loved. A worthy daily prayer is: "Lord, help me to be honest with myself. Help me to be true to myself." Jesus taught in plainness. Jesus, the master teacher, taught love, hope, and faith with perfect integrity, even with a perfect life. I thank God that one of our Articles of Faith does not say: "We believe in honesty." It is more compelling and reasonable to say "We believe in being honest." Over the years it has not only been rewarding but challenging to hear by the grapevine, if you please, "Marvin J. Ashton can be trusted."<br><br>Be honest in your classes. Be honest in your offices. Be honest in your human relationships. Be honest in your preparations. Be honest in your counseling procedures. Be honest in your daily lives. I thank God for leaders like you who instill in others the overwhelming influence of integrity in all things. I thank God Brigham Young University has the best administrators, faculty, and support staff of any university in the world. With that recognition our challenge is to rise to new heights.<br><br>Early on I can remember a good father saying, "I would rather have my son drink 10 cups of coffee a day than tell a lie." He didn't want me to drink coffee either. He was just setting proper priorities. Some top students and associates can be destroyed by people who are not honest in their comments and instruction. Some would rather share flattery or tickle the ear than indulge in constructive instruction.<br><br>Let me share a few thoughts about education and teaching with wisdom and being wise enough to make decisions that are worthy. I carry in my daily datebook a few brief memo sheets that I like to refer to frequently. One sheet almost worn out now has nothing more on it than Jacob 6, verse 12, "O be wise; what can I say more?"<br><br>Be wise enough to accept appropriate discipline and guidelines. Be wise enough to say the right words at the right time to the right person. Be wise enough to live and teach within designated guidelines. Be wise enough to know there is always going to be opposition from those who would have us trip or falter. We need scholars, teachers, and administrators who are balanced. We need intellectuals who are intelligent. We need probers who aggressively pursue the truth. We need researchers who are willing to pray. We need teachers who teach with Christlike parables. Ever bear in mind that Jesus was the wisest of the wise, even brilliant, in his relationships with people.<br><br>A certain prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, on one occasion a few years ago asked me to accompany him to the Utah State Prison. He invited me to go to the vineyards with him because I, Marvin J. Ashton, knew the location. He wanted to spend some time with those confined to prison. On this occasion I heard and saw a prophet declare glad tidings in a way that has left me with an everlasting impression. It was a unique invitation. It was an unusual request. I doubt that any other apostle in modern days has had an experience that comes even close to this. I learned much from a prophet who was wise.<br><br>May I say in the beginning when he first asked me to accompany him to the prison at the point of the mountain. I felt impressed to say to him. "President Kimball, I don't want you to go to the prison for a visit. I've had enough experience there to know that your life would be in danger, and some people would do anything to get attention, embarrass, or even harm you. Please, President Kimball, if you don't mind, let's not go right now."<br><br>A few days passed and he talked to me on the telephone again and said, "Marv, I want to go to the prison with you." I could tell that he was earnest and very sincere. The time for delay was over. I called the warden and asked him if we could come down the following day and visit with him and two inmates of his choice. He agreed, and I took President Kimball to the institution.<br><br>We were greeted by the warden and taken to his office. He hadn't been there very long when two inmates were invited to come in and meet with us. They were in their prison garb and looked hard. I felt very uneasy when the steel door closed behind them and we were left with the two of them, the Prophet, myself, and the warden.<br><br>President Kimball shook their hands before we all sat down. This was followed by a brief period of intense silence. The prisoners were looking at the floor. President Kimball was looking at them, and I was looking at him. After this awkward period of silence was over, President Kimball started off with what seemed to me to be an unusual approach. The thought crossed my mind that he could say: "What are you in here for? Why did you do it? When do you get out? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves," or "What is your previous record?" To my pleasure and further education and for their involvement, he looked at the one, and said to my surprise: "Tell me about your mother." The prisoner responded and told President Kimball and others of us assembled about his mother, the details of which are not important for my purposes today.<br><br>When this was over, with the prisoner doing the talking and President Kimball doing the listening, President Kimball finally looked at the other prisoner and said: "What does your father do for a living?" He too responded with comments, and the Prophet gave complete attention and listened intently. In a few minutes I had seen and heard a prophet counsel and interview. They looked at him, responded, and looked in his face while he gently listened. Before our interview was over, word had spread that President Kimball was at the prison visiting, and some of the media were outside the doors waiting for pictures and conversation with President Kimball. President Kimball invited some of the press into the room with a cameraman. One reporter said, "President Kimball, we'd like to have a picture of you talking to these two inmates." President Kimball granted the interview by standing up promptly and getting between the two prisoners as the picture was taken.<br><br>I recall as though it were yesterday what he said after the picture was taken. He shook one hand and then the other and said, "Thank you, boys, for letting me have my picture taken with you." One of these hardened prisoners was in for murder and the other one for grand larceny. To say they were touched and responsive is an understatement.<br><br>I will never forget the impact of this visit upon me and my future. A wise, gentle prophet conducted his interview without embarrassment, without ridicule, and without condemnation. I know I have told this story before and shared it around the Church, but I felt impressed to relive it with you just for a few moments today as we think of interviewing, counseling, instructing, and touching lives with wisdom. Frankly I still wonder if President Kimball's main purpose for the visit was to see the prisoners or to teach a new apostle in a live classroom. How wonderful it would be if we could counsel with wisdom under all circumstances. A well-respected administrator or teacher should be skilled in asking right questions.<br><br>Some months later in another vineyard a mother and father were in my office accompanied by a 265-pound BYU sophomore All-WAC tackle. They had asked for an appointment to help resolve a confusing family situation. After we greeted the mother and the father and their son, Lance Reynolds, we had a few words of friendly conversation. I knew why they had come. The trying decision was Does Lance go on a mission or does he stay and play football?<br><br>I looked at the mother and said, "What do you think your son should do?" She said, "I think he can render a special service and example to the Church if he maintains his standards and continues to play football and hopefully help in bringing football fame to BYU and the Church. I think his football playing can be his mission."<br><br>I looked at the father, and I said, "What do you think Lance should do?" He was smart enough not to disagree in that setting with his wife, so he merely said, "I'm not quite certain." I looked at Lance and I said. "Lance, what do you want to do?" He said, "I want to go on a mission." I responded with, "Why don't you?" He said, "I will." Our interview was over. Lance went on his mission, was an outstanding missionary, came back and reaped all-conference honors, and is now on BYU's football coaching staff. He is a special friend of mine today.<br><br>I hope you can relate to these two experiences. Jesus went about doing good. Jesus taught single ideas. He drove home the single point in each of his parables. We should avoid shotgun approaches. A good lesson or interview should be like a rifle shot--to the point and with some decision reached.<br><br>Let me conclude with a few thoughts in regard to being good. To be good for our purposes today is to be someone who is caring, someone who conducts himself in such a way that others know that service and being good to all others under every circumstance is the abundant life. Being good does not start in the classroom or in the office of administrators. It is an every-hour, significant way of life. Let us ever remember that being good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure. Let us lead in such a manner that being good is a way of life that must be natural, commonplace, and sincere. I like to think someone is good, in the full sense of the word, when they care about others without thought of self.<br><br>What greater recognition and honor can come to anyone than to be identified as a good teacher. Jesus Christ was the master teacher. A stalwart like BYU's Hugh Nibley teaches us much when he said, "I have always been furiously active in the Church, but I have . . . never held an office or rank in anything; I have undertaken many assignments given me by the leaders of the Church, and much of the work has been anonymous--no rank or recognition, no anything. While I have been commended for some things, they were never the things I considered most important--that was entirely a little understanding between me and my Heavenly Father, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, though no one else knows anything about it."<br><br>A recent<i>Wall Street Journal</i>editorial made the following observation:<br><br>"Los Angeles has brought home to the country and the world what people close to the cauldron have been saying for a long time: No progress is possible in America's most troubled parts while so many people grow up without parents, without dignity, without knowledge, without morals or without respect--from others and within themselves. In a word, without hope."<br><br>Let me conclude by saying I thank God for good people like you who are willing to be reminded and hopefully instructed by one who has a few thoughts that possibly can be helpful. The glory of God is intelligence, and for my purposes here today I declare that there is no true intelligence without honesty, wisdom, and goodness. I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.

<h1> upon Strong Foundations - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At the beginning of my remarks I also wish to take the privilege of again extending my thanks to Stan Albrecht and Dennis Thomson. I recently reread the talk that Stan gave to us on this occasion last year, and I was struck once more with his insight and devotion. Stan gave as much of his energy to this institution as anyone could, and my admiration for him is deep and strong. I miss him very much in our office. President Holland once said of Dennis that "he wears well." This is a perceptive comment, because Dennis does work that is thorough and thoughtful. His influence will be lasting in the university, and I miss him as well.<br><br>I am also very grateful that Clayne Pope and John Tanner have agreed to join with Bevan Ott and Bob Webb in the academic vice president's office. I have already come to rely heavily on all of these fine colleagues.<br><br>As I begin my term in this present office, I would like to provide an evaluation of a number of aspects of BYU and then list several wishes I have for the university in the future. Although I am dependent on many colleagues for both data and perspectives, my observations will necessarily be personal. For those whose experience with the university predates mine, I apologize for the beginning point. But reflecting on what I have observed helps me to note the immense development of this institution over the years. It also helps me to remain convinced that the direction we have received from our board has consistently aimed us toward the kind of university we should be striving to become.<br><br>My first memory of Brigham Young University is only fleeting and impossible for me to date precisely, but it must have occurred sometime in late 1940 or early 1941. My dad, who joined the faculty here in 1938, brought me up the south entry of the campus and, among other things, showed me the workers who must have been just finishing the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. With the Smith Building completed, even more of the activities of the college students moved to upper campus, as we called it. There were, after all, four major academic buildings up here, so more room could be made down below for the training school and BY High, which shared the lower campus with the college. Those who were around when the next construction began undoubtedly knew that a few more buildings might sometime be built, but only the rare visionary, who remembered talk of temples of learning covering the entire hill, could possibly have anticipated the current campus with its hundreds of acres. While buildings do not make a university, I still think that the contrast of these two times on our campus presents a pretty good symbol of the distance we have come.<br><br>(I have another, still less academic example. My first chance to have any schooling through BYU came in 1946, when I transferred to the BY Training School in the fourth grade. At that time our activity cards got us into the home football games of the college. I was going to show you the football schedule from that year and compare it to this fall's schedule, but that wouldn't really be fair--football was barely back on campus after being furloughed during WW II. So I chose to make the comparison with 1949, the year I got to go over to the junior high school (Figure 1). You will note that while some of the opponents were universities we play today, several others have given up football. None of us in those days could have imagined that we would play UCLA, Penn State, and Notre Dame in one season.)<br><br>Throughout this talk, I will occasionally refer back to older times to help put today's university into perspective, but I will concentrate largely on what I believe to be our strengths and some of our most important challenges. I will begin with our students.<br><br>There is no doubt in my mind that a combination of demographics in the Church, forward-thinking admissions policies, increased parental involvement, enlarged academic reputation, and low costs has brought us the brightest and best-prepared students in the university's history. The rate of increased qualifications is clearly accelerating. Figure 2, for example, shows the average GPA and ACT scores of the entering classes for the past four years (Figure 2). When we get increases of as much as one-half GPA or one-half ACT point in a year, we are changing substantially. To put the ACT scores in perspective, note the chart showing the percentiles of the scaled scores (Figure 3). We are now taking almost our entire entering class from the highest quarter of those who are taking the examination. You will note that because of the nature of scaled scores, very little differentiation is made at the ends. Thus any student who receives a 31 or above falls into the highest one percentile in the nation. For the fall of 1992, we have accepted over 800 students who fall in this category. Some of them will go elsewhere, but a great majority of them will be in our classes next week.<br><br>There are other data about students that are instructive. The next chart shows the top 20 universities in the United States in terms of National Merit Scholars enrolled in 1991 (Figure 4). (The information for 1992 is not yet available, but we do not anticipate much of a change in our position.) You will note quite a drop from Harvard at the top, but our tie for tenth position puts us in the middle of some very impressive company.<br><br>As the word got out that our colleagues in admissions were moving from predicted college grades to a preparation index as the primary admissions criterion, our potential students began to enroll for better and better high school courses. One result of this development has been a spectacular boom in the number of students enrolled in advanced placement courses in the high schools from which we draw the majority of our students. The result of this dramatic increase is that we are among the top three universities in the United States when it comes to the number of applications for AP credit we receive (Figure 5). I am aware that there are reasons to be careful about how we use this credit, and we will continue to review both the test levels at which we grant credit and how we count it at BYU. But you will note again that the other universities in this list are some with which we would be pleased to be compared. And there is no doubt that the AP courses give our students excellent preparation for the classes they will take here.<br><br>I would like to also comment on the religious and spiritual capacities of our students. Here I will be cautious: I have written elsewhere that my roles as a judge caused me more apprehension than any other part of being a bishop, and I had been set apart to make judgments. I sincerely wish that we would all exercise restraint when we presume to evaluate the spiritual condition of others. But I think that we have very good young people who are admitted here. I cannot tell whether they are the best we have ever had, but it is my opinion that they are clearly further removed from the worldly culture from which they come than any previous group. That is, when you compare them to the others who were in their high schools, and when you see the bombardments from the media and environment to which they have been subjected, they are remarkably strong and good. I know of some of their problems, but when I visit the BYU married ward to which I am assigned as a high councilor, I am constantly reminded how much more seriously they study the gospel and how much more they trouble themselves over the welfare of others than my acquaintances and I did when we were their age.<br><br>Thus I am a little unhappy when an occasional colleague belittles our admissions process with such comments as "Now if you could only get us some spiritual students." We know that some unworthy students do come to BYU, and we are trying to be as careful as possible to insure that bishops and others do not use us as a place to reform their wayward young people. We have made several significant changes to the admissions procedures in an attempt to make sure that we are as thorough as possible in this respect. But what troubles me in such comments in the implication that increasing the academic qualifications of the students automatically lowers their religious commitments. I believe that at their roots these remarks are insulting to the Church when they imply that the gospel is most appealing to the less intelligent or less well educated. I would never wish to imply the spiritual superiority of the bright and learned; the most faithful person I met on my mission was among the most humble in these respects. But the fact that we have a Church university should argue against the opposite perspective. I am very pleased with our students' religious commitments in most important respects. Altogether they are the best we have ever had.<br><br>We do have a number of significant issues to face in relation to our students. The most troubling of these for me is the fact that we can admit only an increasingly small number of those who are qualified and worthy. In case you have not seen the actual figures, here are the data on the number of Church members in the United States and Canada who will turn 18 during the next period of time (Figure 6). You will note that we will have significant increases until the year 1997, when a decline should start. But we have difficulty knowing whether or to what degree that decline will happen, since these figures only include those young people who are on current Church records and do not account for any conversions, which we know will occur. Moreover, these figures say nothing about potential students from outside the U.S.-Canada area.<br><br>One immediate challenge we have faced as various factors have pushed up our test scores is that competition for our limited scholarship money has become more and more keen. Recently our scholarship office prepared us a report in which they showed that we would need more than a million additional dollars for this fall if we were to award freshman scholarships at the same qualification level we used in 1989. Students who are being offered four-year scholarships at other universities often have to settle for a one-year, one-half tuition scholarship here. Let me give you an example from this year's scholarship procedures. As you know, up to a certain point we weight our scores to account for the percent of basic courses that students have taken in high school. Arbitrary numbers are assigned that combine GPA and ACT plus the percent of basics. For students whose high school enrollment included at least 70 percent of basics, the point at which we awarded a four-year scholarship was 2.83 on the preparation index. This means that a student would be awarded such a scholarship if she or he had a 31 on the ACT (remember, this is in the first percentile) and a 4.0 grade point average. The GPA can drop clear down to 3.9 if the student achieves a 32 on the ACT. Finding sufficient funding to keep this situation from getting even worse is a major challenge. But we should also remember that all students who enroll here receive the equivalent of a two-thirds scholarship through the Church's investment in their education.<br><br>The increasing admissions levels also challenge us in our efforts to maintain a very desirable diversity in our student body. We have added a number of procedures in the admissions process (at a great time cost to the faculty and other members of the admissions committee, I would add) in an attempt to make sure that admission to BYU is not based solely on grades and test scores. But it would not be fair to the student who works diligently to qualify for admission if preparation were not a major factor. This preparation factor, however, cannot help but give an advantage to the young people whose families and friends begin early to guide them into the right classes and to stimulate them toward high academic achievement. Those young people without cultural support, and especially new converts from minority backgrounds, may not really be able to compete. We have begun to put in place a minority transfer consortium with a number of two-year feeder institutions, and we are aggressively recruiting qualified minority students. But we will continue to be challenged by the diversity problem. On the one hand, we cannot afford to bring in less-qualified students who will struggle unnecessarily in this challenging academic environment. On the other hand, we can ill afford to have our students become less and less representative of the young people in the Church.<br><br>Exacerbating our admissions problems is the matter that is generally called "throughput" in the literature of higher education. For a very complex number of reasons, students are taking longer and longer to graduate. This is not a problem limited to BYU. Indeed, some writers simply assert that the four-year college degree is a thing of the past. But many fine universities do a much better job getting students graduated than we do. Our students are averaging 11.9 semesters of enrollment before they graduate. Obviously, thousands of additional students could have an education here if we could improve our average even to 10 semesters. Now is not the time to discuss all of the actions that should be undertaken in this effort, but I would say that departments, colleges, and individual faculty will make most of the difference here.<br><br>As bright and prepared as they are, our students have some problems that we need to acknowledge. Few of them write well, and many will be hindered throughout their academic and professional careers if we do not continue and increase the very fine efforts of many of our units in insisting on a good deal of well-evaluated writing in classes across the university.<br><br>Unfortunately, many of these qualified and prepared students fail at their university experience. Last fall semester, 3,208 students were placed on academic warning or probation or were suspended from the university for academic reasons. Of these, between six and seven hundred were members of the freshman class, the most qualified class we have ever admitted. These figures mean that about one in 10 of the students enrolled last fall failed to achieve even minimal academic success. Clearly, there are many factors involved here, but we surely cannot expect that all student problems will be solved through higher admissions levels.<br><br>A walk around campus will soon convince all of us that a portion of our students still have not come to a conviction about the nature of honor. Like many of you, I am concerned that students will sign a pledge to observe the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards and then not do so. To me, honor is the most important part of the academic experience. I support completely the kinds of efforts to promote honor that were presented to us today. I think it is imperative that no student would ever be in doubt about a teacher's determination to award credit only to those students whose actions demonstrate the highest levels of honor.<br><br>These last comments about some problems our students have, and some of the challenges that we are facing because of increased quality, should not detract from my most important point: Our students are among the finest young people in the world, and they continue to make this university better than ever before.<br><br>Before I discuss some aspects of faculty performance, I would like to make a few comments on the support that the university receives. Here again, I believe we have every reason to be grateful and optimistic.<br><br>An issue of the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> published just a couple of weeks ago reported the results of a survey of over 500 colleges and universities in the United States. More than 81 percent of the institutions responded, and the results were very disturbing. Let me quote one short paragraph: "Nearly 60 percent of all colleges and universities experienced cuts in their operating budgets in 1991–92, forcing many to raise tuition, freeze faculty hiring, offer fewer sections of courses, or delay building repairs." By the same percentages, colleges anticipate further cuts in their 1992–93 operating budgets. Those colleges and universities most hurt were state operated. Many of you have heard of the drastic cuts at most of the institutions in the California State University System, where one university is contemplating eliminating at least seven departments and cutting as many as 190 faculty positions, of which about half are tenure or tenure-track positions. Forty-two percent of <i>all</i> public four-year colleges reported that they would provide no salary increases for faculty members in 1992–93, and 48 percent of these same institutions had imposed a freeze on hiring. But state universities are not alone: financial problems are challenging some of the most prominent private universities. One very prestigious Ivy League college reports that it needs about one billion dollars to repair its crumbling infrastructure.<br><br>Our situation at BYU is vastly better than is found elsewhere. Because of the careful financial practices of our board of trustees, we have not been subjected to the financial swings of other institutions. We have not only had modest salary increases this year, but the board also authorized salary adjustments, some quite substantial, for those full professors whose disciplines were shown to have fallen behind our reference group. University administrators throughout the country would be shaking their heads in disbelief if they knew how the board had treated us in this extraordinarily challenging financial atmosphere.<br><br>And because of the wise program of continuing maintenance at BYU, we are not going to find ourselves with most of our buildings collapsing. We have replaced the Joseph Smith Building, and the new science building and the renovation of the Eyring Science Center have received initial approval. We are also in the planning stage for expanding our two major libraries.<br><br>This continuing financial support--even in the face of a slumping economy and severe economic challenges elsewhere in higher education--does not mean, of course, that we are without our own problems. We may be the most efficient university in the country when it comes to the use of physical facilities, but we are very pressed when it comes to office, laboratory, and classroom space. Any number of you have reminded me of your special needs since I took this office only a few weeks ago. I expect that we will always have both financial needs and wants.<br><br>One area in which we are particularly challenged is in our libraries. As you are aware, major libraries across the nation face impressive obstacles to their efforts to continue providing faculty and students with the resources necessary to engage in informed teaching, meaningful research, and other forms of scholarly dialogue and learning. Our libraries no longer can house our collections, and, as noted, we are in the planning stage for additions. But one of the most serious financial challenges we face will not disappear with new facilities. The escalating cost of serials poses particularly difficult decisions. Essential academic journals range from $20 to $8,000 annually, and some of them have increased in cost over 400 percent during the past five years. We will have no choice but to discontinue some subscriptions. Because this is such a critical faculty matter, the library staff and Faculty Library Council will involve departments and disciplines in trying to determine which periodicals are most valuable to us.<br><br>But even while we are facing these important decisions, the libraries are undertaking important initiatives to increase the usefulness of the present collection to undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty alike. The Faculty Library Council, your departmental library representatives, and the library staffs will be happy to show you these helpful innovations.<br><br>I do not expect to see the day when we will not be faced with difficult resource decisions and when our needs and desires do not outstrip our ability to pay for them. But again, I am struck by how well we are supported and how far we have come in the two and one-half decades I have been here.<br><br>My evaluation of the faculty is overwhelmingly optimistic. I wish that I could have thought of some dramatic way to symbolize your extraordinary work in a visual way. But stacks of graded examinations and papers, or of books and articles published, while dramatic, don't convey much information. I do have some observations, however.<br><br>First, I believe that the faculty are overwhelmingly hard working. A recent thorough study (conducted by Bruce Chadwick, Howard Christensen, and David Magleby) of faculty time use shows that the average faculty member spends close to 50 hours per week in university business. Teaching takes about half of our time, and research and service take about one-quarter each. When each one adds family and Church activity to this list, it is clear that we are very busy.<br><br>The results of this hard work are easy to note. Our research productivity has increased at a rapid pace. A separate study by Bruce Higley indicates that the percentage of our time dedicated to teaching has remained remarkably steady since 1975. Yet we have hardly one department in which published results of our study have not doubled or tripled during that time. We need to be cautious in drawing conclusions, but a combination of various data would indicate that the vastly improved research productivity has not come at the expense of effort applied to teaching.<br><br>Because it is available through my own experience, I would like to give one example of the level of this scholarly productivity. Near the middle of my career here, the dean of the College of Humanities issued a 10-year bibliography of work published by that faculty. Last year the annual college bibliography contained more entries than were in the earlier 10-year collection.<br><br>Our goals in respect to this aspect of our assignments have been articulated very clearly in the memorandum to the faculty entitled "A Community of Scholars." I commend it and its message to you and hope that those who have not yet chosen to expand their teaching to a broader community will consider its contents particularly carefully.<br><br>There are a few ways to compare the teaching of the present with that of the past. I have already mentioned that our teaching effort remains largely unchanged, and excellent training and active research clearly make our present faculty stronger than ever in mastery of the subject matter. Moreover I have seen no evidence that there is any diminution of our concern for our students. I have asked two colleagues to look at the size of our classes over time, and I suspect that they will discover that our average class size has increased. If so, we may have greater challenges than in the past when it comes to giving personal attention to our students. But my intuitive conclusion is that in general we have not only maintained BYU's long tradition of excellent teaching, but we have also made progress in this matter.<br><br>I also believe that an overwhelming majority of our faculty are very supportive of our sponsoring Church. Again I hesitate to measure the strength of testimonies, but we do have data that indicate that faculty here are fulfilling a wide range of important Church callings. Moreover, my opportunity to observe faculty for most of five decades makes me pretty secure in the observation that our present faculty is as faithful as at any time in the past. I have no hesitation in recommending almost all of us as teachers and models for our children and those of other Church members.<br><br>There are a few habits of a minority of our faculty that I wish could be changed. For example, I am constantly amazed that some of the same faculty who ridicule conspiracy theories in the political world are certain that conspiracies run the university. As in politics, these theories often are used by both ends of the spectrum on any issue. I have heard the term "The Gang of 50," which apparently refers to a group of faculty and administrators who are plotting to secularize the university by forcing up our expectations. But another group insists with equal fervor that those same faculty and administrators are really trying to reverse the progress that has been made in the past and stop any important academic undertakings.<br><br>The fact is that conspiracies are very difficult to maintain and thus very unlikely. But such talk can start to become a disservice when it distracts us from the real problems and issues in the university. We need to discuss difficult questions--including how best to distribute limited resources, how to fulfill our prophetic mission on a day-to-day basis, how to balance competing interests for faculty time, etc.--and such discussion becomes very difficult when even a few faculty feel that all decisions have already been made in some clandestine fashion. Moreover, conspiracy theories deprive us of one of the most frequent of human products: the mistake. The fact is, a lot of our problems don't result from some sinister plot, but from the mere fact that we make mistakes--some of them dumb. As a dean and associate vice president (not to mention husband, father, and friend), I've made some pretty big mistakes, and I can almost guarantee you that this is one tradition I'll continue. I've also avoided some equally big mistakes because someone counseled me about the course I had chosen. But those who feel that every administrative action is the result of some brilliant, undercover master plan will never believe enough in dumbness to give us help. All of us are the poorer when this happens.<br><br>Some other small groups seem to be far too enamored of their graduate school experience. Clearly, our contacts with world-famous professors in the great research universities should be viewed in a very positive light, and we can learn much from these institutions. But they are rarely very good models for BYU, and those who would try to remake us in the image of such universities often push us in directions that are not in our best interest. I believe that we need to spend more time discovering how to be the best BYU and less trying to be a poor imitation of something else.<br><br>I also wish that we would not overvalue the abilities that our experiences at these universities helped us sharpen. While five or six years of graduate school may have started us on the path toward becoming pretty good scientists or literary scholars, they did not necessarily qualify us to redesign the campus, or to replace Norm Chow in calling the football plays, or to run the Church. I recognize the temptation to tell Norm after the fact that a draw play couldn't possibly have worked in those circumstances, and besides, trying to out-guess him is probably quite harmless (as long as neither he nor LaVell listens to us). The implications, however, about second-guessing prophets should be obvious.<br><br>To make my personal position on this last matter as unambiguous as possible, let me say the following: I believe that the leaders of this Church <i>are</i> prophets, that the President of the Church has the same authority from God and his son as did Moses or the other prophets of ancient times or this dispensation. Because of this belief, I wish to follow their direction in the same way that I hope I would have followed that of Moses. I hope that during a plague of snakes I would have fastened my eye on a serpent of brass rather than advising Moses that my training had taught me we should use snakebite kits. Moses accepted advice from Jethro and others when he felt it was right. But the record of those who rebelled against him was miserable.<br><br>Fortunately, as was the case when I acknowledged some problems with our students but recognized their great strengths, I can also certify that our faculty is of the highest quality. I can no longer separate the idea of being a professor from that of being a BYU professor. For me, association with you is one of the most important aspects of my life.<br><br>Clayne Pope has given me good counsel ever since I first met him. He recently cautioned me that our office should select a small number of issues to which to turn our main attention. He feels, rightly I'm sure, that long lists of goals dissipate energy and raise unfulfillable expectations. We are now in the process of selecting those issues where we can concentrate our attention.<br><br>But with your indulgence I am going to expand beyond that small list as I conclude this talk. I suppose what follows might be called my "wish list," because it includes several items, some of which we in the administration can influence only minimally. In a few cases I'll expand on the item. With others, I will simply list the challenge. The order is pretty well random, and I use numbers only to keep them separate.<br><br>1. I wish that we would take much better care of our students, particularly our freshman and those who are academically at risk or struggling. Because of our relations to them in the Church and the natural commitments of most of us as teachers, many of us individually do remarkable things for these young people. But we are far behind other institutions in establishing programs to mitigate the shock of the transition from high school to the university. And students who are not doing well need far more faculty and departmental attention.<br><br>2. I wish that we would think of effective ways to stress international matters at our institution. Certainly some of our richest intellectual resources are the foreign-language abilities and international experiences of our students. While some programs have moved to take advantage of this treasure, many have not. As Cheryl Brown has put it, we've been content to harvest the timber above a rich gold mine.<br><br>3. I wish that all of us, to the extent of our abilities, would be involved in some kind of scholarly, creative, or learning project.<br><br>4. I also wish, as I have mentioned above, that we could make a genuinely united effort to help students graduate efficiently.<br><br>5. I wish that we could make continuing efforts to have writing experiences in almost all of our classes. I would also like our classes to include some kind of library activity. In most of our fields, students should expect that the library will join their professors as primary sources of information and learning.<br><br>6. I wish that subject-matter departments would join more fully with the College of Education in the preparation of public school teachers. As a smaller percentage of potential LDS students can attend BYU, one of the best ways to extend our influence is to prepare a large number of teachers who hold our values. But too often we separate subject matter mastery from learning how to teach. Preparing teachers is a venture in which far more of us should participate. I share Alan Keele's vision that all BYU graduates, because they will be teachers in one context or another, should leave here having had some basic experience with teaching.<br><br>7. I wish that we could become more sensitive to those who are different. Our quest for community and unity does not imply that we will ever be exactly the same. It seems apparent that we have become more careful in our conversation and actions, as a whole. But we still hear too many stories of insensitive (and perhaps illegal) questions asked in hiring interviews, careless remarks made in the classroom or hallways, stereotypes perpetuated in recommendations for majors, and lack of understanding shown for special circumstances and disabilities. All of us could probably improve our skills in this respect, but increased goodwill would be an effective beginning point.<br><br>Finally, I wish that we would repent. I don't say this because I feel that we're off track or slipping away from basic principles. I've already said that I believe the current faculty are the best people I have ever had the opportunity to associate with. I say it because of the cleansing and unifying effects of repentance. And I say it under personal motivation. There are probably good reasons why the old hymn, "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing" is no longer in our hymnbook. But there is one line in that song that crosses my mind almost as often as any I have ever sung: "Oh to grace how great a debtor, daily I'm constrained to be." Facing life with my shortcomings, my awkwardness, my coming short of the glory, and my weaknesses would be very difficult had I never experienced the healing power of that change that has been enabled through God's Son. And I've found that couples, families, and groups can likewise be healed. The Book of Mormon and other scriptures even present us examples of repenting communities. I like to imagine this campus if we were to be as the followers of King Benjamin and ask in unity for forgiveness.<br><br>May God bless our university that it may continue to play its important role in furthering his kingdom, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1> Dogmatism and Cynicism in Religious Learning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I first want to express my profound gratitude to Stan Albrecht for his recently concluded service as academic vice president. Stan is an honest and competent person who loves the Lord and this university with a passion. I will miss him. With equal intensity, I welcome Todd Britsch, whose personal gifts and lifelong commitment to BYU have prepared him fully for this day.<br><br>As I think of the relief Stan must be feeling now, I recall a story allegedly told by a former BYU president. When someone asked him if he missed his job at BYU, he answered with this analogy: At a certain stake conference, the stake president was being released after serving faithfully for 10 years, preceded by 10 more years in a bishopric. Just before the Sunday morning session where the stake presidency would be changed, the visiting General Authority became uneasy in watching from the stand as the crowd filled the hall. He leaned over to the devoted but tired stake president and asked, "Are there enough chairs for all those people coming in the back doors?" The stake president whispered back to the visitor, "Who cares?"<br><br>Alma once described Zarahemla in a way that also describes BYU: "We are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings [the gospel] declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard." (Alma 13:23) That blessing would not be possible here without the hundreds of BYU personnel who live lives of conscientious devotion to the Lord, to his Church, and to the well-being of this community. We don't begin to have the problems other large institutions have with drugs, violence, sexual harassment, dishonesty, and other threats to the workplace that are often associated with personal value systems. Yet our high expectations make it doubly tragic when one of us does disappoint our community interests.<br><br>Our aspirations include a commitment to the equal worth of souls in male/female and faculty/staff relationships. To that end, supervisors should go out of their way to listen to women personnel, to see things through their eyes. When supervisors are male, no one should be more sensitive to women's concerns and perceptions than a holder of the priesthood. Regarding mutual support between staff and faculty, it impresses me that BYU has not followed the recent pattern of other universities, whose costs in support areas have risen faster than their academic costs; indeed, Dee Andersen's team has not only achieved new efficiencies, they have helped us move saved resources to accommodate needs outside their area. As I consider all the good people who labor in the Cougar vineyard, I think of Karl G. Maeser's words: "Labor with the hand is as honorable as labor with the head, but labor with the heart, when the heart is pure and true, is the noblest labor" of all.<br><br>This semester we will begin some long-term academic planning. Many of our nonacademic areas are already engaged in regular planning cycles and others may wish to do so. We don't really mean to overrun the campus with day planners--we just want to develop a more coherent idea of what we are doing at BYU. We envision both centralized and decentralized efforts, which the corporate types call "top down" and "bottom up." I prefer a horizontal image, like building the transcontinental railroad, where the administration and the specific units work together toward a coordinated meeting point.<br><h2>Understanding the Purpose of BYU</h2><br>Our first step will be a dialogue within each department and college under the direction of chairs and deans about the purpose of the university. As Paul Pixton has said, the people who are happiest about being at BYU are those who learn why BYU exists. Each faculty group will then review the current state of its disciplines, its academic majors, and begin preparing for our upcoming accreditation self-study. We have tried to outline a conceptual framework for this process during the last three years, as reflected in our past fall conference talks and in some college meetings. In summary, BYU's central mission begins with Richard Bushman's attitude: "I am a believer. I believe in God and Christ and want to know them. My relations with scholarship and scholars have to begin there."<sup>1</sup>And our relations with student activities, support services, and all else we do must also begin there. The first theme flowing from this vision is that we nurture<i>authentic</i>religion. I will return to some thoughts on that subject as my primary topic today. Second, we offer as many spiritually and academically mature students as possible the richest possible learning experience. Third, we support faculty and academic programs that develop our emerging role as a major, national university, positioned in that fruitful middle ground between the comprehensive colleges and the graduate research universities. Fourth, we seek a campus work environment full of professional competence, harmony, and personal nurturing.<br><br>Against this background, let us consider the integration of our religious and professional aspirations. When our very able committee on academic long-range planning met last fall, one person suggested that we begin by reading the teachings of the prophets about the university. Another suggested that we come to our next meeting in an attitude of fasting and prayer. In that very personal kind of mood, each group member expressed his or her impressions after reading these foundation documents. To my surprise, every person around that table expressed a variation on a single theme: We have been too reticent about the place of religion in academic life at BYU. In Marilyn Arnold's words, "The committee could not help wondering why, given the Board's makeup and concerns and the religious devotion of nearly all members of the campus community, this matter had not been widely and vigorously discussed before. Perhaps BYU is just now reaching the maturity that allows it to move, in its quest for academic legitimacy, beyond defensiveness and imitation of established institutions. Of course, we must not relax our efforts at academic excellence, but it is time for us also to become more fully the institution envisioned by the prophets." With these thoughts in mind, the committee has recommended the process that will unfold in each department this fall.<br><h2>Dealing with Sacred and Secular Thought Systems</h2><br>The Jewish author Chaim Potok once distinguished between sacred and secular thought systems.<sup>2</sup>The scholar in a sacred system "assumes there is a design and purpose to nature," because God's spirit "hovers over all creation," giving divine origins to the premises of the sacred system. Thus, even the most sophisticated scholar in a sacred system faithfully transmits "inherited old and acceptable new scholarship" while respecting the established "boundaries of the system" according to a "predetermined choreography." By contrast, the scholar in a secular system always probes and challenges the system's boundaries, believing that all premises originate with man, the exclusive focus of secular systems. In secular systems "It is man who gives, man who takes away."<br><br>Today Potok sees "a boiling cauldron of colliding ideas and worldviews" that makes cultural confrontation between sacred and secular systems unavoidable. He suggests four possible responses for the religious person who faces such confrontation. First--the "lockout" approach: one can simply dodge the conflict by erecting impenetrable barriers between the sacred and the secular and then remaining in just one system. Second--"compartmentalization": one creates separate categories of thought that coexist in a "tenuous peace." Third--take down all walls and allow complete "fusion" in which the sacred and secular cultures freely feed each other, perhaps leading to a "radically new seminal culture." And fourth--"ambiguity": take down most if not all walls and accept a multitude of questions without intending to resolve them.<br><br>BYU's history, purposes, and its very nature reflect fro every angle what Potok calls a sacred system of thought. How then do we handle the natural confrontations between the sacred and our deep commitment to being a serious university? We reject the "lockout" approach that would shut our eyes to life's conflicts and realities. We are in--even though not of--the world. Yet we also cannot accept the total "fusion" model. Although the gospel embraces all truth, we must give priority to the truths that lead us to Christ, and we cannot allow our most sacred premises to be altered or even minimized by secularist assumptions. At the same time, we are too open to be rigid "compartmentalists." So how do we view the "ambiguity" and uncertainty that remain? We don't fear ambiguity's questions, partly because, as John Tanner has said, we approach our questions from an attitude of faith.<br><br>The Restoration actually provides a fifth alternative for integrating sacred and secular thought systems--the model of eternal perspective. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the most comprehensive explanation of life and the cosmos available to humankind. This idea is illustrated by Terry Warner's essay on Alma's teachings to Korihor.<sup>3</sup>Terry wrote that the main difference between Alma's map of the universe and Korihor's map is that Alma's map is broader. If Alma's map is represented by a 10 x 10 square, Korihor's map is a 4 x 4 square within Alma's larger square. Alma doesn't have the answer to every question, but he does see and accept the same scientific evidence that Korhior does. Beyond that, he also recognizes evidence of personal meaning and spiritual reality that Korihor's map by definition excludes. As William James said of this type of evidence, "the agnostic [expression] 'thou shalt not believe without coercive, sensible evidence' is simply an expression of a private, personal appetite for evidence of a certain peculiar kind." Not that these limits are all bad: we really don't want science or the government to tell us the ultimate meaning of our lives--we make those choices personally, based on evidence available outside the limited scientific sphere. Thus we can integrate a secular map into the broader sacred map, but our sacred system cannot be made to fit within the smaller secular map.<br><h2>Both Eyes Open</h2><br>Similarly, Parker Palmer, who recently conducted a valuable seminar for BYU faculty, believes that Western culture's vision of learning suffers from "one-eyed education," teaching the mind but not the heart.<sup>4</sup>"There is an illness in our culture [arising] from our rigid separation of the visible world from the powers that undergird and animate it. . . . That separation [diminishes] life, capping off its sources of healing, hope, and wholeness."<sup>5</sup>He urges us to teach with "wholesight," a complete vision of the world in which mind and heart unite, as Robert Frost put it, "as my two eyes make one in sight." And "the mind's vision excludes the heart, but the heart's vision can include the mind."<sup>6</sup>The aim of wholesighted education, anchored in a heart that guides the mind, is wholeness. In Alan Keele's words, "great theology and great scholarship are not only compatible but are mutually and limitlessly illuminating." Yet, because Alma's vision is the broader one, the gospel should influence our view of our disciplines more than our disciplines influence our view of the gospel.<br><br>Many thoughtful LDS people have enjoyed Chaim Potok's novels because they identify with the conflicts Potok's characters face between sacred and secular systems. The gospel teaches us to take education seriously, but it also teaches us to put the kingdom of God first in our lives. I am acquainted with the spiritual and intellectual biographies of many in this BYU audience and would like to know them all. Each of us, like characters in a Potok story, could recount our personal confrontations between sacred and secular systems of thought. My struggles were typical. I yearned to know if religious literalism is compatible with a fully breathing, stretching life of the mind. I found that the best resolution of the faith vs. reason dilemmas, better than any book or argument of abstract reasoning, is the example of faithful and competent teachers in my own discipline--one of whom was Dallin Oaks--who have answered my questions with their lives. For a generation of LDS scientists, that role model was Henry Eyring. For many LDS doctors, it is Russell Nelson. To know teachers such as these is to be set free from the burden--sometimes the agony--of wondering whether serious religious belief and serious professional or academic commitments can fill the same heart at the same time.<br><br>One of BYU's highest purposes is to help its students--and to help Church members everywhere--confront such questions in ways that strengthen both their minds and their hearts, that they may be fully engaged as productive citizens of both society and the kingdom of God. President David O. McKay once told the BYU faculty that this is "primarily a religious institution, established<i>for the sole purpose</i>of associating with the facts of science, art, literature, and philosophy the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ." In this vision of BYU, students of the highest potential in every discipline may model their lives after teachers here who are the Henry Eyrings and Russell Nelsons in their fields. That is far less likely at state institutions, even with an institute of religion, because--obviously with some important exceptions--the teachers there tend to be oriented primarily to<i>either</i>a sacred<i>or</i>a secular system. Thus, the best way to teach young people who are struggling to find the place of a sacred system in a profane world is to offer them not just theories, but teachers and classmates who have found their own wholesightedness. This opportunity is BYU's unique gift to the youth of Zion.<br><br>Spiritual lives really are at stake in resolving the root questions of faith vs. reason. For that reason, the risk of confusing our students on these issues is the ugly mirror image of our unique capacity for good, as searing and destructive as our positive potential is magnificent. A valued BYU colleague who is a gifted teacher and an inspired researcher of impeccable academic achievement recently told me that increasing numbers of his students are "falling into his foxhole" seeking help from their wounded religious faith. I asked why he thought there would be more spiritual casualties now. Is the world more wicked? Do brighter students see more dilemmas? He said some of the deepest wounds are inflicted when a thoughtful student senses, even through subtle hints, that a BYU teacher she respects is cynical about the Church. That kind of wound can cut to the quick, because it implies to students that the fundamental integration of faith and reason doesn't work, as if in some objective sense it<i>can't</i>work. A BYU student would never draw that conclusion from the cynicism of an agnostic professor in a state university, because he knows that teacher has long been seeing with only one eye. But when someone who the student believes has spent years looking through both eyes implies that the view is darker with the sacred eye open, the message can be devastating.<br><h2>The Dangers of Dogmatism and Cynicism</h2><br>Especially perverse is the teacher who conveys cynicism about the Church as evidence of his commitment to liberal education. That stance can put out both eyes at once, because it may offend believing Church members to the point that they attack liberal education as the cause of cynicism. But liberal education is an essential part of the wholesightedness we seek. Indeed, my own liberal education helps me know that cynicism is as intellectually indefensible as dogmatism. In my own student days, the BYU students who troubled me most were the shallow, religious dogmatists. Now I am just as troubled by the shallow, irreligious cynics who delight in poking fun at "Molly Mormon." The only thing that has changed is the direction of the thoughtless posturing; the superficiality has stayed the same. Neither group has both eyes open. Why would any of us believe we serve the cause of serious education if our primary goal is nothing more than teaching students to "think otherwise" through simplistic posturing and anti-authoritarianism? As Ted Marchese has said, "beware the cynic as well as the huckster."<br><br>Still, one faculty member has urged that we encourage students and each other to engage in public criticism of the Church, because the "courage" involved in "saying unsetting things" will demonstrate that BYU's commitment to liberal education is "indeed working." This argument mistakenly assumes that secular systems are broader than sacred systems. Moreover, there is no connection at all between a superior education and such criticism. Both the educated and the uneducated may be troubled by some Church issue. But whether one expresses those troubles publicly is a function of personal judgment more than it is an expressions of integrity or educational depth. It is also a function of how one understands revealed teachings about publicly challenging those we sustain as prophets. Some defend their public criticism on religious grounds, claiming they must protect the Church from its misguided leaders. The irony in that attitude can't help but convey cynicism about the divine influence in a Church based on prophetic leadership. Conscientious<i>private</i>communication may ultimately be of real help to the Church and its leaders, but<i>public</i>expression by those professing to have both eyes open may simply spray another burst of spiritual shrapnel through the ranks of trusting and vulnerable students.<br><br>Of course, the premises of our sacred system--and, obviously, the premises of sound liberal education--make spiritual and intellectual freedom absolutely crucial for the development of wholesighted education. You can lead a child to a book, but you can't make her read it--much less understand it. Satan's plan to save us without agency<i>could not</i>have worked. Without free inquiry and voluntary action, no understanding, no real testimony and no personal growth is possible. For example, after Aaron taught him the gospel, the converted Lamanite king wanted his people to embrace the gospel as he had. But instead of imposing his new convictions on his subjects, as did Constantine in the apostate era of early Christianity, the king simply asked that the missionaries be allowed to preach freely. As a result, the Lamanites who "were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away." (Alma 23:6) This did not mean, however, that freedom among the people of Aaron and Alma was unlimited. Korihor was initially free to preach his anti-Christian views because there was "no law against a man's belief" in Zarahemla. But when his expression moved from pursuing his own beliefs to the point of "destroy[ing] the children of God," (Alma 30:42) he exceeded the limits of the sacred system.<br><br>I know that some BYU students are too trusting, too reliant on authority figures, and they expect the Holy Ghost to do their thinking for them. We must rouse them from their dogmatic slumbers, teaching them to love the Lord with all their heart, might,<i>mind,</i>and strength. They need education that liberates them from ignorance and superstition, developing the tough-minded independence on which self-reliant people and democratic societies utterly depend. Thus Alma counseled his people to "stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free." and to "trust no man to be a king over you"--and "trust no one to be your teacher." (Mosiah 23:13–14) In other words, of course Hamlet's Ophelia should not expect someone else to tell her what she should think. And beyond doing her own intellectual homework, Ophelia must also, as did Alma, "fast and pray many days<i>that I might know these things of myself."</i>(Alma 5:46).<br><br>But Alma's more complete thought was "trust no man to be your teacher<i>except he be a man of God."</i>(Mosiah 23:14) It is just as important that Ophelia trust the man or woman of God as it is that she not trust authority figures in general. The advantage of having a liberal education in a free society is that no one will tell us what to do. But the<i>disadvantage</i>is that no one will tell us what to do. The rich young ruler who approached the Savior wanted desperately to know what he should do to inherit eternal life. "Master, what shall I do . . . ?" There are two very different meanings to that word, "Master." One is the master of a slave. Another is a teacher in a master-apprentice relationship. The young man approached Christ as an apprentice who fervently<i>needed</i>his master's guidance. As Michael Polanyi wrote, "To learn by example is to submit to authority. You follow your master because you trust his manner of doing things." The hidden rules of his art can be assimilated only if the apprentice surrenders himself to the extent he uncritically imitates the master.<sup>7</sup><br><br>But how can Ophelia know what teacher, what master in the best sense, she should trust? The scriptural standard is, except the teacher is a man or woman of God. Alma "consecrated . . . all their teachers," and "none were consecrated except they were just men [who] did watch over their people, and did nourish them with . . . righteousness." (Mosiah 23:17–18) What an aspiration for all the consecrated people who work at BYU, we who--in and out of the classrooms--teach some of the purest and brightest young men and women in all the world. They fulfill their dreams by coming to this oasis of learning in a spiritually parched world, yearning to ask the young ruler's question: What shall I do? And they come believing that the faculty and staff here will tell them what to do--not only to learn to think for themselves, but what to do to inherit eternal life. Wholesighted teaching, with both eyes open. We move them from dogmatism through healthy skepticism toward a balanced maturity that can tolerate ambiguity without losing the capacity for deep commitment. By example as well as precept, we teach how to ask good--even searching--questions, how to trust, how to know of ourselves. This university's vitality is a continuing witness for the proposition that within the broad gospel framework, robust faith and healthy skepticism are not mutually exclusive. The chosen, consecrated men and women of God who teach and work here live lives that make that clear.<br><br>The ultimate purpose of our integrated teaching model is to teach our students how to live. As Parker Palmer put it, "truth is an approach to living, not just an approach to knowing."<sup>8</sup>Or as we have recently described the purpose of the BYU Jerusalem Center, our purpose is not only to orient our students to the Holy Land, but to orient them to the holy life. How can we do that? Each teacher, faculty or staff, must find his or her own way, and some settings are more natural than others for making connections that help students see how secular interests fit within the larger sacred sphere.<br><br>Of course we can't pursue excessive digressions that waste precious time in classrooms, offices, and workplaces. But many students, such as Amy Baird Miner, tell us that BYU students hunger for "life talks" as well as "grade talks" from their teachers. Joseph K. Nicholes used to love "teaching moments," those unexpected openings when a teacher, a head resident, a job supervisor, or a leader in a student ward senses an opportunity to step back from the subject at hand and open up the bigger picture of life. For example, one student will always remember how a BYU teacher talked soberly about life's larger purposes after witnessing a fatal accident on the way to class. I know a BYU professor who concluded a rigorous course on logic by telling his students, "Now you know the rules of logical analysis. But if you build your testimonies on these rules alone, rather than upon the spirit of God, you are built upon the sand."<br><br>Our university courses are not Sunday School classes, but our fears about that legitimate concern can inhibit some of us more than they should. As President Kimball once said, "Every [BYU teacher should] keep his subject matter bathed in the light of the restored gospel."<sup>9</sup>We must be cautious about both sentimental emotionalism at one extreme and stale academic neutrality on the other. And of course we should teach students to respect rigorous standards of evidence, but let us not neglect all "anecdotal" evidence. Every personal testimony is in a sense anecdotal, but testimonies of personal experience are among the most powerful forms of data.<br><h2>The Value of Scholarship and Religious Loyalty</h2><br>Another risk of integrating sacred and secular systems, especially in scholarly work, is that integrationists sometimes devalue in some lopsided way either the religious or the professional dimension. I have learned firsthand about this problem through the process of writing and publishing articles on family law in scholarly journals. In all of that work, my reasoning has implicitly proceeded from the teachings of the scriptures about marriage and family life. But my interaction with skeptical reviewers and demanding editors quickly taught me that I should avoid the ineffective approaches of shrill pro-family writers who have no idea what it means to observe rigorous research methodologies and to master the available literature. I know of no better example of meaningful scholarly integration than the work of BYU's Allen Bergin, whose work on the place of religious values in psychotherapy recently earned the distinguished service award from the American Psychological Association. He has learned to let his work proceed on a small, empirically based scale that reveals its own conclusions, rather than trumpeting in advance a "moral framework" that implies a preconceived dogmatism. His research speaks for itself when he uses Alma's large map rather than Korihor's small one.<br><br>Following Allen's example in selected disciplines, we should, as Clayne Pope has urged, "work within our disciplines with the additional light of the gospel to inform and direct our work." Our audience for this integrated scholarship is not just BYU or the Church, but also the entire scholarly world--if our work is rigorous enough to satisfy the highest professional standards. Adapting a phrase from James Burtchaell, we can contribute to society in unique and greatly needed ways when our integration is skillful enough to critique the academy from the standpoint of religion, rather than only critiquing religion from the standpoint of the academy.<br><br>A faculty group in one of our academic areas would like to bring Parker Palmer back to the campus to share further his ideas on the spiritual dimensions of teaching. Because I have read Professor Palmer's work, I applaud that interest. It is reassuring to see someone of another faith validate our interest in religious and professional integration. But faculty on our own campus are already doing the nation's finest teaching of that kind--they just haven't written about their work as much as Palmer has, and our reward system should encourage them. It isn't enough just to ask that BYU personnel avoid damaging students' religious faith in the ways described by our new academic freedom statement. When we go beyond that minimal threshold to ask whether someone has contributed enough in citizenship, teaching, and scholarship to warrant continuing faculty status or other special recognition, we look for extensive fulfillment of BYU's aspirations, not merely the absence of serious harm. The university's new policy on advancement and continuing status describes this approach.<br><br>It also matters how job applicants see these issues. I remember interviewing two well-trained applicants for the same position one day. When I asked how each one felt about the Church influence here, one said, "Oh, the Church is no problem for me--I've learned not to let it get to me." The other said, "The Church and the gospel are my whole life. That is why coming to work at BYU would fulfill my lifelong dream." The vast attitudinal difference between these people was, and should be, a major factor in deciding whom to hire. We aren't looking for people who merely tolerate our environment or who will try not to harm it; we seek believing, thoughtful people for whom this is the freest intellectual and spiritual environment in the world.<br><br>Let us consider, finally, the conditions on which our work at BYU may enjoy full access to the revealed truth and prophetic guidance that are the source of our sacred system's life and breath. One of Parker Palmer's favorite stories is about Abba Felix, an early Christian "desert teacher." In this story, "some brothers . . . went to see Abba Felix, and they begged him to say a word to them. But the old man kept silence. After they had asked for a long time, he said, 'There are no more words nowadays. . . . Since [the brothers now] ask without doing that which they hear, God has withdrawn the grace of the word from the old men, and they do not find anything to say, since there are no longer any who carry their words out.' Hearing this, the brothers groaned, saying, 'Pray for us, Abba.'"<sup>10</sup>Felix's point, says Palmer, is that "truth is evoked from the teacher by the obedience of those who listen and learn, and when that quality is lacking in students, the teacher's words are taken away."<sup>11</sup>Felix's students had only been curious. They desired not the words of life--they wanted words that created an illusion of life, while letting them avoid the responsibility of living according to truth.<br><br>This was the same condition on which Ammon taught King Lamoni: "Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things?" (Alma 18:22) Thus at BYU we must "hearken unto the words" of our all-comprehending system if we are to learn its truths and see all else in its bright light. The highest liberal arts tradition teaches a similar concept: hubris. For the ancient Greeks, no sin was greater than the intellectual pride by which the learned thought themselves wiser than divine sources.<br><br>For us, obedience to divine sources first requires that we live a gospel-worthy lifestyle. Further, because ours is a sacred system premised on divinely ordered leadership, each of us must nourish a humble willingness to follow prophetic counsel. The statement by the First Presidency and the Twelve a year ago counseling against<i>any</i>participation in certain kinds of symposia was most unusual, yet very deliberate. Because the statement is for all Church members, it is not primarily a BYU matter--but it clearly speaks to BYU people. It is written in nondirective, nonpunitive terms, but its expectations are clear to those with both eyes open.<br><br>Some Church members and leaders have wondered in recent years if BYU's increasing academic stature would develop at the expense of basic Church loyalties. I don't believe that has happened, and I don't believe it will at today's BYU. I believe with all my heart in Jeffrey Holland's "consuming vision that we [can] be a truly great university [that is] absolutely faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ." But that proposition will constantly be tested, and how we are perceived on an issue as elementary as "follow the Brethren" means more than we might imagine. Tip O'Neill used to say that you find out who your friends are not by seeing who's with you when they agree with you, but who's with you when they think you might be wrong. And the religious core of a sacred system just might ask its followers to trust the religious imperative even when it does not square with their own opinions.<br><br>The BYU dream will forever elude us if, as Abba Felix said, God withdraws the grace of his words from the elders because the young people no longer carry out the teachings of the elders. And even though I believe our collective religious commitment is stronger now than ever before, if a few among us create enough reason for doubt about the rest of us, that can erode our support among Church members and Church leaders enough to mortally wound our ability to pursue freely the dream of a great university in Zion. Somehow we must sense how much is at stake in how we deal with this issue. Pray for us, Abba, because the dream really is ours to fulfill.<br><br>Almost exactly one hundred years ago, when the Church already had several stake academies, including Brigham Young Academy in Provo, the First Presidency released James E. Talmage from heading LDS College in Salt Lake City and assigned him to create the plans for what Talmage's biographer called "a genuine Church university." Talmage was stirred to the core at "the prospect of founding an institution that would merit recognition by the established centers of learning throughout the nation and the world. It was a dream he had cherished for many years."<sup>12</sup>The proposed name: Young University.<br><br>Think of it: Just months after the Manifesto had been issued, the Church barely rescued from the jaws of utter destruction, Utah not yet a state, already a network of Church academies in place, and those Saints in their poverty wanted to create "a genuine university." This early plan was shattered by the Panic of 1893, but the dream lived on. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Church withdrew from higher education, creating a system of institutes of religion and offering to state governments all of its academies but our very own Brigham Young Academy, which the First Presidency determined to keep in order to develop one genuine university. The dream was still alive.<br><br>Sixty years later, the Lord's Church of the 21st century is expanding miraculously all across the globe. Never again will we see a Church-wide network of colleges, but there is still one "genuine Church university" that has demonstrated its capacity to bless and be worthy of<i>all</i>the Saints, every one who pays a dollar of tithing. Some voices in today's winds claim that BYU will never achieve intellectual respectability as long as it is controlled by the Church. But in the 21 years since I joined the faculty, I have watched the faculty, the staff, and the students of this university take an astonishing leap in the quality of their teaching, learning, and scholarship. I can bear firsthand witness that BYU's recent emergence onto the national and international stage is winning the honest admiration of a society desperate for educational leadership because of that society's moral decay and intellectual confusion. And this leadership role is being thrust upon the university not<i>in spite</i>of its lifeline to the Church, but precisely<i>because</i>of it.<br><br>I pay tribute to the thousands of women and men in the BYU community who match and exceed their rich professional achievements with lives of uncompromising faithfulness to the gospel, "offering in sacrifice all that they have for the truth's sake, not even withholding their lives,"<sup>13</sup>because they seek to know the mind and do the will of God.<br><br>The dream of James E. Talmage has become a consuming vision: "a truly great university [that is] absolutely faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ." Its name is Brigham Young University. Pray for us, Abba, for the dream is ours to fulfill. To this end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>y: An Anchor to the Soul - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful time to be a student at Brigham Young University--no matter what<i>Sports Illustrated</i>says. In fact, it's a wonderful time to be a college student anywhere. I am so impressed with the opportunities and privileges that are yours as young adult members of the Church. Never before have young people had so many options available to them, whether you're talking about worldwide travel, higher education, or the opportunity to render meaningful and life-changing service to others.<br><br>As freedom continues to spread throughout the world and the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ rolls forth, great opportunities present themselves to those who are prepared to make a significant contribution. I commend you and congratulate you for preparing yourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that are ahead of you.<br><br>I don't need to tell you that life includes some problems for everyone--whether single, married, or somewhere in between. You should know that the Brethren are aware of some of your challenges. We discuss often the difficulties that young adult members of the Church are facing, and we pray for you. We keep you in our minds and hearts as we formulate policies and programs that affect the young adults of the Church. You must remember that even though the General Authorities may seem old to you, we stay young at heart because we have children and grandchildren who share their concerns with us. We also have auxiliary general boards and your own ward and stake leaders who keep us well informed of your problems and challenges.<br><br>You are our future, and you must be prepared. You are the future leaders of the Church, of government, and of business, and of the professions. Most important, you will be leading your families into the most exciting and, perhaps, most critical time in the history of the Church and of the world.<br><br>This evening, I wish to speak about your future. I pray that I may help you in your preparation for the unique role that each one of you ultimately will play. Have you ever watched a large ship weigh its anchor? It is fascinating to see and hear the massive links of chain screeching against the metal bow of the ship as the anchor is lowered or raised. Now, the metal shanks of the anchor chain are incredibly heavy, but their weight is slight when compared to the total weight of the ship. Still, if an anchor is placed properly on the bottom of the sea, it can hold a giant ship fast, even in rough seas.<br><br>Just as ships need anchors to keep them from drifting away on the open seas, people need spiritual anchors in their lives if they are to remain steadfast and not drift into the sea of temptation and sin. Faith in God and in his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the main anchor we must have in our lives to hold us fast during times of social turbulence and wickedness that seem to be everywhere today. This faith must be more than that of the generic dictionary variety. Our faith, for it to be meaningful and effective and to hold us fast, must be centered in Jesus Christ, in his life, in his atonement, and in the restoration of his gospel to the earth in the last days.<br><br>Recently I spoke to a group of prospective missionaries. Many of those young men and women had made the decision to serve a full-time mission, but others were not certain they should accept a call to serve. I told them that they did not have to decide that night whether or not to go on a mission. But I said they did need to decide whether or not Joseph Smith knelt in the presence of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, "on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty." Listen to Joseph's own words:<br><br><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</i><br><br><i>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</i>[JS-H 1:14–17]<br><br>If this happened to Joseph, then the question of whether or not these prospective missionaries should serve a mission or whether or not they should keep the Lord's commandments faithfully, pretty well takes care of itself, doesn't it? If anyone knows, I mean really knows, that Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to and spoke to Joseph Smith as he said they did, the natural outcome of that knowledge should kindle a strong desire to serve God and his Holy Son all the days of his or her life.<br><br>Nothing is more remarkable or important in this life than to know that God our Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, have spoken again from the heavens and have called prophets and apostles to teach the fullness of the everlasting gospel once again upon the earth. That is a glorious thing to know. When you know it, that knowledge affects your life. It influences every major decision you make. It changes the course of your life to a safer one because it provides an anchor that helps hold you fast to the teachings of the gospel despite the evil influences all around you that entice you to drift toward sin and transgression.<br><br>I make the same argument for the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood through John the Baptist and the Melchizedek Priesthood through Peter, James, and John. Let's be very plain about this. Either the priesthood of God has been restored or it has not. When you know that it has, you have secured your spiritual anchor even more firmly against the turbulence and storms of life.<br><br>Similarly, either the Book of Mormon is the word of God and is another testament of Jesus Christ or it is not. Either it is the record of the Lord's dealings with the people on the American continent from 600 B.C. to A.D. 421 or it is not. Either it is a translation from gold plates completed by Joseph Smith under divine guidance or it is not. The issue is that simple and that profound. If the Book of Mormon is, in fact, the word of God, as I testify that it is, then the question of whether or not we should apply its principles and teachings in our own lives is already decided, isn't it?<br><br>The same simple test applies to our living prophets and apostles today. President Ezra Taft Benson is either a prophet of God in every sense, in every way, or he is not.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, it really is no more complicated than that. If we know these things to be true, we really have no question about how we should live and what we should do with our lives. If we know that we are anchored to "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth," our course is clear (see D&amp;amp;C 1:30). What a marvelous blessing to know this.<br><br>You know how to find out for yourselves if these things are true because you understand the first principles of the gospel. Because you have an anchor of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you understand that you must pray to receive your personal testimony. You understand that the Holy Ghost "shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26). When you know and live these simple truths, they will be a spiritual anchor to help you keep your own life from being "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine" (Ephesians 4:14).<br><br>Becoming firmly grounded to these simple truths and focusing your attention on the lessons of eternity will keep your life moving in the right direction at all times and in all situations, regardless of which way the winds of current worldly trends may be blowing.<br><br>Ella Wheeler Wilcox made this observation while she was a passenger on a steamship and noticed that one ship went west and another east in the same wind:<br><br><i>One ship drives east and another drives west</i><br><i>With the self-same winds that blow;</i><br><i>'Tis the set of the sails</i><br><i>And not the gales</i><br><i>That tells them the way to go.</i><br><br><i>Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate</i><br><i>As we voyage along through life;</i><br><i>'Tis the set of the soul</i><br><i>That decides its goal</i><br><i>And not the calm or the strife.</i><br>["The Winds of Fate," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in<i>World Voices</i>(New York: Hearst's International Library Company, 1916), p. 51]<br><br>Many of you are just starting another school year and are working toward degrees in a variety of disciplines: the arts, science, medicine, law, humanities, business, language, engineering, and computers, for example. These ambitions and goals are praiseworthy and admirable and, when you graduate, will put you in a position to do much good in the world. But the most important knowledge you can acquire, and the area of learning that will keep everything else in focus for you and bring you true happiness and joy, will be your solid anchor of assurance that you are a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>The word<i>disciple</i>comes from the Latin word<i>discipulus;</i>it means to learn or to know. Many people think that being a disciple means simply to follow, with an unfortunate connotation of following blindly. Becoming a true disciple is nothing of the sort! It requires us to learn and to know of Jesus Christ, to study the principles of truth for ourselves and to receive answers--in other words, to receive knowledge. Because President Benson knows this, he has called upon Church members to study the scriptures every day. Once we have knowledge of the simple principles of the Restoration, coupled with a deep and abiding faith in the truths we do not yet know, we become true disciples of Jesus Christ and not simply followers. The difference between a disciple and a follower is like the difference between a ship's anchor that is lodged solidly at the bottom of the sea, holding the ship fast, and an anchor that is merely suspended in water because the chain is too short. Such an anchor may appear to be doing its job when the seas are calm, but serves no purpose during storms or high waves. Remem-ber these words from the prophet Nephi:<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20]<br><br>Every great prophet--including those in the Old Testament, the New Testament, or the Book of Mormon--has had to go through the process of becoming a true disciple by coming to an unshakable knowledge of Christ. Each one has had to ask himself, just as I have asked you to ask yourselves tonight, "Is Jesus Christ the Son of God, our Eternal Father?" "Does he live and does he preside over his Church today?"<br><br>The sure knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the World provided the courage for Meshach, Shadrach, and Abed-nego to enter a fiery furnace without fear. Abinadi's knowledge of Christ gave him the power to testify of Christ while being burned to death by the wicked priests of King Noah. The same knowledge that Christ lives gave Nephi the power to endure the incessant insults of his brothers and gave him the strength to suffer until his brothers broke the strong cords that held him bound during a tumultuous storm at sea. Having come to know Christ, Elijah had the power to literally command fire to consume his soggy altar while the priests of Baal watched in awe. An absolute conviction that Jesus Christ is the Messiah gave Samuel the Lamanite the courage to stand on the city wall and bear testimony to the wicked Nephites and to receive protection from their arrows and stones. The brother of Jared was even able to move the mountain Zerin because he knew in his heart of hearts that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God! The scriptures are filled with righteous acts and testimonies of men and women who care to know for themselves that Jesus is the Christ.<br><br>That same sure testimony of Jesus can be yours because the gospel has been restored in its fullness in the last days. Testimony and knowledge come as a result of your personal faith and prayers. Ask your Heavenly Father to bless you with faith and courage, and he will help you endure any challenges you may face. He will help you overcome loneliness, feelings of desperation and hopelessness, setbacks of a personal, emotional, financial, and even spiritual nature. He will strengthen you when you are simply feeling overwhelmed by all of the demands for your time and attention. He will give you the ability to serve faithfully in every assignment you receive from your local Church leaders. Your faith and your knowledge of the restoration of the gospel will give you the strength to be faithful and true to the covenants you have made with the Lord and to share your strengths and talents gladly to build up the kingdom of God here on the earth.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, your testimony of Jesus Christ is the most important anchor that you can have to help hold you steadfast and immovable to principles of righteousness, regardless of the challenges and temptations that may come in the future.<br><br>The Book of Mormon prophet Ether explained this principle to the people of his day. From the twelfth chapter of Ether we read:<br><br>[Ether]<i>could not be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.</i><br><br><i>For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance lest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things are fulfilled--</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith,</i>maketh an anchor to the souls of men,<i>which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</i>[Ether 12:2–4; emphasis added]<br><br>The principle is clear. We believe, we hope, we have faith, we act upon that faith by "abounding in good works," and we have an attitude of glorifying God. Then we shall, indeed, have a place at the right hand of God.<br><br>Now let's step back and take a look at this from a little broader perspective. As each of you receives the education and the degree for which you are working and becomes successful in your chosen field of endeavor, whether within or outside of the home--all the while remaining disciples of Christ--think what a light you will be for those around you. Many are lost because they do not have a spiritual anchor of any kind to hold them secure when buffeted by the worldly waves and wind. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it" (<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 145–46).<br><br>Those of our Father's children who know that through Joseph Smith the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored are most blessed. With this precious knowledge comes a duty to prepare ourselves spiritually to serve God and our fellowmen.<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, please understand that the future of the Church will be yours and that you must do your part to help people turn their hearts to God. You can be the antidote to much of the moral decline in America and the world! You who have testimonies of the restored gospel, you who know the true nature of God, you who have the light of the Holy Ghost within you can be a spiritual lighthouse to the people of the world. You can be like a life preserver that people who are drowning in their own spiritual ignorance can grasp and cling to until they find safety within their own testimonies of Christ.<br><br>We know that we cannot look to the government, to the Church, or even to our own families to save us because we can be saved ultimately only through our own individual good works and our own testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Creator of the Universe, and that his gospel has been restored through Joseph Smith with the priesthood and the ordinances that will provide eternal life to the faithful.<br><br>A fervent personal testimony of Christ and his Church often comes in simple ways. From my own experiences, I can testify of this. I accepted a call to go to England on a mission when I was nineteen. Because of my missionary experience, I became anchored to a testimony of the reality of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I stood in Hyde Park and on many other street corners in the British Isles and bore my testimony that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, that the gospel had been restored in its fullness, and that the priesthood and authority to bless mankind is once again upon the earth. The more I bore my testimony, the more it became a part of me.<br><br>After I returned home, my testimony gave me the direction and the faith I needed to find the girl of my dreams, who would support me in my Church callings and in all my duties and help me live the teachings of the gospel. My sweetheart of over forty-one years, Barbara, is here with me tonight, and I publicly thank the Lord for her.<br><br>My understanding of the gospel has given me guidance on the kind of father and now grandfather I should be. My testimony, gained in my youth, has helped me respond to every call in the Church, including this current overwhelming call to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. My testimony, obtained a long time ago on the street corners of England, has grown line upon line and precept upon precept until I can stand before you tonight, my dear young friends, and testify as a special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ that our Savior lives and he is the Son of God our Eternal Father. My life has never been the same since I anchored my soul to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, let's return for a moment to the analogy of the ship's anchor, especially the massive anchor chain. Suppose a beautiful sailing ship had been manufactured from the finest materials and had been reinforced and strengthened for the roughest seas. The mast and sails had been prepared carefully and were sturdy and seaworthy. Suppose the anchor was above standard in size and weight and craftsmanship. But, suppose, by some inadvertent error, the chain attached to the anchor was inferior and weak. Visualize what would happen the first time the anchor was lowered, or the first time a strong wave tried to push the anchored ship out to sea. If any link of the chain holding the anchor broke, the anchor would be left to rust on the bottom of the ocean floor and the ship would drift and perhaps be destroyed.<br><br>The comparison to our lives is plain. The links in our chain of faith and testimony that enable our personal anchor to keep us safe and secure are the simple doctrines and teachings of the gospel. For example, can you see the value of the gospel link of personal prayer? Those of you who are single can kneel in a quiet and private place and pray for guidance before you leave your home and after you return each day. If you are married, you can join hands with your spouse and take turns offering companion prayers. Thanking your Heavenly Father for your blessings will help you remain secure. Pray for the help you need in your personal life, your education, your career, and your relationships. You students must know that the Lord will help you understand calculus and economics as surely as he will help you understand the principles of the gospel if you ask him after doing all that you can on your own.<br><br>Can you see another gospel link in your chain being the Word of Wisdom? By faithfully living the Lord's law of health, that link in the chain will help you keep your physical bodies strong. At the same time, you "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" that will help you be more committed to the Church (see D&amp;amp;C 89:19).<br><br>Another link is the law of tithing. You understand, I believe, that paying a full tithe is not a matter of money; it is a matter of faith. You can pay a full tithe regardless of your income if you develop the faith to do so. The Lord surely will "open the windows of heaven" as he has promised to those who are obedient to this commandment (see Malachi 3:10 and 3 Nephi 24:10).<br><br>How about the links of honesty, moral purity, service to others, attendance at Church meetings, and studying the scriptures, to name just a few? These links of your gospel anchor chain may seem somewhat elementary, but they are as important as the anchor of faith and testimony itself. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. We must take care every day to examine our own personal chain to anchor our souls to the gospel and see if we have any weak links that may make us vulnerable to the influences of the devil.<br><br>One good way to keep every link strong is to partake of the sacrament each week. As you know, the sacrament is a renewal and a reminder of all our covenants with the Lord. What a great time for personal introspection and reflection on our life during the past week. Make the sacrament a time to review your personal gospel chain and see if each link is equal to the task of anchoring you securely to the Church.<br><br>Last of all, for those of you who have been temple endowed, doing temple work will keep this link strong. The temple is the house of the Lord. Take the time to go as often as you can to feel the presence of Heavenly Father and his Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>My dear young brothers and sisters, your personal chain that anchors your soul to the gospel can be as strong as you want to make it through a daily review of your life. Be grateful for the principle of repentance, which provides the way for us to strengthen any weak links in our personal chain. Be worthy and at peace within yourself. If you know that you are anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ but still feel like life's trials are more than you can handle, find peace and strength in the knowledge that each day you have done the best you can in honoring the Lord. Remember that strengthening your testimony is a lifelong process. Never become discouraged and overwhelmed. Look to the Lord for strength to overcome discouragement and hopelessness. Work on one link at a time and strengthen each until you can feel anchored safely and securely to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I am reminded of what Helaman said to his sons, Nephi and Lehi, some thirty years before Christ was born:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, we cannot fall if we are anchored securely to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and if we forge strong links in an anchor chain that will hold us fast to the sure and simple principles of the gospel.<br><br>Repentance is a great blessing that our Father has given to us. Use it if you need to. And I promise you, in the name of the Lord, that as you honestly deal with yourself in those quiet moments and resolve to strengthen any link in your gospel anchor chain that needs your attention, you will find that strength.<br><br>Now, in closing, I think many of you who are here in the Marriott Center and in the stake centers hearing our broadcast feel it would sure be nice to get to the point where Brother Ballard is where you don't have any worries. Let me tell you, and put your mind at ease, at least about this apostle. I better not speak for all of my associates. We've all had our challenges. I've certainly had mine. I've had my challenges and disappointments. I've had those moments of feeling somewhat desperate--when I was in business and decisions seemed to go against me, and I wondered why. I've had health struggles, as perhaps many of you have. But all of the challenges, if we handle them right, staying solidly anchored to the Master, we can manage.<br><br>Years ago I took a young man to meet President Kimball. He said he had given up hope, that he didn't believe there was a God anymore because his mother had passed away with cancer. He loved his mother, and he said to the president, "If there really was a God, he never would have let my mother suffer and die as she did."<br><br>Then President Kimball, in that wonderful sweet way of his, put his hands on the shoulders of my nineteen-year-old friend and said, "My boy, your mother is all right. Sit down, and let's talk about you."<br><br>Then he taught him in a beautiful way. One of the things he taught that I shall never forget ties to this matter of strengthening your anchor chain. He said, "My boy, I've had a lot of health challenges. I had cancer of the throat. I've had my body opened from here to here with open-heart surgery in my mid-seventies. I've had all kinds of challenges healthwise." Then he looked at my friend and at me and said, "And through my suffering I have come to know God."<br><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, you do face and will face challenges. You did not come here thinking that you were going to pass through this experience without difficulties and challenge. I promise you in the name of the Lord, and bless you, by and through the holy apostleship invested in me, if you will remain unwaveringly anchored to the Lord Jesus Christ and devote your heart and soul to him, and if you've made mistakes if you will come unto him and give away your sins through the principle of repentance and commit to serve him and honor him all the days of your life, you will be blessed and all of the promises of the eternities will be given unto you. That I know.<br><br>How grateful we are for every one of you. You are precious to the Church. You are precious to your families. You are precious to the countries of your origins.<br><br>I invoke a blessing also that you may have strength come to you now, that as you study at whatever university you are attending you will prepare yourselves to take up the labors of the sons and daughters of God who know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has restored the church and kingdom of God to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>With that knowledge, my beloved young friends, go forward now, bless this great world that you live in. Bless your associates. Bless your families. And may all of the peace and joy and happiness be yours because of your faithfulness, I humbly pray in the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>e: Crossing the Street of Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Rex and I warmly welcome you back to this beautiful fall semester. Now that you are somewhat settled in your classes and are just about finished adding and dropping, we hope that your frustrations are beginning to subside. We have two students of our own at BYU who have given their father plenty of advice about how to make things run more smoothly. So by next semester, registration should be a piece of cake.<br><br>I have been thinking a lot about your happiness lately, about how to obtain it and how to hold onto it. I have come up with a foolproof method. Let me begin with this story.<br><br>My niece Mollie was playing at her grandmother's house one day when she asked if she could cross the street to visit a favorite aunt. The street was not a busy one, but because Mollie was only four, she was cautioned to look carefully both ways before crossing. Always an inquisitive child, she questioned this procedure, so her grandmother replied, "Such a little girl could easily get hit by a car, and I love you so much that I don't want anything to happen to you."<br><br>Before long Mollie was back: "You lied to me! You said I would get hit by a car if I didn't look both ways. Well, I closed my eyes and ran over and back lots of times, and a car never hit me, so you didn't tell me the truth!"<br><br>Today I would like to talk about obedience--specifically, obedience to the Lord's commandments. Just as a loving grandmother cautioned a four-year-old child to look both ways before crossing the street, a loving Father in Heaven has given us detailed instructions to ensure our happiness and safe arrival at our ultimate destination. Yet we often question the consequences or think we can get away with taking chances. We close our eyes to some of God's commandments and cross the street of life. At such times it appears that we might not get hurt if we obey only some of God's laws. Our minds don't comprehend answers to some of the "whys" of the commandments and, like questioning children, we disobey. The Lord has said, "Keep my commandments." He didn't say, "Look this list over, pick out what you think pertains to you or try to work on part of these some of the time." His instructions were simple, yet direct and unqualified: "Keep my commandments."<br><br>My three-year-old granddaughter Jordan asks "why" after almost everything I say. I recognize her need to understand, and I explain as much as possible. But there are occasions when no amount of explaining can penetrate her level of understanding. And so it is with us. Our mortal minds are limited, but the Lord is limitless in his understanding. How tedious it must become when we continue to question what we cannot comprehend. Many of God's commandments are clearly seen as being worthy of our obedience, but often the consequences of our actions are not immediately visible and our obedience requires some faith. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said:<br><br><i>Obedience, among other things, provides us with a grace period. During this period, we go forward out of a sense of duty, doing what we should do before we have all the answers as to why.</i><br><br>Many of us wish we could counsel with the Lord concerning situations in our lives. What we sometimes fail to realize is that we can! We have been given personalized counsel in the form of a perfect road map detailed specifically for us in ancient scripture and modern-day revelation. Just tune in to general conference in a couple of weeks. You will be astounded at the solutions to your own problems that you will hear from the Lord's chosen leaders.<br><br>We have also been given the ultimate visual aid. The Savior's life is the perfect example for us to follow. As a teacher I am constantly amazed at the variety of methods our Heavenly Father uses to instruct his children. How well he understands that each of us learns in different ways. And if our footsteps falter, we again have been given divinely directed instructions. Because of the Atonement, and through our own repentance, we are welcomed back to the pathway of righteousness.<br><br>Tucked inside our own personal road map, we have been given a promise concerning our willingness to follow the commandments of the Lord. We are told that the Lord is bound when we do what he says. And then we are given a caution. When we do not do what he says, we have no promise (see D&amp;amp;C 82:8–10).<br><br>It is pretty clear, isn't it? We cannot afford to be selectively obedient. We need to be steadfastly obedient. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told, "When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:21).<br><br>If we are willing to put our trust in the Lord and keep his commandments, we have been promised that we will be blessed. The blessing might not come in the form of straight A's, having a date every Friday night, or inheriting a lot of money. But we will grow in capacity, experiencing joy along the way as we keep more and more of the commandments and eventually become prepared for a celestial existence.<br><br>We must understand that "God is not arbitrary. He is not anxious to punish his unruly children or burden them with unnecessary commandments. Rather, he is a loving parent who wants his children to avoid the negative consequences of breaking eternal laws. He wants them to receive the promised blessings of complying with righteous principles" ("Obedience: A Matter of Love," Spiritual Living Lesson 7, Relief Society Personal Study Guide 1 [Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1989], p. 40).<br><br>The catch in all of this is that our level of obedience determines the outcome. Whether we are studying music or microbiology, we all know that success hinges on how thoroughly we study or how hard we practice. Does it really surprise us that God operates in this cause-and-effect manner when all around us we see the results that come from following natural law? Perhaps natural laws were given to us as an example to follow.<br><br>Douglas Smoot, dean of the College of Engineering and Technology, explains, "It is impossible to leap from the top of a building and disobey the law of gravity. Placing one's finger in an electric outlet will cause an electrical flow through a person's body irrespective of intent. . . . Fundamental laws of nature cannot be disobeyed."<br><br>I thought about Dean Smoot's comments and about how we as humans constantly try to push the laws of nature as well as the laws of God when I read what happened to a young man a few days ago who was celebrating his twenty-fifth birthday at a Salt Lake hotel. He and his friends had been drinking and were probably not thinking clearly when the boy celebrating his birthday decided to jump from one tenth-floor balcony to the next. He made the first leap, but not the second. "We were just out having a good time," said his friend, "[but now] I realize how quickly life can be taken away."<br><br>I use this tragic story to illustrate what happens when our judgment is impaired and we refuse to obey the laws God has given us--both physical and spiritual. In this case, the consequence of leaping from one balcony to the other--that high up--seems pretty obvious to me. But there will be times when we will feel physically or spiritually impaired and will not realize what could happen if we choose to disobey or if we walk too close to the edge of disobedience. Why is it that we sometimes question, as Mollie did, the preliminary warning or instruction given to help avoid the next crucial brush with something that could cause us harm? If only we could realize that the momentary pleasure we might feel by an act of disobedience can never be equal to the feelings of peace and happiness that result from obedience.<br><br>Joseph Smith assured us, "As God has designed our happiness--and the happiness of all His creatures, He never has--He never will institute an ordinance or give a commandment to His people that is not calculated in its nature to promote that happiness which He has designed" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 256).<br><br>Sometimes we are tempted to test the law, as Mollie did, and even question the wisdom of the lawgiver. We may feel that we find freedom in disobedience as we dash across life's highway with our eyes closed. But, as Elder Boyd K. Packer has said,<br><br><i>Obedience--that which God will never take by force--he will accept when freely given. And he will then return to you freedom that you can hardly dream of--the freedom to feel and to know, the freedom to do, and the freedom to</i>be,<i>at least a thousandfold more than we offer him. Strangely enough, the key to freedom is obedience.</i>["Obedience," Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year (Provo, 7 December 1971), p. 4]<br><br>That we may find fulfillment and joy through obedience, that we may see the relationship between happiness and obedience, that we may understand that we are exercising our free agency in the most effective way by choosing to be obedient to all that is outlined on God's road map leading to our eternal destiny is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E. Lee, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 15 September 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ies, Replenishment, Environmentalism, Ownership - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I want to talk to you about the ownership of BYU. Who owns BYU, and what does this ownership mean? What are the privileges of ownership, and what are its responsibilities?<br><br>If you look at it just from a dollars-and-cents standpoint, by far the largest financial interest in this university is held by the faithful tithe payers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their interests, and the interests of the Church in general, are represented by our policy-making body, the members of the board of trustees, the majority of whom we also sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. Similarly large stakeholders are those of us who devote our full-time efforts and energy to the policies that our trustees formulate: the faculty, staff, and administrators.<br><br>But the trustees, the tithe payers, and the professionals who serve BYU full-time are not its only owners. The principal theme I want to develop with you today is that every one of you also has an important ownership interest in Brigham Young University. You acquired your shares of stock the moment you made the decision to enroll here as students. It is an ownership that will last as long as you live. And in the case of many of you, it will endure beyond the time of your mortal deaths--for years, decades, and, for some, even centuries.<br><br>Now, lest you become completely carried away with this newly discovered and exalted status, let me point out that some of the rights of ownership are not yours to exercise. For example, even by majority vote you could not cut tuition in half, or eliminate the general education requirements, or replace the president, or prohibit broccoli or Y Sparkle from being served in the Cougareat, or declare that 90 percent of the parking spaces are to be reserved exclusively for student use. In short, you are not absolute owners, but you do have an important ownership interest. Your relationship to this university is more than that of consumer to supplier, and even more than learner to teacher. I submit that it occupies a broader spectrum of interests than is true of the relationship of student to university in any other school, and what you will get out of that relationship depends in large part on your understanding the nature of your ownership interest.<br><br>Let me review, therefore, some of the great benefits, including financial benefits, that each of us who has had the good fortune to be a student at BYU enjoys because of our shareholder status.<br><br>As is the case with other owners, the worth of your interest is tied directly to the value of BYU's stock. Over thirty years ago, when I was about to receive my BYU degree, I began applying to law schools. Without exception, they were very good law schools. It was at that time that the value of a BYU degree and a BYU education were first brought home to me in ways that were not only pleasing, but actually put money in my pocket. My classmates, who were also applying to professional schools or other graduate programs, had the same experience. We were in demand, and a major contributing factor was our BYU diploma. The only change in that circumstance from then to now is that things have gotten better as our university and its diplomas have increased in quality, visibility, and prestige. I believe that in many quarters, the fact that we incorporate values as an integral part of our total learning process contributes positively to the worth of those diplomas.<br><br>There is another finite benefit that each of you enjoys, and this one is even more measurable in dollars and cents. Every time you register, each of you receives an automatic scholarship. The amount of that scholarship is a little more than twice the amount of the tuition you pay. For those of you who receive what we officially call a scholarship, the amount is even greater. But whatever the amount, it is true today, as it has been for decades, that for every one of us who has been admitted to study at BYU, about 70 percent of the cost of our education is paid by direct appropriations from the Church--from tithing donations made by faithful members throughout the world. I believe it is a good investment for the Church to make, both in terms of its impact on individual lives and also in preparing and developing the future membership and leadership of the Church.<br><br>And so as owners you enjoy some very substantial, and tangible, benefits. There are also some corresponding responsibilities of ownership. The first of those that I want to discuss relates directly to these built-in scholarships that each of you receives, amounting to almost $5,000 a year for each one of you. One of the mainstays of our doctrine and of our historical tradition ties back to helping others who come after us, just as we have been helped by those who have gone before. The Perpetual Emigrating Fund, which permitted many of the early Saints to come to Zion, is a very relevant example: Those whose journey west was made possible by the fund participated in replenishing it after they arrived. A similar example is provided by another practice of our pioneer forebears, who planted crops in Winter Quarters and other places along the Mormon Trail to be harvested by later companies who would in turn do their own planting for those who followed them. Those examples and many others represent a pattern and practice whose merits are extolled throughout the scriptures, from the Savior's teaching about loving our neighbor as ourselves to King Benjamin's classic observation that when we are in the service of our fellow beings, we are only in the service of our God. Over the past two or three years the officers of our Alumni Association have taken the lead in emphasizing that this general concept--flowing from the Perpetual Emigrating Fund and other historical Mormon practices-- is also relevant to BYU students and alumni of today. The word that they have chosen to use is<i>replenishment.</i>I hope we will add both the word and the concept to our vocabulary and to our perspective. As Elder Robert L. Simpson often quoted: "We have all drunk from wells we did not dig, and warmed ourselves by fires we did not build." Having drunk from BYU's well, we have a lifelong opportunity and obligation for the continuing quality of the well itself.<br><br>So what does this mean in terms of what you ought to be doing now and what you should be thinking of doing in the future?<br><br>Fourteen years ago at a forum assembly, Professor Clayne Pope, now one of our associate academic vice presidents, observed that a basic principle of economics teaches that while nothing matters very much, everything in fact matters some. It is one of those things that has stuck with me, and I have thought about it a lot since I heard him say it.<br><br>I am reminded also of the view of Edward Lorenz, a meteorologist who teaches that it is impossible to make long-range weather predictions because there are so many variables. He contends, for example, that a Brazilian butterfly beating its wings in Brazil has an effect on air movements that, together with other currents, affect the weather in Texas. Accordingly, he asserts that in order to accurately predict long-range Texas weather conditions, one would need to measure, among other things, each flap of a butterfly wing weeks in advance. What is the practical significance of this? Professor Paul Carrington, one of the nation's leading scholars, suggests as follows:<br><br><i>Lorenz does not of course imply that butterflies or men and women should despair of being useful. His observation should be taken as encouragement to men and women, and to any butterflies that read, to do what they can and not what they cannot.</i><br><br>Now let's bring that down to us. As participants in BYU's ongoing learning process, there are things that you can do. Each of you can make a difference. The flapping of your individual wings makes a difference. Financial replenishment over the long run is one example of what I am talking about. But beyond that, to whatever extent you are a better student, learning more, and strengthening your testimony during your years here, BYU will be a better institution, and all of its owners will be better off because of your individual effort.<br><br>Another difference you can make is in preserving and enhancing our environmental quality. I am not talking here about air contamination (though if some of you can find a way to get along without a car, that would certainly help). Rather, the environment of which I speak now is the intellectual, moral, and spiritual environment that is so much a part of our school and so essential to its uniqueness and its strength. This place really is different. We are different in part because the range of values we pursue here is broader than at other colleges and universities. But we are also different from many other schools because we really care about such things as honesty, morality, modesty, and a clean, healthy, attractive physical appearance. Those kinds of values--regarded as none of anyone else's business at most universities--lie right at the core of what a BYU education is all about. The contribution that each of you as an owner can make to those environmental qualities is one of the most important reasons that each student should have an interest in implementing and strengthening the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards, particularly those provisions that relate to honesty and morality.<br><br>In recent decades, the people of the United States of America have invested enormous amounts of effort and attention, and literally hundreds of billions of dollars, in the preservation and enhancement of our physical environment. And properly so. At BYU we believe in environmental enhancement of the traditional sort, and we, too, have invested large amounts of time and money toward that end. But we are also environmentalists in a broader sense. We are concerned about our total campus environment, including the cleanliness and appearance of not only our buildings and grounds, but of our people as well. Our Honor Code and Dress and Grooming Standards are key to that environmental effort. So also is every single shareholder. It is<i>our</i>honor code, and it will work only as successfully as we, the BYU owners, are determined to make it work.<br><br>Another thing that you can do, consistent with your BYU ownership and your effort to make yourself more valuable, is to make it possible for a larger number of people to have the opportunity for a BYU education. Of all the challenges we face, none causes me quite so much anguish as the ever-increasing number of highly qualified, worthy applicants whom we cannot admit to study here.<br><br>For very good reasons, which I not only understand but fully support, the board of trustees has determined that our enrollment cannot continue to grow commensurate with the membership of the Church and should therefore be stabilized at 27,000 students. In case you had not heard, I will tell you that the Church's enrollment has not been frozen. The days are gone forever when any person who wants the unique kind of experience that BYU offers and is willing to abide by our standards can be admitted. According to our projections, the number of qualified, worthy applicants who will not be accepted for admission will just about triple between now and 1998. The increase will be from about 2,200 per year to about 6,600 per year.<br><br>Those numbers, all by themselves, are sobering enough. But they convert into a source of acute sorrow when you realize that behind each one of them is a real human being, many of whom have suffered profound disappointments. Of the many letters we receive each year, let me read you parts of just one, which was addressed to our dean of Admissions, Erlend Peterson:<br><br><i>My daughter Jennifer</i>[not her real name, but the one I will use to preserve her anonymity]<i>received her letter from your office denying her application for admittance to BYU. It was hard for me and her mother to watch the tears well up in her eyes knowing that all she had worked so hard for during the last four years had come to naught. Though unexpressed to us, I know the humiliation she will have to face telling her five other friends, all of whom were accepted to the Y, that she will not be joining them as one of their roommates as they had all planned. . . .</i><br><br><i>Life is not always fair, and Jennifer will have to deal with this setback like she has on many other occasions. . . . I am just sorry you won't get to know her.</i><br><br>Actually, there is something you can do that will significantly shrink the number of Jennifers to whom we are not able to offer a BYU educational experience. Consider this. The average number of semesters that BYU students currently take to graduate is 11.8. Missionary service does not enter into that calculation--11.8 is the number of semesters actually enrolled. That's almost six years for what we have always referred to as a four-year program. If we could, in fact, get that average back down to four years, from twelve semesters to eight, we would increase by one-third the number of students whom we could admit--who could have a BYU education--and all without any change in the enrollment ceiling. That would mean that thousands more of the people who desire to be here could come.<br><br>The reasons that it takes an average of six years instead of four to obtain a BYU degree are multiple and complex. Some of them you have no control over because their solutions lie within the stewardship of the faculty and administration. We are going to do what we can. But several of the factors that contribute to our twelve semester average are within your control, and I urge you to give them some serious attention. Remember the Brazilian butterflies. What you as an individual can do may not be much, but it is something; and when aggregated with what others are doing, the increment can be significant.<br><br>When you make your decisions, therefore, on such issues as how many hours to take each semester, whether to attend spring and summer terms, and whether to change your major for the fifth time, make those decisions not just in light of your own personal, immediate interests. Please take into account also your interests as an owner of BYU itself. Be aware of the Christlike opportunity that is yours to share your blessings with other people who but for your thoughtfulness and consideration might never be able to come here. As long as you occupy your seat in the theater, someone else who would like to see the show cannot get in.<br><br>And so concludes my semiannual report to shareholders. Your stock is valuable. It is a growth stock, and it will almost certainly increase in value in the years to come. Unlike other shareholder situations, there are specific, identifiable things that you can do to increase the worth of your ownership interest.<br><br>We are so pleased that you are here. Janet and I wish we could get to know each of you personally. We can't, but we look forward to those personal relationships that we can and will have. With you, we also look forward to the excitement, the joys, the frustrations, the learning, and the growth that will be a necessary part of the year that lies before us. I have an optimism that 1992–93 may be the best year BYU has ever had. We have it in our power to make it the best. Certainly we are off to an amazing start. This year's freshman class has shown greater energy, greater enthusiasm, and greater desire to succeed than any in my memory. That we may all capitalize on the head start they have helped to give us is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>d Accountability - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I cannot understand how I agreed to come here today. We have just concluded a general conference of the Church and a number of associated meetings. I am hoarse from speaking and feel drained of things to speak about.<br><br>On Thursday, day after tomorrow, I leave for London for a regional conference to be followed by the rededication of the London Temple and then the rededication of the Swiss Temple. There will be dedicatory prayers and many talks to be given in the numerous dedicatory sessions that will be held.<br><br>How did I ever agree to come here today? I ask myself. Do you have the same problem that I have? Someone asks you to do something far in advance, and you agree without really thinking of what that will entail. Then, when the day is upon you, you doubt your capacity, you worry, you ask why you ever agreed, and you pray for inspiration and enlightenment to fulfill your commitment.<br><br>I guess we all have such experiences. We hope they turn out well.<br><br>I am reminded of an incident of a long time ago when a friend came to see me. He was to be married in the temple in two days. He had been going with his fiancée for many months. She was a wonderful girl--beautiful and able. He had proposed. She had accepted. And they had set the wedding date. All went wonderfully until a few days before when he began to think of how long eternity is. For some unexplainable reason, he began to doubt and to wonder. He came to me frantic with worry.<br><br>I said to him, "Come on, Jim. You have known Mary for three years. This has been no sudden courtship. She is a wonderful girl. You know it, and I know it. Put your doubts out of your mind. Trust in the Lord, and trust in her. Think in terms of what a wonderful thing it will be to share your life with her through all the years to come. You have been looking on the dark side. Look on the bright side. If you will keep sacred the bond of trust between you, you will make it, and you will make it in a wonderful way. You will love it and wonder why you ever doubted."<br><br>I am happy to report that they recently celebrated their fifty-fourth wedding anniversary. They have reared an excellent family. Theirs has been a wonderful marriage. And now in their golden years, they love and cherish one another, even more than when they were young.<br><br>And so, I come to you this morning looking on the bright side. I hope and pray that I may be inspired to say something of interest to you, something that will be helpful.<br><br>I am here representing the First Presidency of the Church and the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees. President Benson serves as chair of this board, and his counselors serve as vice chairs.<br><br>It has been customary for the chair to speak here each October shortly after the opening of the fall semester. President Benson is unable to come because of his advanced age. We all regret that. I do particularly. I think he would love to be here, and I would love to have him here. I bring you his love and his blessing.<br><br>I likewise bring the respect and appreciation of the entire board. I speak to both students and faculty in doing so.<br><br>First, I want to thank you for the strength of your desire to teach and learn with inspiration and knowledge, and for your commitment to live the standards of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for your integrity and your innate goodness. I am confident that never in the history of this institution has there been a faculty better qualified professionally nor one more loyal and dedicated to the standards of its sponsoring institution. Likewise, I am satisfied that there has never been a student body better equipped to learn at the feet of this excellent faculty, nor one more prayerful and decent in attitude and action.<br><br>There may be exceptions. There doubtless are. But they are few in number compared with the larger body.<br><br>I do not want to infer that this is paradise on earth. You may think it just the opposite as you grind away at your studies. But notwithstanding the rigors of that grind, the unrelenting day-after-day pressure you feel, this is a great time to be alive, and this is a wonderful place to be.<br><br>This institution is unique. It is remarkable. It is a continuing experiment on a great premise that a large and complex university can be first class academically while nurturing an environment of faith in God and the practice of Christian principles. You are testing whether academic excellence and belief in the Divine can walk hand in hand. And the wonderful thing is that you are succeeding in showing that this is possible--not only that it is possible, but that it is desirable, and that the products of this effort show in your lives qualities not otherwise attainable.<br><br>As you are aware, we recently announced in conference that another temple will be built in this general area. The reason is that the Provo Temple is the busiest in the Church, operating beyond its designed capacity. The Jordan River Temple is the second busiest in the Church. One factor in all of this is the devotion to temple work of Brigham Young University faculty and students. Many of you, I am told, attend a session in the temple early in the morning before your classes. Many are there in the evening and on Saturday. This all says something of tremendous significance. It speaks of devotion and loyalty, of unselfishness and faith.<br><br>Furthermore, this remarkable faculty carry many responsibilities of great importance in the Church at the general level, at the stake level, and at the ward level. You are men and women of faith as well as of learning. I believe you are the equivalent of your peers anywhere in the world in terms of professional qualifications. Beyond this, you speak with conviction concerning the God of Heaven, the Savior and the Redeemer of the World, and the beauty and power of the restored and eternal gospel. I believe you seek to live these principles. I know of no other university faculty--I think there is none other anywhere on earth--where the members can stand and say with conviction, "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men" (Articles of Faith 1:13).<br><br>I believe that you seek to exemplify that declaration in your lives. I commend you and thank you and extend to you our appreciation and respect.<br><br>I repeat, there may be exceptions. But I think those are few. And if such there be, I am confident that in their hearts they feel ill at ease and uncomfortable, for there can never be peace nor comfort in any element of disloyalty. Wherever there is such an attitude there is a nagging within the heart that says, "I am not being honest in accepting the consecrated tithing funds of the humble and faithful of this Church. I am not being honest with myself or others as a member of this faculty while teaching or engaging in anything that weakens the faith and undermines the integrity of those who come to this institution at great sacrifice and with great expectations."<br><br>I recently read a book that fascinated me. It is a dual biography of the two great generals of the American Civil War--Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant. They were personalities as different as perhaps two men could be. One was the epitome of intellect, rigid self-discipline, culture, and rectitude. The other was somewhat careless in his ways, his career marked with failure, but he possessed a shrewd and calculating mind. Each in his own way was brilliant.<br><br>Moreover, each was driven by a great and serious sense of trust imposed by those to whom he was accountable. One had greater resources and, I believe, perhaps a better cause than the other, and this accounted for his victory. But the other was nonetheless a great and remarkable man. I could spend the hour here talking about each of them. But that is not why I am here. I mention them only because the author of this book, after tremendous research, concluded: "Trust is what makes any army work, and trust comes from the top down" (Gene Smith, author of<i>Lee and Grant: A Dual Biography,</i>quoted in "Hitching a Ride to History," in<i>Reader's Digest Condensed Books,</i>vol. 4 [Pleasantville, New York: Reader's Digest Association, 1984], p. 299).<br><br>I want all of you to know that you have the trust and confidence of the governing board. This is called the board of trustees. It also carries a very heavy and sacred trust. It has the burden of responsibility for setting policies of governance for this great institution and responsibility for the expenditure of the many millions of dollars of sacred funds used to maintain this university.<br><br>We share your exuberant gladness when BYU wins a well-fought game. We share your pride when BYU and members of its faculty or student body are honored by its peer institutions and people. We share your pain and your hurt when the media exploit, as they are wont to do, any untoward, any unseemly, any ugly or misguided statement or act emanating from faculty or students. You are part of this great family we call The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When one member experiences a significant accomplishment, the others rejoice with him. But when a member does something that is a violation of the code of that family, the entire family is injured and feels the pain.<br><br>Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability. That trust involves standards of behavior as well as standards of academic excellence. For each of us it carries with it a larger interest than our own interest. It carries with it the interest of the university, and the interest of the Church, which must be the interest of each and all of us.<br><br>Some few students resent the fact that the board has imposed a code of honor and a code of dress and behavior to which all are expected to subscribe. Bishops, and now stake presidents, are requested to interview each student and certify his or her acceptance of the standards set forth in these codes.<br><br>I think I can hear a student, perhaps a number of them, saying to a bishop, "Why do we have to sign these codes? Don't they trust us?"<br><br>I am reminded of what I heard from a man--a great, strong, and wise man--who served in the presidency of this Church years ago. His daughter was going out on a date, and her father said to her, "Be careful. Be careful of how you act and what you say."<br><br>She replied, "Daddy, don't you trust me?"<br><br>He responded, "I don't entirely trust myself. One never gets too old nor too high in the Church that the adversary gives up on him."<br><br>And so, my friends, we ask you to subscribe to these codes and to have the endorsement of your respective bishops and stake presidents in doing so. It is not that we do not trust you. But we feel that you need reminding of the elements of your contract with those responsible for this institution and that you may be the stronger in observing that trust because of the commitment you have made. With every trust there must be accountability, and this is a reminder of that accountability.<br><br>It is so with the faculty and with all of us. We ask that all members of the faculty, who are members of the Church, be what we speak of as "temple-recommend worthy." This does not evidence any lack of trust. It simply represents a standard, a benchmark of belief and action. The setting of this standard is not new or unusual. It is not new at BYU or in the Church Educational System, though it has been unevenly applied at times. It is a standard applied widely in the Church.<br><br>Our thousands of bishops, who stand as common judges in Israel, annually must renew their own temple recommends, as must stake presidents also. The renewal of that recommend becomes a renewal of commitment. We live in a world and in an environment where we are surrounded by the corrosive and erosive elements of the world. We are all human, even though our callings be high and noble. We all need the constant reminder of commitments we have made and standards to which we have subscribed.<br><br>Surely, our Father in Heaven loves his sons and daughters. He trusts us. That very trust becomes as an iron rod to which we may cling as we walk the path of immortality. Some stumble and err and violate the trust. They are accountable for what they do.<br><br>I am confident the Savior trusts us, and yet he asks that we renew our covenants with him frequently and before one another by partaking of the sacrament, the emblems of his suffering in our behalf.<br><br>We are, of course, properly concerned about you who teach at this great institution. You are the bone and sinew of the university. We are concerned that your academic credentials be the very best and that there be a quality of excellence in all you do. We are also concerned with your faith, your principles. I hope you will not regard us as being unduly cautious or unnecessarily critical. We act in the spirit spoken of by Alma concerning teachers in his day. Said he: "Trust no one to be your teacher ..., except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments" (Mosiah 23:14).<br><br>Yesterday, much of the world celebrated the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' voyage of discovery. Scholars may dispute certain aspects concerning the priority and outcomes of that historic venture, but none can ever sell short the man who kept his trust in God as he sailed the trackless sea and who held himself accountable to the sovereigns of Spain, who were his sponsors.<br><br>As a boy I read Joaquin Miller's poem "Columbus" and was stirred by it. I recall a few of those lines:<br><br><i>Behind him lay the gray Azores,</i><br><i>Behind the Gates of Hercules;</i><br><i>Before him not the ghost of shores;</i><br><i>Before him only shoreless seas.</i><br><br><i>The good mate said: "Now must we pray,</i><br><i>For lo! the very stars are gone,</i><br><i>Brave Adm'r'l speak; what shall I say?"</i><br><i>"Why, say: 'Sail on! sail on! and on!'"</i><br><i>...</i><br><i>Then pale and worn, he paced his deck,</i><br><i>And peered through darkness. Ah, that night</i><br><i>Of all dark nights! And then a speck--</i><br><i>A light! A light! At last a light!</i><br><br><i>It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!</i><br><i>It grew to be Time's burst of dawn.</i><br><i>He gained a world; he gave that world</i><br><i>Its grandest lesson: "On! sail on!"</i><br><br>Columbus kept his trust and discovered a hemisphere.<br><br>I think of Lord Nelson on the morning of the Battle of Trafalgar when he said: "England expects every man will do his duty." After that fierce and bloody contest, as he stood on the deck of his ship to extend humanity to his enemy, a ball was fired within fifteen yards of where he stood.<br><br>He fell to the deck, his spine shattered. He expired three and a quarter hours later, his last articulated words being, "Thank God, I have done my duty" (21 October 1805, from Robert Southey,<i>Life of Nelson</i>[1813], ch. 9).<br><br>A tall shaft and statue stand in his honor in Trafalgar Square in London.<br><br>Wilford Woodruff, in 1835, not long after he had joined the Church, was sent on a mission with a companion who was to accompany him. They traveled through mud and floods, experiencing a great variety of hardships in the pursuit of their duty. He wrote in his journal:<br><br><i>We walked forty miles in a day through mud and water knee-deep.</i><br><br><i>On the 24th of March, after traveling some ten miles through mud, I was taken lame with a sharp pain in my knee. I sat down on a log.</i><br><br><i>My companion, who was anxious to get to his home in Kirtland, left me sitting in an alligator swamp. I did not see him again for two years. I knelt down in the mud and prayed, and the Lord healed me, and I went on my way rejoicing.</i>[<i>Leaves from My Journal</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1881), p. 16]<br><br>Wilford Woodruff kept his trust and lived to become a prophet.<br><br>I repeat the quotation I gave earlier: "Trust is what makes any army work, and trust comes from the top down."<br><br>Trust is what makes a government work, and maybe a lack of trust is one reason for the serious problems we are experiencing. Trust is what makes the wheels of commerce turn. It is what makes possible the strength and growth of the Church. It is what makes Brigham Young University work.<br><br>Trust and accountability are two great words by which we must guide our lives if we are to live beyond ourselves and rise to higher planes of service.<br><br>This is, and must ever be, an institution where the soul is nurtured while the intellect is trained.<br><br>The motto of this university came from the pen of a prophet of God who spoke under the power of revelation: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br>The charter of its conduct was spoken by another prophet to its founding president: "You ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (Brigham Young to Karl G. Maeser, quoted in Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl</i>G.<i>Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1953], p. 26).<br><br>Among the marvelous words of the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants are these:<br><br><i>The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh--</i><br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:19–20]<br><br>We trust you to do so. We love you. We respect you. We pray for you as faculty and students. We place upon you a great and sacred charge to excel in the imparting and learning of secular knowledge and at the same time nurture the spirit within. I challenge you to stand always on a high plane of moral integrity, of spiritual strength, of professional excellence.<br><br>This is a world-class university, a great temple of learning where a highly qualified faculty instruct a large and eager body of students. These teachers impart with skill and dedication the accumulated secular knowledge of the centuries while also building faith in the eternal verities that are the foundation of civilization.<br><br>Such is our unqualified expectation. Such, I sincerely believe, is the desire of all, save perhaps a few. Such, I sincerely hope, will be the resolve of everyone.<br><br>May God bless you, my beloved associates, both young and old, in this great undertaking of teaching and learning, of trust and accountability, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13October 1992.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
This summer I reached one of those time-dictated milestones in my life--the experience of a seventieth birthday. The family thought it was such a special event, they determined to organize a birthday party and invite all of the immediate family to join in. My brother felt it was important enough to drive all the way from Seattle to be with us. Another one drove from Cache Valley. My sisters were already in Salt Lake, and they were the ones, along with my wife, who arranged the celebration.<br><br>There in the presence of those who mean the most to me, my family, I had a very enjoyable evening. We all did. Attending were my wife, my children, and all of my grandchildren save one, who is in the mission field, my two sisters, my two brothers and their wives, and nieces and nephews. The evening was filled with stories and events that brought back a flood of memories.<br><br>It started out with my sister reminding me how old I was by telling this little account. She said, "Remember when you returned home from your mission and you were invited to a post-mission interview with Levi Edgar Young, one of the Presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy?"<br><br>The number of missionaries in those days was so small that those returning were given an interview by a General Authority. As the interview concluded, I was instructed to go home and tell my stake president that I was to be ordained a seventy. Puffed with pride, I returned home and informed my stake president the instruction I had received. The stake president happened to be my father. He never acted on the instruction--I was never ordained a seventy.<br><br>This puzzled me, and I sought out my mother to inquire why my father had never acted on the instruction. My mother gave me some wise counsel. She said, "Don't worry about it. He is your stake president, and he knows what calling is right for you." A short time later I was called into the stake Young Men's presidency, which led to an event where I met a beautiful young lady who soon became my wife. My sister had brought back a very pleasant memory. Then she startled me with this statement, "At last you've made it to the seventies."<br><br>Finally the time arrived for the time-honored tradition of opening birthday gifts. This is always a frustration for my family. What do you give a dad, at my age, when he already has a drawer full of new, unused socks, white shirts still in plastic wrap, and four racks full of ties? My son came forward and said, "At last I've found just the right gift for you," and he handed me a baseball bat with a white stocking over the end. My first reaction was, "A baseball bat at seventy years of age?"<br><br>I pulled off the white stocking, and then I understood why it was a perfect gift. On the end of the bat was imprinted "Adirondack, Willie Mays' Personal Model" with the actual signature of Willie Mays. This bat was a symbol of many great memories. My mind was flooded with memories of a special birthday that had occurred thirty years earlier. We had just moved from California to New York. We had left our favorite baseball team, the San Francisco Giants, and Willie Mays, who was, of course, their star.<br><br>On this special birthday, Willie and the Giants were in New York playing the Mets. My son had saved his money and purchased two tickets as his birthday present to me that year. I came home from work early that day so we'd have time to make the long traffic-filled drive to the Mets' ballpark for the start of the game. We bought hot dogs, 7UP, and popcorn and settled in our seats to watch Willie Mays beat the Mets. The game was tied at 4 to 4 at the end of nine innings. Willie's record was four at-bats and zero hits. I said to my son, "We have a long drive home, and I have to get up early to catch the train in to the city for a meeting." His response was, "Willie won't be up until next inning. Let's watch him bat once more." The same response came after the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, and the fourteenth innings--and on up to the twenty-third inning. Now it was well after midnight, and the drive home was well over an hour. Each time I suggested leaving, his response was, "Let's watch Willie bat one more time."<br><br>Then, in the first of the twenty-third inning, Willie came to bat and drove the ball over the center-field fence. Of course we finished watching the last of the twenty-third inning to be certain the Giants would win 5 to 4. We arrived home at 2:30 a.m. I wasn't at my best in the meetings the following day, but I had a lasting memory to cherish. Now a piece of wood, a baseball bat, stands in the corner of my office to remind me of a special father-son relationship filled with so many great memories.<br><br>I remember taking a little child from his mother's arms and carrying him to the front of a congregation of Saints, there giving him a name and a father's blessing. How grateful I was to be worthy of the priesthood keys that qualified me for such a special privilege. I remember how important it was on his eighth birthday when I could take him into the waters of baptism and then bring him out, again exercising the keys of the priesthood, confirming him a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Four years later came another memory, for then I was serving as a member of a bishopric, and I was empowered with my priesthood keys to place my hands on his head and confer upon him the Aaronic Priesthood and ordain him to the office of a deacon in that priesthood.<br><br>So it went, on through the priesthood offices of teacher and priest. He reached the great age of nineteen, and now I found myself holding the office of a stake president. I was able to assign myself to confer the Melchizedek Priesthood upon my son and ordain him to the office of elder. Then came the thrill of setting him apart as a full-time missionary and sending him off to Japan to serve the Lord.<br><br>Shortly after he returned from a successful mission, I was called to be a General Authority. With that call came the sealing power, which was conferred on me. A few years later my son and a beautiful young lady knelt before me in the holy temple, and I sealed them together as husband and wife for time and for all eternity.<br><br>It doesn't even stop there. The two of them were soon on their way east to New Haven, Connecticut, to attend school. One night I received a telephone call from my son. He said, "Dad, how fast can you make it to New Haven?" I asked what the problem was. He said, "No problem. I'm being called into the bishopric on Sunday, and I want you to ordain me to the office of high priest." So I took off on the next flight to New Haven to make another unique memory.<br><br>Even after that it wasn't over. A few years later I returned from a stake conference assignment and received another telephone call. My son said to me, "Elder Ashton has just called me to be a stake president. He knows our history. He said he would not dare put his hands on my head to set me apart to the new office. Can you drive to Provo and set me apart?" What great memories of a father-son relationship this piece of wood holds for me!<br><br>I learned something else about memories on a recent trip to the Netherlands. The mission president's wife, in one of our gatherings, was telling about her instructions to the missionaries in which she used two statements: "I wish I had" and "I'm glad I did." So this evening I come to you with a question about eternal memories you are building in your lives. Are they followed by the comment "I wish I had ," or can you say, "I'm glad I did"?<br><br>One of the best examples I can think of in the scriptures of one who "wished he had" is Alma. After his conversion he went forth in the work with mighty vigor and vitality, with courage and determination to accomplish that which he had been called to do. The Lord gave him another chance to be able to say, "I'm glad I did."<br><br>Before Alma's miraculous conversion, however, Alma the Elder had deep concerns. He was the spiritual leader of the Nephites, and he was aware that many of the young people did not believe in God. They would not be baptized and would not join the Church. Even worse was the fact that the faithful members of the Church were being mocked and scorned by the unbelievers--these unbelievers being led by his own son, Alma. He was doing all he could to destroy the Church.<br><br>Alma the Younger was one of the most vile of all sinners. He was a wicked and idolatrous man and was a great hinderment to the work of God. When the people listened to his flattering but untrue words, their faith in the Lord faltered and Satan began to have power over them. Slowly they were being led away from the truth. In spite of Alma the Younger's wickedness, his father loved him and never gave up hope that his son would repent and live a better life. He longed to see his son happy and faithful in the Church. Together with many of the other faithful people, he prayed with much faith that somehow his son would be brought to the knowledge of the truth.<br><br>Young Alma had four friends who were the sons of King Mosiah. They, too, were wicked. They joined Alma in traveling throughout the land, seeking to tear down the Church. One day while they were engaged in their evil pursuits, an angel of the Lord appeared unto them. When the angel spoke, his voice sounded like thunder and caused the earth where the young men stood to shake violently. Alma and his friends were so frightened that they fell to the ground. The angel commanded, "Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?" (Mosiah 27:13).<br><br>Obediently Alma stood and listened to the angel. He was told that his father had prayed for him. The angel explained that he had been sent in answer to the faithful prayers of Alma's father. The angel had come to convince young Alma of the power of God, and as he spoke the earth shook. He asked Alma:<br><br><i>And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God.</i><br><br><i>Now I say unto thee: . . . go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</i>[Mosiah 27:15–16]<br><br>With these words the angel departed. Alma and his friends were so astonished that they again fell to the earth. With their own eyes they had seen an angel of the Lord. They had heard his voice and had felt the ground tremble when he spoke. They knew that only the power of God could cause the earth to shake so violently.<br><br>Alma the Younger was so overcome by the things he had seen and heard that he was left powerless for several days. He could not speak or even move his arms or legs. When his friends saw how helpless he was, they carried him home and laid him before his father. Alma the Elder was overjoyed when he heard what had happened to his son. He knew his prayers were being answered and that the Lord was helping his son know the truth. He was so happy he invited a multitude of people to come and see the result of the prayers they had offered.<br><br>Then Alma the Elder asked the members of the priesthood to fast and pray that the Lord would open the mouth of Alma the Younger so that he might speak, and also that his arms and legs would receive their strength. For two days and two nights they fasted and prayed. During this time Alma the Younger lay motionless. He was going through the difficult process of repentance. He was being tormented by his sins, remembering how he had rebelled against God. He realized that he had led many people to do evil. The very thought of his coming into God's presence racked Alma's soul with horror. He thought, "Oh, . . . that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds" (Alma 36:15).<br><br>Admitting all of his sins was an agonizing and painful experience. He was deeply sorrowful and ashamed. In the midst of all this despair, young Alma remembered his father had said that Christ would come to the world and suffer for the sins of all mankind. For the first time in his life, Alma the Younger pleaded for forgiveness, crying, "O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me" (Alma 36:18). At last Alma's suffering was replaced by a feeling of exquisite joy when he realized he had been forgiven. He knew that the Savior loved him, and an overwhelming love for the Lord filled his whole soul. He had been taught a powerful testimony of the truth.<br><br>Young Alma arose from his bed and began to speak to the people. It must have been a special thrill for his father to hear him say, "I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit" (Mosiah 27:24). He bore testimony to the people, saying that although he had once rejected Jesus, he now knew that Jesus was the Son of God and the Redeemer of the World.<br><br>Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah changed their lives. Instead of trying to destroy the Church, they traveled throughout all the land trying to correct the wrongs they had done. Then the scriptures record:<br><br><i>And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</i><br><br><i>But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</i><br><br><i>And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</i><br><br><i>And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</i><br><br><i>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</i><br><br><i>And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</i>[Mosiah 27:32–37]<br><br>From this time forward we find Alma going forth and preaching with much boldness, having the courage to stand up in dangerous situations and declare his belief to those who would listen to him. He suffered much persecution and humiliation because of the service he was rendering to bring souls unto our Lord and Savior.<br><br>As we read on in his missionary experiences, we find him so enthused with the service he is rendering that he almost wishes he did not have the limits of mortality to restrict him in his work. Listen to his words now:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption</i>,<i>that they should repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 29:1–2]<br><br>What an example of the "I'm-glad-I-did" attitude!<br><br>Reaching back into the history of mankind, if we could select just one principle that would especially contribute to the "I'm-glad-I-did" memories, what would it be? I think the choice is obvious. It would be the principle of obedience. When our first earthly parents found themselves cast out of the Garden of Eden into the lone and dreary world, they found a new burdensome requirement thrust upon them: to obtain their bread by the sweat of their brow. Overwhelmed by their new responsibility they turned to the Lord. The scriptures record the results of their petition:<br><br><i>And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.</i><br><br><i>And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i><br><br><i>And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.</i><br><br><i>And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i>[Moses 5:4–11]<br><br>It is interesting to note what a special peace and contentment filled the souls of Adam and Eve once they understood the purpose of their being and the rules by which they would live in order to enjoy the continued blessings of the Lord.<br><br>There is not a more powerful lesson communicated by the Lord through his prophets than this message contained in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>The Old Testament is full of stories that teach the principle of obedience. We find Samuel anointing Saul to be king over Israel. He was then given the charge to go and avenge the wrongs the Amalekites had inflicted upon Israel. He was to utterly destroy them and all they possessed. Saul marched against the Amalekites, proceeding on with his mission of destruction. But when he and the armies found the fine animals they possessed, they could not bring themselves to put the sword to such good stock. So they spared "the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good," and destroyed the rest.<br><br><i>Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,</i><br><br><i>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night. . . .</i><br><br><i>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? . . .</i><br><br><i>And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, . . . and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</i><br><br><i>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.</i><br><br><i>And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</i><br><br><i>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</i><br><br><i>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</i>[1 Samuel 15:9–11, 13–14, 20–24]<br><br>Obedience helps make such good memories. The Book of Mormon is full of accounts of the blessings that come from obedience to the laws of the Lord and the destruction that is associated with disobedience. There is no greater evidence found than following Lehi's family as they journeyed toward the promised land. Obedience brings instruments, tools, direction, food, and peace to his family. Disobedience brings heartache, suffering, and turmoil.<br><br>The test of obedience comes almost immediately to the family as the father directs his sons to return to Jerusalem to obtain the brass plates that contain the scriptures and the family genealogy. Nephi responded to his father's request by saying:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>After two failed attempts, they determined to go by faith, trusting in the Lord to accomplish their task. The third attempt brought success. Then Nephi learned a valuable lesson.<br><br><i>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</i><br><br><i>And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</i><br><br><i>And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</i>[1 Nephi 4:13–16]<br><br>Can you imagine the feeling of joy that filled the soul of Nephi as he delivered the record to his father, and also as they examined it and found it to contain the five books of Moses plus the genealogy of Lehi? Here was proof that he was a descendant of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. Again we read the reaction of Lehi as he studied the brass plates that his son had delivered to him:<br><br><i>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed--</i><br><br><i>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</i><br><br><i>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</i>[1 Nephi 5:17–21]<br><br>The<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism</i>states:<br><br><i>Obedience in the context of the gospel of Jesus Christ means to comply with God's will, to live in accordance with his teachings and the promptings of his spirit, and to keep his commandments. Disobedience means to do anything less, whether it be to follow Satan and his will, to live in accordance with one's own selfish wants and desires, or to be a "slothful" person who must be "compelled in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 58:26).</i><br><br><i>Part of God's purpose in designing mortal life for his children was to "prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abr. 3:25; cf. D&amp;amp;C 98:14). Passing such a test is necessary for one to progress to become like God because he, himself, lives in accordance with law and principles of justice (Alma 42:22–26; see Godhood). Thus, obedience to divine law is essential to eternal progression, and those who live obediently in this life will "have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abr. 3:26).</i>[<i>Encyclopedia of Mormonism,</i>vol. 3 (New York: Macmillan Co., 1992), pp. 1020–21]<br><br>We all make daily entries in our book of life. Occasionally we take it from the shelf and examine the entries we are making. What kind of memories will flood your mind as you examine the pages of your personal entries? How many pages will contain "I-wish-I-had" entries? Will there be entries of procrastination and failure to take advantage of special opportunities? Will you find there entries of thoughtlessness in treatment of family, friends, or even strangers? Will there be those of remorse resulting from acts of unrighteousness and disobedience? Will there be acts of dishonesty and lack of trust? Will there be entries showing a lack of faith and a turning to the destructive powers of worldliness?<br><br>Fortunately, each day brings a clean, white page on which to change entries from "I wish I had" to "I'm glad I did" through the process of recognition, remorse, repentance, and restitution. The harder we try to make many "I'm-glad-I-did" entries each hour of each day, the more "I-wish-I-had" marks will find their way into the corners of our minds. Feelings of depression for past acts or missed opportunities will be outshone by memory banks filled with exhilaration and enthusiasm and with the joy of living.<br><br>As you examine the memorabilia you have put into your book of life, will you find the ones prescribed by the Lord in being obedient to his laws? Will there be baptismal certificates, priesthood ordinations for both the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods for the men and Pursuit of Excellence awards for the women, and, of course, a letter of honorable release from a full-time mission? Will there be current temple recommends, a marriage license for a marriage performed in the holy temple, tithing receipts, and acceptance to priesthood and auxiliary calls? Some of these mentioned may still be blank spaces as part of your future plans.<br><br>My counsel to you tonight is to fill up your memory bank and your book of life with as many "I'm-glad-I-did" activities as you can possibly crowd into one lifetime. King Benjamin in his great address counseled us on obedience by saying:<br><br><i>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>It is our hope and prayer that each of us will find the commitment and discipline in our lives to seek after those positive experiences that will lead to liberty and eternal life. It is my witness to you that God lives. It is by conforming our lives to his law that we will find true happiness here and eternal opportunities in the life to come. I say this in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1> &quot;Know He Is There&quot; - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have always been impressed with an experience President Hugh B. Brown, former member of the First Presidency, shared with me when I was serving a mission under his direction in the British Isles. He told about his mother's encouraging words as he left on his mission when he was about twenty years of age. This, essentially, was her message, as I recall.<br><br><i>Hugh, you remember when you were a little boy and you would have a bad dream or wake up in the night frightened, you would call from your room: "Mother, are you there?" and I would answer and try to comfort you and remove your fears. Now as you go on a mission and out into the world there will be times when you will be frightened, when you feel weak, inadequate, alone, and have problems. I want you to know that you can call to your Heavenly Father as you used to call to me and say: "Father, are you there? I need your help." Do this with the knowledge that he is there and that he will be ready to help you if you will do your part and live worthy of your blessings and needs. I want to reassure you that he is there and will answer your prayers and needs for your best good.</i><br><br>What a blessing it is and can be in the future--when we have special challenges, heartbreaks, unusual experiences, or disappointments--to know that he is there and we can cry unto him in faith and complete trust.<br><br>Very often over the years I have had peace and patience knowing that he was there and would not forsake me even though some prayers were going unanswered. What a joy and strength it would be in all of our lives to have the childlike faith and complete trust to know that he is there and that we can cry out unto him under all circumstances. Thank God for a wise mission president who taught me to know he was there, even though immediate replies and responses were not always positive.<br><br>Perhaps it would be good for our souls to build the relationship and understanding that he is there, even our loving and eternal Father, and that ofttimes delays to our urgent pleas can be best for us. Who is to say it isn't more important to know that he is there than to receive immediate answers? Oftentimes I think of the conditions under which Joseph Smith pled within the confines of horrible prison conditions. It appeared that his needs and pleas were justified as he was confined from his family, his Church, and his friends. He undoubtedly suffered intense mental as well as physical anguish. Answers appeared not to be the Lord's way at that time. Nevertheless, Joseph seemed to be sustained by the overruling knowledge that God was there, knew him, and loved him. While answers to his pleadings and prayers were delayed, God was building a stronger prophet.<br><br>Recall with me his words:<br><br><em>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</em><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be moved with compassion toward them?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>Relief and release were not imminent, but an eternal principle was being stressed.<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>God was there, and he heard. But his purposes and timetables were and are eternal. Often we mortals misunderstand, and instead of answers there are sometimes delays, tests, and trying by fire.<br><br>What a great strength it would be to all of us in times of desperation and wonderment to humbly approach his throne with "Please hear my prayers. Answer them in thy great wisdom for my best good. But please give me the constant reassurance that thou art there and that peace, contentment, and the courage to continue are mine because I have faith and can come to thee who has promised not to forsake us."<br><br>Incidentally, one of my favorite "cry-out-during-the-night" children's stories is that of a four-year-old boy who came during the middle of the night to his father and mother's bedroom, sobbing and crying with great enthusiasm. When his mother drew him near and put her arms around him to give comfort, saying, "What happened?" he said, "I fell out of bed." She asked, "How did you fall out of bed?" And he cried, "Because I wasn't in far enough." This could be used to put over an extensive message as shared by a child, but let me just say in passing it has been my experience that most people who fall out of the Church do so because they were not in far enough.<br><br>What a wonderful situation it would be if we could with feeling and understanding know that God is there, the Church is there, friends are there, leaders and families are there to give us comfort, direction, and reassurance. Oh, that there were more people inclined when special situations arose to say to a classmate or an associate, "I need to be sure that you are there while I am going through this present trying situation."<br><br>Recently, an inactive member of the Church, and a constant critic of what we do and don't do, talked to me for a few minutes. He seems to delight in nipping at my heels and at the Church whenever we get together. Despite his "having-all-of-the-answers" attitude, our relationship is good. He said, "The Church and BYU's policy is now easy to read. With enrollment ceilings and Church schools being restricted by quotas and membership guidelines, students, administrators, or faculty can comply with set standards and policies or get out. They will be either in or out promptly."<br><br>When I hear this kind of banter and bashing comments, I sometimes am annoyed, and other times I'm amused. For the fun of it, after he made this remark, I said, "Did you reach that conclusion on your own, or did it come through prayer?"<br><br>His response: "I don't have to pray any more."<br><br>I reminded him our policy and guidelines over the years have always been that we want students<i>in</i>and not<i>out.</i>Every standard and every procedure is wrapped around the truth that we are all God's children and looking out for each other's best interests.<br><br>It seems to me that when it has been necessary over the years to let someone out for misconduct or failure to comply, it is to have them<i>out</i>so that they can get back<i>in.</i><br><br>At one time I was visiting with an excommunicated member of the Church and used this approach to tell him he had been disciplined and was out of the Church so it would now be possible for him to come back in, with a greater strength and appreciation for the gospel.<br><br>Thank God the great majority realize that every policy and standard recommended is to keep them in comfortably and securely and not to drive them out. I have always thought the Savior, Jesus the Christ, drove the money changers out of the temple so they could come back in with righteous desires and new commitments.<br><br>What a strength it should be to all of us to read and reread and hear and rehear these choice words:<br><br><i>Lord, accept our true devotion.</i><br><i>Let thy Spirit whisper peace.</i><br><i>Swell our hearts with fond emotion,</i><br><i>And our joy in thee increase.</i><br><br><i>Never leave us, never leave us.</i><br><i>Help us, Lord, to win the race.</i><br><i>Never leave us, never leave us.</i><br><i>Help us, Lord, to win the race.</i><br>["Lord, Accept Our True Devotion,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 107]<br><br>I bear witness that God will never leave us. He does not want us out. He wants to help us be our best. He is there, loves us, is our advocate, and will touch our souls in a very special way if we just realize he is always there for us.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father loves each of us. We are his children. He wants us to return to him. It is the adversary's purpose to deter us from a course that leads to happiness and eternal life. Knowing that, our Heavenly Father ordained prayer as a means by which we could always keep in contact with him and not become a stranger to him. We will know with total assurance that he is there and that misuse of free agency on our part is not a prayer-motivated conduct pattern.<br><br><i>If we know he is there, that he loves us, and is our advocate, why do we pray?</i>Individuals pray for different reasons, but the primary purpose of our prayers is to attune ourselves to our Heavenly Father so that we can receive light and truth. It is light and truth that enables us to forsake the evil one.<br><br>From the very beginning the Lord commanded our first parents, Adam and Eve, "Thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son<i>forevermore"</i>(Moses 5:8; emphasis added).<br><br>When we have periods of darkness, misunderstanding, or lack of proper vision, we should pray always. In our dispensation the Lord has said in many revelations, "Pray always." He said that to Joseph Smith, to Martin Harris, to Thomas B. Marsh, to the Church, and to others. Now listen carefully to the Lord's words that apply to each of us: "What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:49). Regrettably, some of those counseled in this revelation did not heed the counsel and were removed out of their place.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant once said:<br><br><i>The minute a man stops supplicating God for his spirit and direction, just so soon he starts out to become a stranger to him and his works. When men stop praying for God's spirit, they place confidence in their own unaided reason, and they gradually lose the spirit of God.</i>["Some Sentence Sermons,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>August 1944, p. 481]<br><br>I ask you, does this declaration adequately describe my critical friend who no longer prays?<br><br><i>For what do we pray?</i>As near as I can tell, the Lord has not placed any limitations on where we pray or what we should pray for. There is only this caution: We are not to pray just to gratify our selfish desires. He said: "Do not ask for that which you ought not" (D&amp;amp;C 8:10).<br><br>Here are some of the Lord's admonitions on where to pray, how often, and for what we should pray.<br><br><i>And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:28]<br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.</i><br><br><i>Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.</i><br><br><i>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</i>[Alma 34:18–27]<br><br><i>What if we don't feel like praying?</i>We may all benefit from this admonition from Nephi: "If ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray" (2 Nephi 32:8).<br><br>Perhaps we could do well to involve ourselves in more and more quiet saying of prayers. There are strength and power and discipline rewards in communicating with God on a continuing personal and private basis. Quietly we can pray for the patience to have our secret prayers answered. Sometimes we fail to recognize answered prayers because we are deaf to his quiet promptings.<br><br>Listen to President Brigham Young's counsel on the matter of praying even when we don't feel like it or when earthly requests have not been satisfied.<br><br><i>It matters not whether you or I feel like praying, when the time comes to pray, pray. If we do not feel like it, we should pray till we do. . . . You will find that those who wait till the Spirit bids them pray, will never pray much on this earth</i>. [<i>DBY,</i>p. 44]<br><br>And he continues:<br><br><i>If I did not feel like praying, . . . I should say, "Brigham, get down here on your knees, bow your body down before the throne of him who rules in the heavens, and stay there until you can feel to supplicate at that throne of grace erected for sinners."</i>[<i>DBY,</i>p. 46]<br><br>And here is an invitation to pray when you don't feel like it.<br><br><i>More things are wrought by prayer</i><br><i>Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice</i><br><i>Rise like a fountain for me night and day.</i><br><i>For what are men better than sheep or goats</i><br><i>That nourish a blind life within the brain,</i><br><i>If knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer</i><br><i>Both for themselves and those who call them</i><br><i>friend?</i><br>[Alfred, Lord Tennyson,<i>Idylls of the King, The Passing of Arthur,</i>lines 413–21]<br><br><i>Now an additional thought or two about unanswered prayers. Why doesn't God answer my prayers?</i>Over the years I have listened to or observed from troubled lives of individuals various reactions to prayer. Here are just a couple of examples:<br><br>A brokenhearted mother who has prayed and mourned over a wayward son. In spite of her fasting and prayers, the young man continues on his wayward course. At present I am sorry to report I am concerned about both the son and the mother because they tell me they are sour on prayer.<br><br>A brother who is faithful in the Church--paying his tithing, serving in the Church, and attending the temple--but who experienced failure in his marriage. He can't understand why the Lord doesn't get his wife to change. He tells me he prays for her to change every day.<br><br>These are just a few examples of individuals who felt their prayers were not answered, promptly or properly.<br><br><i>Dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i>[Ether 12:6]<br><br><i>We are looked upon by God as though we were in eternity. God dwells in eternity, and</i>does not view things as we do. [<i>Teachings,</i>p. 356; emphasis added]<br><br>That is a statement from the Prophet Joseph Smith. God sees things from an eternal perspective--not viewing things as we do.<br><br>Generally our Heavenly Father will not interfere with the agency of another person unless he has a greater purpose for that individual. Two examples come to mind: Saul, who became the Apostle Paul, and Alma the Younger. Both these men were deterred from their unrighteous objective of persecuting and trying to destroy the Church of God. Both became great missionaries for the Church. But even as the Lord intervened, they were given choices. Alma, for example, was told: "If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God" (Alma 36:11).<br><br>We are to exercise faith. We are placed on earth as a probation. It is not now, nor was it ever, the intention of a wise, omniscient Heavenly Father to solve all our problems. Life is not--and never will be--an "uninterrupted holiday." God expects us to struggle--so we may become godlike. The edict from Eden was that man should eat bread by the sweat of his brow!<br><br>Like a wise parent, our Heavenly Father sometimes says "no" to our pleas. It is therefore essential that we cultivate a feeling for spiritual things that will enable us to "feel" or recognize occasions when our Heavenly Father is telling us "no." Even when his Beloved Son requested that the bitter cup of pain and sorrow be lifted in Gethsemane, our Heavenly Father had other plans. How eternally blessed we are because God permitted his Son to complete that suffering so we will not have to suffer if we repent.<br><br>"Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you,<i>that is expedient for you"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 88:64; emphasis added). And again, "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name,<i>which is right,</i>believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you" (3 Nephi 18:20; emphasis added).<br><br>How do we know when something is expedient (appropriate, good, or fitting) for us? Again we are counseled: "Ask the Father in my name, in faith believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost, which manifesteth<i>all things which are expedient</i>unto the children of men" (D&amp;amp;C 18:18; emphasis added).<br><br>I want you students to especially know today that I know that God hears and answers prayers. He has answered many of mine. I have lived sufficiently long on this earth to see that some of the prayers, which I concluded were not answered, were answered for my best good. I am still trying to recognize a "no" answer. I am still trying to recognize and accept silent answers.<br><br>I have total confidence and faith in the wisdom and omniscience of a loving, merciful Heavenly Father--to be dependent upon him and yet to communicate with him, I must make faithful personal effort on a never-ending basis.<br><br>I testify to you that he is a living, loving Father. He is approachable and, as the Prophet Joseph discovered, we can talk to him of our innermost desires and he will not upbraid!<br><br>Remember while in the depths of personal anguish in Liberty Jail the Prophet Joseph Smith cried to the Lord, "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1).<br><br>God bless each of you to be patient, prayerful, and submissive to the Spirit as you attend this great university.<br><br>Let me conclude with an intimate "Are-you-there?" experience. Sister Ashton and I live in a condo apartment on State Street in downtown Salt Lake. From our sixth-level unit in the living room we have a direct full view of the Salt Lake Temple. The temple is framed beautifully in that setting, and we enjoy frequent views of the majestic structure, particularly at night when the lights are on or when the sun is setting.<br><br>A few years ago Sister Ashton suddenly needed immediate hospitalization. After taking her to the hospital, we prayed together, and then I went home and prayed privately. Because of the suddenness of the development and the deep affection I have for her, I was not able to sleep.<br><br>After a restless hour or so I got up out of bed, walked into the living room, and looked at the temple. Yes, the lights on the Salt Lake Temple are on all night. I remember well walking around the living room countless times looking at the temple and saying to myself with a bowed head with an unwavering faith, "I know he is there." It was kind of a silent cry for that reassurance and strength we have been talking about today.<br><br>Pray constantly for help, endurance, and understanding. God does answer our prayers. Please know he is there. I testify he is, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.
