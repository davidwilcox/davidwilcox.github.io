<h1>ected Path - Peggy Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During the last few months I have been able to meet some of you, and I have also been able to learn some things about you. Let me tell you some of the things that I have learned.<br><br>You are hard workers. Besides attending classes in order to obtain a degree of your choice, many of you have jobs. Some of you are in the performing arts and do amazing things. Some of you are student athletes who succeed at the highest levels. Here I take special note of the women's volleyball team, which for the first time in school history went to the Final Four and played for the national championship. Congratulations to you.<br><br>Most of you have Church callings. Your schedules are full. Hopefully you are able to fit some sleep into your busy schedule. You are indeed a very impressive group. You are what I would call "high achievers," and I imagine that--in order to have achieved all that you have so far--it has been necessary for you to set goals. It is that subject I want to address today.<br><br>Goals are a very significant part of our lives. Goals help us to keep focused. Goals help us plan for and attain the things that are important to us.<br><br>I have found that there are at least three things we should consider when we set our goals. First, we should ask ourselves, "Will this goal help us achieve our own full divine potential?" In other words, are our goals in harmony with Heavenly Father's plan for us, which is to gain "eternal life, . . . the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7)?<br><br>One way we can determine whether our goals are in line with those of Heavenly Father's plan for us is to study our patriarchal blessings. This is the second thing we should consider when we set our goals. Patriarchal blessings are our own personal "road maps" and help us to know what Heavenly Father has planned for us. We need to study them, especially when we set goals. What does your patriarchal blessing tell you? What does Heavenly Father want you to do?<br><br>In my patriarchal blessing I am admonished not to shy away from opportunities to share the gospel. When I first read this many years ago, I realized I needed to make a change in my life. At that time one of the things that I feared most was having to stand up in front of a group of people to teach a lesson or to give a talk. I know that this is not an uncommon fear, but I realized that somehow I had to overcome it because it was something that Heavenly Father wanted me to do--it was a commandment specifically for me, given in my patriarchal blessing.<br><br>I then made it my goal that whenever I was asked to teach a lesson or give a talk I would not "shy away" from it but would willingly accept the invitation. I am still apprehensive about teaching a lesson or giving a talk, especially in a place as big as the Marriott Center, but I know that it is something Heavenly Father wants me to do, so I have faith that, if I try, He will help me.<br><br>In the last general conference, Elder Carlos A. Godoy told of his personal experience in using his patriarchal blessing to evaluate his goals:<br><br><i>At the end of the 1980s, our young family was made up of my wife, Mônica, two of our four children, and me. We lived in São Paulo, Brazil, I worked for a good company, I had finished my university studies, and I had recently been released as bishop of the ward where we had lived. Life was good, and everything seemed to be as it should be--until one day an old friend came to visit us.</i><br><br><i>At the conclusion of his visit, he made a comment and asked a question that unsettled my convictions. He said, "Carlos, everything seems to be going well for you, your family, your career, and your service in the Church, but--" and then came the question, "if you continue to live as you are living, will the blessings promised in your patriarchal blessing be fulfilled?"</i> [Godoy, "The Lord Has a Plan for Us!" <i>Ensign,</i> November 2014]<br><br>As a result of this question from his friend, Elder Godoy paid attention to his patriarchal blessing and made some necessary changes in his life that would help him realize Heavenly Father's promised blessings for him. We can similarly benefit from regularly reading our patriarchal blessings. This practice will help keep our goals and our lives in line with Heavenly Father's plan for us.<br><br>The third consideration that is significant in setting goals is to allow for flexibility. It is important that we learn to adjust to change. We need to learn not to panic when things don't go exactly as we have planned. One thing I have learned is that there is no such thing as an uninterrupted pathway to the goals we make. As someone once observed, there is no freeway to perfection. We usually face detours or unexpected events that occur while trying to achieve our goals.<br><br>When I think of detours and unexpected events, I am reminded of Highway 6 in Utah, a road with which I am very familiar. This stretch of highway is between the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon and my hometown, Price, Utah. If you have ever traveled from Provo to Moab to visit Arches National Park or farther south to Lake Powell, you have driven on this stretch of highway. It is a very beautiful, scenic canyon and one of my favorite drives. Occasionally rockslides can block lanes of traffic, and drivers have to adjust their travel in minor ways to accommodate this. Sometimes, however, there are even greater unplanned changes in the route.<br><br>In April 1983 a massive mountain slide completely covered the highway as well as the main line of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. The slide blocked the flow of the Spanish Fork River, creating a natural dam and flooding the entire area. Because of this mountain slide, traffic had to be diverted for many months as a new section of highway was being built. Anyone who wanted to travel in that direction had to take a route that was twice as long. It was, indeed, very inconvenient. However, what resulted from this mountain slide was a four-lane highway that was much safer than the narrow two-lane highway that had existed before the mountain slide.<br><br>I have learned that life is somewhat like Highway 6. Even though life in general is beautiful and scenic, the road we travel will not always be an uneventful, direct course, even when we know where we are going. We have to learn to be flexible and to deal with the unexpected. Happily, I have also learned that if we pay attention, prepare for the unexpected, and learn not to panic when we are forced to take a longer detour or a different route, things will often work out better than we could have planned on our own.<br><br>Learning to be flexible and adjusting to change can often be very difficult. However, if we are striving to reach our full potential and are setting goals that are in line with Heavenly Father's plan for us, He will help and guide us. We need to remember the Lord's words in Isaiah 55:8–9:<br><br><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways. . . .</i><br><br><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i><br><br>These words can bring us great comfort when the unexpected happens. Simply knowing that Heavenly Father's plan is the best one for us can take the fear out of the unexpected. Let me illustrate with an example.<br><br>My friend Lauri's desire was to gain an education from BYU. Her goal was to obtain her degree in design (a program that no longer exists) and then find employment in that field. While she was attending BYU and pursuing this goal, she was employed part-time at the Registration Office, where she developed organizational and management skills. When she graduated with her degree in design, she was offered a full-time position as an assistant manager in the Registration Office--something that was definitely not in the design field. However, she was newly married and she needed the job in the Registration Office so that she could help support her husband, who was getting his education at BYU. She therefore accepted the offer and put on hold her desire to use her new skills in design. She had to take an unplanned detour. But rather than panic or give up her goal, Lauri adjusted her plans, and a new, improved route appeared.<br><br>Because of her job in the Registration Office, Lauri was given the opportunity to attend a variety of organizational and management skills conferences and presentations, subsequently learning things she had not learned in her major design classes. Before she knew it, Lauri had become the manager of the Registration Office, where she developed those skills even more. In the meantime, Lauri and her husband began to have a family. Her husband continued his schooling, and Lauri continued to work.<br><br>When their first child was born, they had to place the baby in a childcare facility during the hours that Lauri worked. She soon learned that the childcare facility was struggling financially--in fact, it was on the brink of failure. Relying on the skills she had obtained in her unplanned employment, Lauri suggested some things to the owner of the childcare facility that she believed would help the facility improve financially.<br><br>What happened next was totally unexpected. The owner of the childcare facility asked Lauri to take over as owner. The change was made, and Laurie became the new owner of the facility. Because of the skills she had learned in the Registration Office at BYU, she was able to turn the facility into a very profitable organization. And what about her degree in design? She was able to use that as well, as she decorated her new business using the skills she had learned in her design classes.<br><br>The most important thing that happened in Lauri's unexpected detour is that while her husband continued his education and their family grew, her children were able to be with her at the childcare center. She set her goals, and through faith, hard work, responsibility, and the willingness to learn and be flexible, she was, in her own words, "set up for years." Her course was not a direct course and the end results were not what she had originally planned, but they were far better than she could have ever expected.<br><br>The prophet Nephi in the Book of Mormon also had a life of unexpected events. I imagine that Nephi, like most of you, probably had plans and wanted to achieve certain goals. I like to think that if Nephi had lived at this time he would have done things similar to those things you are doing. One of his goals would have been to serve a mission. And following his mission he would have had a goal to attend a university--undoubtedly BYU. We know that he was a good student because he had learned much and "had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God" (1 Nephi 1:1). One of his goals might have been to participate as a student athlete, because we know that he was "large in stature, and [had] much strength" (1 Nephi 4:31; see also 1 Nephi 2:16). He would have done all he could to obtain his goals.<br><br>However, Heavenly Father had different plans for Nephi. His route was not going to be a straight course. Nephi definitely had unexpected detours. But because of his obedience and great faith, he did not panic or fear the detours. He was able to be flexible and adjust to the changes that occurred. He was also very willing to learn new things along the way--even things that may have seemed impossible, such as building an "exceedingly fine" ship (1 Nephi 18:4) that would carry his family to the land of promise.<br><br>Nephi had many wonderful qualities. He accomplished much during his life. The one quality that I admire most was his ability to stay true even when detours were placed in his path. He not only made the necessary adjustments to his plans but did so with a positive attitude. He was always grateful and quick to recognize and acknowledge the tender mercies of the Lord in his life--even during the unexpected and difficult times. If we can be flexible with similar grace, we will be blessed, as was Nephi.<br><br>I have found that life is full of unexpected detours. I know that very well from recent events in my life. I hope that with the beginning of this new year we will take time to set goals, evaluate whether they are consistent with God's plan for us, and read and reread our patriarchal blessings. May we, like Nephi and my friend Lauri, not only be flexible as we encounter detours but also be grateful for the unplanned opportunities Heavenly Father gives us. As we do so, we will develop our full potential as sons and daughters of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy S.

<h1>ully Failing: Pursuing Our Quest for Perfection - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is my first opportunity to address you in a devotional as president of the university. Let me begin by telling you, "You look really good." That is different from being good-looking, though you are that as well. I hope that each of you has some inkling of the spirit you carry with you and the light that radiates from you. It is evident to visitors to the campus--who sometimes struggle to come up with words to describe what they see and feel in your presence. I thank each of you for your individual contribution to what is the real Spirit of the Y that those who come on campus experience so profoundly. It truly is an honor to be your president.<br><br>Those who have heard me speak these past few months will not be surprised that I begin by quoting a portion of the BYU mission statement, which was approved and adopted by the board of trustees more than thirty years ago. That mission statement describes well both the process and the anticipated results of a BYU education. I urge each of you to read and ponder it, as well as the BYU Aims, as this new year begins.<br><br>The most familiar line of that mission statement summarizes, in general terms, the details that follow. "The mission of Brigham Young University," it states, "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>1</sup><br><br>My remarks today focus on one reality about that quest for perfection. It is a truth that is hard to deny, yet difficult to accept. It is this: We will all fail. More than once. Every day.<br><br>I know that may sound startling and not the most optimistic of messages, so let me be quick to add that this does not mean that you or I are failures or that the quest for perfection is futile. There is a difference between failing, even repeatedly, and being a failure, as I hope to explain.<br><br>Failing is an essential part of the mortal phase of our quest for perfection. We don't often think of it that way, but that is only because we tend to focus too much on the word <i>perfection</i> and not enough on the word <i>quest</i> when we read the mission statement. Failure is an inevitable part of the quest. In our quest for perfection, how we respond when we fail will ultimately determine how well we will succeed.<br><br>My plea for you today is to learn how to fail successfully. To help you in that regard, let me provide a little broader context for the quest for perfection and the role that failure plays in that process.<br><br>The primary purpose of our mortal existence is to help us become like our heavenly parents. One of the things we need to do in order to accomplish that purpose is to learn and apply truth in our lives. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance"<sup>2</sup> and that "a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge."<sup>3</sup> Thus learning is an essential part of not only our BYU experience but also this mortal phase of our quest for perfection.<br><br>The scriptures teach that there are three main ways we can learn: one, by study;<sup>4</sup> two, by faith;<sup>5</sup> and, three, by experience.<sup>6</sup> A lot has been written and spoken at BYU about how we learn by study and by faith,<sup>7</sup> but we talk much less about how we learn from experience. Yet learning from experience is one of the essential purposes of our mortal existence.<br><br>In the book of Abraham the plan we all accepted in the grand premortal council is described as follows:<br><br><i>We will go down . . . , and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>This earth, the setting for our mortal existence, was created so that we could "prove" ourselves. But I believe we may not appreciate the full meaning of the word <i>prove</i> in that scripture. In everyday usage the word <i>prove</i> means to demonstrate something that <i>already</i> exists.<sup>9</sup> Thus we take final exams to prove what we already know about the material we have been studying that semester. But the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> provides an additional meaning for the word <i>prove.</i> It indicates that prove also means "to find out, learn, or know by experience."<sup>10</sup><br><br>I believe the opportunity we have to <i>prove</i> ourselves in this life was not designed to allow us to demonstrate to God how obedient we already were before we came to earth. He, and we, already knew that. God formed this earth and gave us this mortal existence so that we could "prove" ourselves in the other sense of that word--so that we could "find out, learn, or know by experience" truths that we did not already know and that we could not learn in any other way.<br><br>I believe there are certain things, some of them essential to our exaltation, that we can learn only through experience. We could not have remained in our premortal condition, memorized all the attributes of godhood, and then, after passing a written exam, become like our heavenly parents. We came to earth to "prove" ourselves, to learn from our own experiences how to know good from evil and other important lessons we could learn only by our own experience. And one of the best ways we can fully learn those essential lessons is by failing in our efforts.<br><br>Let me illustrate with a simple experience from my own professional life. Two years after I graduated from law school I found myself working on a tax law project for a partner in a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. By that time I had not only finished law school but had completed judicial clerkships for two very good judges at two of the best courts in the country and had passed the bar exam. In my mind I knew how to be a lawyer. Even though I had not had any tax law experience before I received the assignment, I knew quite well where to begin looking for the answer to the question posed to me by the partner. After extensive research of the applicable statutes, regulations, and cases--and after revising several drafts--I confidently presented to the partner a memo that I felt answered his question.<br><br>The partner quickly skimmed the memo, read the conclusion, and then confidently opined, "This can't be the law."<br><br>I was quite taken aback and a little offended. "I've read the statutes, the regulations, and the cases," I responded. "That's what they say."<br><br>"I don't care," he retorted. "Tax law in this area can't work the way you've described it. Go try again."<br><br>It was, to use the term my children often use to describe my less glorious moments, an "epic failure."<br><br>After further discussing the issue with the partner, I examined the problem from several angles that started at different points from the one at which I had first begun. Over time a different analysis appeared--one that changed the answer to the question in a subtle but important way. When I presented a revised memo to the partner with a more in-depth analysis and a different answer, he was satisfied. I asked him at that point whether he had known the answer to the question all along and was just trying to make work for me.<br><br>"No," he replied, "I really didn't. I just know how these kinds of businesses work, and I have a pretty good feel for tax law. Your earlier approach just didn't seem right."<br><br>I knew how to acquire abstract legal information; I even knew how to analyze that information in theoretical terms. The partner, however, knew how to be a lawyer--and there is a difference between those two things, just as there is a difference between knowing the attributes of God in an abstract sense and making those attributes a part of our character, which is what our quest for perfection requires.<br><br>How do we learn that latter important skill? The partner helped me understand that as well.<br><br>When I asked him what it was that allowed him to almost intuit the right answer to the problem, he replied, "It takes good judgment."<br><br>"And how do you acquire good judgment?" I asked.<br><br>"Good judgment," he said, "comes from experience."<br><br>Then, after pausing for just a few seconds and with only a hint of a smile, he added, "And experience comes from bad judgment." In other words, from failing.<br><br>As one motivational speaker observed:<br><br><i>We always think of failure as the antithesis of success, but it isn't. Success often lies just the other side of failure.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>The lesson is so prevalent in life that three years ago the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> devoted an entire issue of that publication to the topic of how to learn from failures. <sup>12</sup><br><br>We can see the same lesson in the familiar experience of Nephi when he was given the assignment to obtain the brass plates from Laban. As we know, his first two efforts failed, but he persisted and ultimately succeeded. In the process he discovered the power of being "led by the Spirit," <sup>13</sup> a critical lesson that he may not have learned if the first effort to persuade Laban to release the plates had been successful. Nephi's life was forever changed in a positive way because he failed twice--and, more important, because of the way he responded to those failures.<br><br>Thus failing is a critical component of our eternal progress--our quest for perfection. And because of the Atonement we can--if we respond to failures in the right way--be blessed with a new kind of learning that allows our failures to become part of the perfecting process. As Elder Bruce C. Hafen has explained, the beauty of the gospel is that "because of the Atonement, we can learn from our mistakes without being condemned by them."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-c-hafen_disciples-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>14</sup></a> What a wonderful blessing that absolutely marvelous and indispensable portion of the plan of salvation provides to each of us, if we will but take advantage of it.<br><br>This does not mean that we should try to fail as often as we can. "Not all failures are created equal."<sup>15</sup> In one of the articles in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> Failure Issue, Professor Amy C. Edmondson noted that in business there are three main kinds of failures, some of which are better than others.<br><br>First, there are failures that result from the lack of precision in routine but important matters--for example, a failure to follow design specifications in the manufacturing process. According to Professor Edmondson, these are "bad" failures that are preventable and should be eliminated as quickly as possible.<br><br>Second, there are failures that are the inevitable results of complexity in processes--mistakes made in uncontrollable situations, such as in triage in a hospital emergency room. These failures are unavoidable and cannot be controlled, but they can be managed.<br><br>Finally, there are failures that occur when researchers try to push the frontiers of knowledge with regard to a product or service--failures made by a research lab in developing a new product, for example. These failures can be "good" failures if structured in the right way because they can accelerate the learning process.<sup>16</sup><br><br>If we are to fail successfully--if failure is to move us along in our quest for perfection--we need to make similar distinctions in our daily efforts and daily failures.<br><br>In our own personal lives, willful failure in important, routine things we can control constitutes sin, which we should avoid as much as possible. In things that are routine but essential to our eternal progress--things like daily prayer, daily scripture study, and regular church attendance--we should strive to eliminate all failings. In these matters we can come very close to perfection very quickly, and it is important that we do so, because success in these endeavors provides the secure foundation that allows us to deal effectively with the other two kinds of failure.<br><br>When determining what things fall into this first category of failure, we might profitably ask ourselves two questions: One, are these things entirely within our control? And, two, are they things that in the long run really matter? There is a correlation between affirmative answers to those two questions. As Elder Hafen once observed:<br><br><i>One way to distinguish what matters a great deal from what does not matter so much is to ask whether the subject is within our control. If it is, then it probably matters enough to merit our attention. But if the subject of our fretting is inherently beyond our control, it is not likely that God will hold us responsible for our ultimate success or failure as to that concern.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>At the other end of Professor Edmondson's failure spectrum--"good failures" resulting from efforts to extend the frontiers of our knowledge--we should not be so fearful of failing that we avoid trying new or hard things merely because their very newness or difficulty increases the risk of failure. Don't let concern for protecting your grade point average dictate the courses you take. Challenge yourself, academically and in other ways. You may discover skills, talents, and joys you would otherwise miss out on. Your mortal experience will be a more productive part of your quest for perfection if you intentionally stretch yourself with new challenges, especially those that involve a real risk of failure. As someone once observed, "If you aren't in over your head, how do you know how tall you are?"<sup>18</sup><br><br>Maybe our most difficult challenge is to deal with the second category of failures--those that are not willful sin or intentional calculated risks but rather the unavoidable, uncontrollable failures that occur because of the messiness of life, because of factors beyond our direct control. What do you do when, for the first time in your life, you get an A− or a B or a D, even though you have worked very hard? Or when you try your best but you still don't make the Women's Chorus? Or when the relationship you are pursuing falls apart? Or even when all these things and more important ones seem to go wrong at the same time and you feel completely alone, overwhelmed, and totally a failure? What do you do then?<br><br>Let me suggest you follow the advice given in Hebrews 10:35: "Cast not away . . . your confidence." You have not arrived at this point in your lives without having accomplished much, as Peggy has just explained. I know you may sometimes feel like the least intelligent, least talented, and most socially awkward student who has ever set foot on this campus, but you were not admitted to this university on a whim. The process is better than that. And you are better than that. More important, you have the potential to be much better than that. Remembering what you have already accomplished and understanding your full potential can contribute to the development of the kind of emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual resilience that will allow you, in the words of the BYU mission statement, to meet "personal challenge and change."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Professor Martin E. P. Seligman, one of the founders of positive psychology, has observed that the most common characteristic of those who are able to overcome almost any kind of uncontrollable failure is that they are optimistic.<sup>20</sup> And the good news is that people can be taught to some degree "to think like optimists."<sup>21</sup> One way Professor Seligman suggests is by helping people view setbacks as things that are "[1] temporary, [2] local, and [3] changeable."<sup>22</sup> In other words, they react to failures by thinking, "[1] It's going away quickly, [2] it's just this one situation, and [3] I can do something about it."<sup>23</sup> That process, studies have shown, is aided by recalling past successes<sup>24</sup> and recognizing individual strengths that we have.<sup>25</sup><br><br>Eternal gospel truths, available to us through modern revelation, make this kind of optimistic thinking even easier. For example, we know that each of us "is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."<sup>26</sup> Thus we have much greater strengths and talents than we realize.<br><br>Moreover, we are promised that, from an eternal perspective, our "adversity and . . . afflictions shall be but a small moment."<sup>27</sup> Thus we can be certain that whatever we are going through will be temporary.<br><br>Finally, we can be assured that however we have failed, it can, from an eternal perspective, be changed. The Atonement is that powerful and that comprehensive. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland put it:<br><br><i>If you are lonely, please know you can find comfort. If you are discouraged, please know you can find hope. . . . If you feel you are broken, please know you can be mended.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Because of the Atonement, all failures are changeable and temporary, except the one that occurs when we give up. So whatever you do, don't you dare give up.<br><br>What I am suggesting is not simply an affirmation of the power of positive thinking; it is a recognition of the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ--the perspective it gives us, the truths it provides, and "the infinite virtue of [Christ's] atoning sacrifice"<sup>29</sup> that is available to us all. Yes, I am asking you to trust yourself more, but, more important, I am asking you to trust God. I urge you--in your moments of doubt and despair, in the times when you think you have failed and you think you can't make it right--to focus more on Him and less on yourselves.<br><br>Too often we ask the wrong question when we fail. We ask, "Am I good enough?" But the real question is, "Is God good enough?" Is He as good as He says He is? Can He really deliver on His promise that "all things" will "work together for [our] good"<sup>30</sup> if we will trust Him and strive to do the best we can and keep going whenever we fall short?<br><br>I testify that He is. God is as good, as powerful, as loving, as patient, and as consistent as He says He is. If we will but focus on the eternal truths He has made available to us, both through institutional revelation and through personal promptings and reassurances, He will turn all our failures into successes. I bear my witness that He lives and loves us with a love we cannot comprehend. He gave His Son so that we might move forward in our quest for perfection with full confidence and assurance that we will succeed despite our failures.<br><br>I bear my solemn witness of these truths and express my love and God's love for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was delivered on 6January 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 2014), 1; approved by the BYU Board of Trustees on November 4, 1981.<br><br>2.

<h1>igion - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to this wonderful student body of Brigham Young University. I bring you the love of President Thomas S. Monson. He prays for you, and I hope you pray for him.<br><br>My wife, Mary Anne, and I lived in Guatemala for five years. Elder Richard G. Scott visited while we were there, and together we toured the beautiful countries of El Salvador and Panama. On a Friday evening we had a devotional in Panama. We arrived at about 6:30 p.m., and the devotional was scheduled for 7 p.m.<br><br>As we entered the building and walked down the corridor, I looked into one of the classrooms and saw a little boy on his knees praying. I felt that I was on sacred ground, and I shut the door. We then went into the chapel, and shortly thereafter the little boy entered and sat behind us. We had a wonderful devotional with Elder Scott, and as it ended, I approached the little boy. This was our conversation:<br><br>"What is your name?"<br><br>"My name is Carlos Pitti."<br><br>"How old are you?"<br><br>"Thirteen years old."<br><br>"Are you here with your parents?"<br><br>"No, I am here with my brother."<br><br>"Why were you praying in the classroom?"<br><br>"I was praying that I would feel the Spirit during the devotional."<br><br>"Did you feel the Spirit?"<br><br>As tears ran down his cheeks from his big black eyes, he said, "Yes, I did."<br><br>I hope and pray that, like Carlos, you have prayed that you will feel the Spirit during our time together. The Holy Ghost can teach us most effectively if we have come prepared, as did my friend Carlos.<br><br>I was blessed, as you are being blessed, to attend Brigham Young University. I often reflect on my time here as a student. It was here that I started to study business, which led to my career. It was here that I was blessed with wonderful friends, class associates, professors, and Church leaders. It was here that one of my greatest blessings happened: I met my beloved Mary Anne Jackson. We dated here, we were engaged here, and we married on June 5, 1970, shortly after our graduation here.<br><br>You may ask why we didn't get married before we graduated. The answer is that Mary Anne had promised her father not to get married until after she had graduated. Jacob waited fourteen years for Rebekah, and I waited eighteen months for Mary Anne. I would have waited fourteen years.<br><br>I am in the process of working with someone to write my personal history. One of the chapters will be "Look What She Did with Me." The best thing I ever did was marry Mary Anne Jackson. I love you, Mary Anne.<br><br>A couple of years ago a young man--let's call him John--came to my office, having shortly returned from his mission. He was a student at this university.<br><br>He said to me, with great concern, "Elder Clarke, I need help. I loved my mission. It changed me. However, I am losing some of those sacred and special feelings that I felt in the mission field. I live in an apartment of returned missionaries. We don't pray together, and we don't read the scriptures together."<br><br>He was pleading, "Can you help me?"<br><br>He asked, "What can I do to feel like I felt in the mission field?"<br><br>I have seen this happen many times. It is not just a question for returned missionaries. His question was, "What can I do to be happy, feel the Holy Ghost, and be close to the Savior?"<br><br>This is a question we all should ask every day.<br><br>On that afternoon in my office we turned to James 1:27 and read:<br><br><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i><br><br>We then read in Alma 34:28:<br><br><i>And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</i><br><br>Pure religion includes caring for the poor and the needy.<br><br>We then reviewed the story you have all heard many times in John 21, in which Peter and others had gone fishing, had caught nothing, were told by the Savior to put the net on the other side of the boat, and then had caught 153 fish. Then there was a fish fry. Then Peter and the Savior were talking. The Savior knew He was instructing the soon-to-be prophet and president of the Church for one of the last times.<br><br>You remember the question asked by the Savior: "Peter, do you love me?"<br><br>The answer was, "Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee" (John 21:15).<br><br>The Savior then said, "Feed my lambs."<br><br>Two more times the same question was asked, and the Savior's instruction was a little bit different: "Feed my sheep" (verses 16 and 17).<br><br>Peter was really being instructed to practice pure religion, or to care for the people. The prophet of God today, as well as long ago, cares for and loves the people. President Thomas S. Monson is a great example of one who practices pure religion. He has spent his entire life loving and caring for people!<br><br>I have seen many returned missionaries and others like my friend John, who came to my office that day. If you ask missionaries why they loved their missions, almost always they will eventually say because of their love for the people. The day a missionary starts to care more about others, they become happy. That is the way it is for all of us. Our lives will always be happier if we care for and love others.<br><br>The opposite of caring for others is always thinking about oneself--my car, my studies, or my job. When it is always about "me," our ­connection with heaven isn't as strong as it could be.<br><br>That day in my office I told John that if he would practice pure religion, he would be happy and feel like he had felt on his mission. We went on to discuss pure religion as defined in James 1:27, Alma 34:28, and John 21.<br><br>I would give you the same advice that I discussed with my friend John that day. If you want to be happy, feel the Holy Ghost, and grow closer to the Savior, then practice pure religion.<br><br>From these scriptures we learn five key practices that can be defined as pure religion:<br><br>1. Care for and visit widows.<br><br>2. Help orphans.<br><br>3. Care for the needy and the poor.<br><br>4. Help lambs.<br><br>5. Help sheep.<br><br>Let me share some thoughts on each of these groups.<br><br>Many widows sit home every day waiting for someone to come or call. If I was a bishop at BYU, I would adopt many widows for my ward, and the calling for many would be to visit them weekly. This would be a calling with eternal significance and would have a much greater impact than a calling such as handing out hymnbooks or some other miscellaneous assignment.<br><br>John went back to BYU and acted upon what we had discussed. He sent me the following email:<br><br><i>Hi, Elder Clarke.</i><br><br><i>How are you? I hope all is well. It has been a while since I have written you, and I wanted to see how everything has been going. I feel you should know that I still think about our meeting last January. I felt the Spirit very strong in teaching me life's principles that we spoke of, and doing so has continued to bless my life. Each month I have learned different things from that conversation and our other conversations since. Visiting the widows and the elderly has been an incredible blessing. I have seen repayments of kindness many times over. I could go on, really, and fill this page with experiences. Thank you. It is truly a blessing to have a great friend.</i><br><br><i>I would like to share one experience, however, that you might enjoy. A few Sundays ago I went to an assisted-care facility for the elderly to read inspirational stories from the Ensign. The twelve or so of us began with a prayer, and I began to read to them. The Spirit over that hour entered gradually and powerfully, and the simple stories of faith turned into very powerful testimony builders. Many individuals felt a great amount of love and support from the Savior as the Spirit testified of simple truths and testimonies.</i><br><br><i>It touched my soul to be able to be an instrument for the Lord, because I definitely felt His love for those sweet people. As I was on my way out, a few commented that they wanted to adopt me! I had never known I was capable of feeling such love from and for strangers with whom I had little connection. But I felt the Savior's love for them, for those kind souls. It appeared clear to me that I would meet these individuals--now riddled by dementia, Alzheimer's, and physical ailments--on the other side. I would see their husbands and wives, who have been looking over them from the other side of the veil. I felt very much the presence of my grandfather--whom I had never met--as I sat with my grandmother, and his spirit strengthened me and supported me. I knew he was thankful for my simple visit.</i><br><br><i>Who knew that I could find such tender mercies? It seems so meaningless to come home after something like that and just turn on the TV or tune out in some other way. It has changed me to realize that these tender experiences are available at all moments of the day as we, as Saints, strive to focus and help others in some way.</i><br><br><i>As I left that room that day, all of the elderly wished for my prompt return. They had bright smiles and warm hearts. They were thankful. In the hallway, your words echoed in my heart: "They will do more for you than you will ever be able to do for them." What a blessing true service is!</i><br><br>Just before Christmas I was invited to a rest home, where I also had the opportunity to visit many widows. I felt the same way that John felt. You can do this too, and the Lord will bless you as He blessed John and me.<br><br>Orphans may be hard to find here in Provo, but there are many throughout the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could connect with or write one regularly? Big Brothers and Big Sisters is a way to connect with those who need a mentor.<br><br>When our son, Nate, returned home from his mission, he had the same feelings as my friend John. Nate decided to become a Big Brother, and that experience changed his college experience. Nate chose to create an experience in which he had the opportunity to think about someone beside himself. Now that he is married, Nate and his wife, Carla, have adopted again through Big Brothers and Big Sisters. It has been a great blessing for them in their marriage to share what they have with those in need.<br><br>When Mary Anne and I served in the Bolivia Santa Cruz Mission, we had a missionary who was an orphan boy. He had no family. The Lord assigned him to be Elder Hawkins' trainer. I don't think he was the best trainer, but Elder Hawkins was the best companion for an orphan boy who had become one of the Lord's missionaries. Elder Hawkins' parents adopted this missionary and wrote to him during his mission and have continued to write to him for the past fifteen years. This orphan has become part of Elder Hawkins' family for all these years! This orphan boy, because of Elder Hawkins and his family, has been loved and cared for and is now happily married, employed, and active in the gospel of Jesus Christ. We all can help change little orphan boys!<br><br>As we review the scriptures, we are constantly reminded of the importance of helping the poor and the needy. At our last general conference, Elder Holland's talk was entitled, "Are We Not All Beggars?" This talk is an excellent reminder of our responsibility to help the poor and the needy. We should review it regularly. One way that we could increase our help to the poor and the needy would be to pay a generous fast offering.<br><br>Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The first year that I came into this valley I had not flour enough to last my family until ­harvest . . . , and persons were coming to my house every day for bread. I had the blues about [it] one day; I went down to the old fort, and by the time I got back to my house I was completely cured. I said to my wife, "Do not let a person come here for food and go away empty handed, for if you do we shall suffer before harvest; but if you give to every individual that comes we shall have enough to last us through." . . .</i><br><br><i>I intend to keep doing so, that my bread may hold out, for if I do not I shall come short.</i><br><br><i>Do you believe that principle? I know it is true, because I have proven it so many times.</i> [JD 3:332–33]<br><br>The following experience was posted on a Christian website by a Hospice of Metro Denver physician:<br><br><i>I just had one of the most amazing experiences of my life and wanted to share it with my family and dearest friends: I was driving home from a meeting this evening about five, stuck in traffic on Colorado Boulevard, and the car started to choke and splutter and die. I barely managed to coast . . . into a gas station, glad only that I would not be blocking traffic and would have a somewhat warm spot to wait for the tow truck. It wouldn't even turn over.</i><br><br><i>Before I could make the call, I saw a woman walking out of the "quickie mart" building, and it looked like she slipped on some ice and fell into a gas pump, so I got out to see if she was okay. When I got there, it looked more like she had been overcome by sobs than that she had fallen; she was a young woman who looked really haggard with dark circles under her eyes. She dropped something as I helped her up, and I picked it up to give it to her. It was a nickel.</i><br><br><i>At that moment, everything came into focus for me: the crying woman, the ancient Suburban crammed full of stuff with three kids in the back (one in a car seat), and the gas pump reading $4.95. I asked her if she was okay and if she needed help, and she just kept saying, "I don't want my kids to see me crying," so we stood on the other side of the pump from her car. She said she was driving to California and that things were very hard for her right now.</i><br><br><i>So I asked, "And you were praying?" That made her back away from me a little, but I assured her I was not a crazy person and said, "He heard you, and He sent me."</i><br><br><i>I took out my card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so she could fill up her car completely and while it was fueling walked to the next-door McDonald's and bought two big bags of food, some gift certificates for more, and a big cup of coffee. She gave the food to the kids in the car, who attacked it like wolves, and we stood by the pump eating fries and talking a little. She told me her name and that she lived in Kansas City.</i><br><br><i>Her boyfriend had left two months ago, and she had not been able to make ends meet. She knew she wouldn't have money to pay rent on January 1, and, finally, in desperation had called her parents, with whom she had not spoken in about five years. They lived in California and said she could come live with them and try to get on her feet there. So she packed up everything she owned in the car. She told the kids they were going to California for Christmas, but not that they were going to live there.</i><br><br><i>I gave her my gloves and a little hug and said a quick prayer with her for safety on the road. As I was walking over to my car, she said, "So, are you like an angel or something?"</i><br><br><i>This definitely made me cry. I said, "Sweetie, at this time of year angels are really busy, so sometimes God uses regular people."</i><br><br><i>It was so incredible to be a part of someone else's miracle. And, of course, you guessed it, when I got in my car, it started right away and got me home with no problem. I'll put it in the shop tomorrow to check, but I suspect the mechanic won't find anything wrong.</i><br><br><i>Sometimes the angels fly close enough to you that you can hear the flutter of their wings.</i> ["Friends Are God's Way of Taking Care of Us," lisburn.com/stories/friends_are_gods_way.html]<br><br>Does the Lord trust us to be an answer to someone else's prayer? Can He count on us to follow the promptings of the Spirit? The more we follow the Spirit's promptings, the more opportunities the Lord will present to us to be the answer to someone else's prayer.<br><br>Not long ago, when President Monson addressed the General Authorities, his one subject was the youth. The youth have many temptations like you do. The young lambs are in need of nourishment.<br><br>When Jesus had His conversation with Peter, it is interesting that His first counsel to Peter was, "Feed my lambs." The Savior knew that if we keep the lambs, we won't have to look for lost sheep. Some of us may have younger brothers or sisters, nephews, nieces, or other young people we know who need help. May we be great examples for them and may we find the lambs who need our help.<br><br>I meet with young people everywhere. When I ask them who has helped them, many talk about individuals like you. Will you find and help a lamb?<br><br>We recently went to see the <i>Savior of the World</i> production at the LDS Conference Center. In this presentation of the birth of the Savior it was emphasized that the lowly shepherds were the people the Lord trusted to share the message that the Savior had been born. The shepherds were dependable and trustworthy, and the Lord knew that He could count on them to proclaim the important message. Are we as shepherds trustworthy enough to care for the lambs and the sheep as the Savior has asked us to do?<br><br>Some time ago one of our daughters was assigned to speak on Christmas Sunday. The topic was "How can we become shepherds this Christmas season?" Let me quote from her talk:<br><br><i>The highlight of Christmas at the Clarkes was always Christmas Eve. The day was spent baking, cooking, wrapping, and busily getting everything ready for the evening ahead. We would bundle up in our hats and gloves and head to God's Acre, the square in the center of town with a different denomination of church on each of the four corners. The town band would play Christmas carols, and people of all faiths would gather and sing together. All were there for the same purpose: to celebrate the birth of our Savior. But this was just the beginning of the evening.</i><br><br><i>After caroling, we would head back home, where the feast we had been working on all day would quickly come together for all to enjoy. The month before, my parents would begin asking around the ward to find out who did not have somewhere to go for Christmas Eve. Whoever they might be, they were always invited to our home for the festivities. We lived on the East Coast, far from our relatives, so my parents decided we would be family to those around us, and they would be family for us.</i><br><br><i>One year when my older siblings were at college and heading home for the holidays, it was mentioned that maybe Christmas Eve would be just for our family this year.</i><br><br><i>When Christie arrived home from BYU, she asked Mom, "Who is coming for Christmas Eve?"</i><br><br><i>My mother commented that this year we were going to have just our family because three of our siblings had been away.</i><br><br><i>Christie then said, "But Mom, what will our Iranian friends do? What will the Toomeys do? And what will Rune do for Christmas Eve?"</i><br><br><i>These people were counting on us, and we couldn't change our tradition. Christie had felt the wondrous blessings of having these special sheep in our home for Christmas, and it meant everything to her!</i><br><br><i>The feast would always be for at least forty or so. In addition to the families that were invited, my ­parents always invited the local zone of missionaries to our home for Christmas Eve. After dinner we would move to the living room for the Christmas program.</i><br><br><i>The evening was centered on the true meaning of Christmas: celebrating the birth of our Savior. My dad would read the Christmas story from Luke, and then we would go around the room with everyone having the opportunity to share their testimony of Jesus Christ. At the end of the evening everyone received a gift.</i><br><br><i>In this story--the story of the Christmas Eves of my childhood--the shepherds are my parents. They opened up their home to those who had nowhere else to go. These people were family and were treated as such.</i><br><br><i>We have all been touched by shepherds in our lives, and we have all been shepherds at times. But at this holiday season I hope we can all try to be as the shepherds of Bethlehem and proclaim the birth of our Savior--not only through our words but also through our actions, by inviting all into the fold.</i><br><br>We just passed the Christmas season--and Bill Toomey was in our home once again. This is a time of the year when we tend to practice pure religion. There is a country song called "I Wish It Was Christmas All Year Long." Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could keep that special Christmas spirit all year round?<br><br>The question asked by the Savior of Peter could be asked of each of us: "Do you love me?" As we practice pure religion by caring for and visiting widows, helping orphans, caring for the poor and the needy, and helping lambs and sheep, we will show Him that we love Him! As we do this, we will be happy, feel the Holy Ghost, and feel closer to the Savior.<br><br>I would like to bear my testimony to you, my young friends, that as we practice pure religion, we make a connection with heaven that is made in no other way. I testify to you that this is the true Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth today. I know that Thomas S. Monson is God's prophet. I have watched, I have listened, I have felt, and I know.<br><br>I know that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. There was one October day when I was in the Sacred Grove alone. No one else was there. Just me. I knelt and I prayed. I know that the Father and the Son came to Joseph Smith. I love Joseph Smith.<br><br>But that which is most sacred to me is my testimony of Jesus Christ. In Alma 7:7 it says that there will be many things that will come to pass, and then it says, "There is one thing which is of more importance than they all." It goes on to talk about the life and birth and atonement of Jesus Christ. I testify that that which is most important of them all is Jesus Christ. I love Him. I am thankful that He has given me the opportunity to serve Him. May we follow Him and do as He has asked us to do. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Don R. Clarke was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 13 January 2015.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ue Doctrine, Understood, Changes Attitudes and Behavior&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. My thanks go to those who provided the music this morning. Their music has helped to bring the Spirit to this meeting. I would hope to speak by that Spirit today.<br><br>My late friend Robert J. Matthews, who taught religion here at BYU, used to say, "If I speak by the Spirit and you listen by the Spirit, you will hear things better than I say them." I pray that that can happen today.<br><br>I thought it appropriate to begin with a little poem written by a young man that I think might illustrate what sometimes may happen in parents' attempts to change the behavior of their children. He wrote:<br><br><i>My parents told me not to smoke--</i><br><i>I don't. </i><br><i>Nor listen to a naughty joke--</i><br><i>I don't. </i><br><i>They made it plain I must not wink</i><br><i>At pretty girls, or even think</i><br><i>About intoxicating drink--</i><br><i>I don't. </i><br><i>To dance and flirt is very wrong--</i><br><i>I don't. </i><br><br><i>Wild youths chase women, wine and song--</i><br><i>I don't. </i><br><i>I kiss no girls, not even one--</i><br><i>I do not know how it is done--</i><br><i>You wouldn't think I had much fun--</i><br><i>I DON'T. </i><br>["I Don't," <i>Goldendale Sentinel</i> (Klickatat County, Washington), 24 October 1918, 1, gld.stparchive.com/Archive/GLD/GLD10241918P01.php]<br><br>Now, you see that this young man's behavior was changed, but not his attitude. What is needed is a change in attitude as well as behavior. So I pose this question: What causes a change in attitude and behavior?<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer stated:<br><br><i>True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. </i><br><br><i>The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior. ... That is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel.</i> ["Little Children," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1986, 17]<br><br>The purpose of my presentation today is to explore four points of doctrine as found in the scriptures and in the words of the Brethren.<br><h2><b>Principle Number 1: Draw upon the Power of the Word Daily</b></h2><br>The prophet Mormon wrote:<br><br><i>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i> [Alma 31:5]<br><br>When I taught seminary years ago, I wanted to show the youth the power of the word that Alma described. I wanted to show them that if they would make the word of God (as found in the scriptures) a part of their lives, it would change them. I didn't know exactly how to do that, but I tried this way.<br><br>On the first day of class I gave them a blank sheet of paper and said to them, "Be honest in your writing here. I'm not going to look at this. This is for you only. Write down your honest feelings about religion--about God, Christ, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, the Church, or anything you want. Fold it over, staple it, and put your name and date on the outside. I will file it away and save it for you, but I will give it back to you at the end of the year."<br><br>For the next nine months we studied the scriptures every day. We marked them. We noted them. The students were challenged to pray every day, morning and night, on their knees, out loud, and read a chapter of scripture each day on their own for nine months.<br><br>On the last day of class I gave them a sheet of paper (I don't even know if they remembered doing this at the beginning of the year), and I said, "Now don't try to impress anybody here. Just be honest. Write your feelings about God, the Church, Christ, the gospel, or anything you'd like."<br><br>When they got done, I handed them back their previous papers from nine months earlier. They opened them up and made a comparison.<br><br>I hadn't intended to read any of them, but a girl named Julie came to me with tears in her eyes and said, "I want you to see this."<br><br>Here was her first response:<br><br><i>I guess I sometimes wonder if Christ really does live. I don't know for sure, and I have always wondered since I was old enough to even think about it. ... I also wonder if this is the true church or not. Everything we are told to do seems right, but I still have doubts. </i><br><br>After nine months of studying the scriptures in seminary, she wrote, in part:<br><br><i>I know God lives and His Son, Jesus Christ, is my Brother and He knows me and He cares about me. Through prayer I know He will guide us and show us the right way through His prophets, who I know are called of God. I know He loves each of us in a very special way. </i><br><br><i>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true church, and I know it without a doubt. It was restored by Joseph Smith, who I know was a true prophet. </i><br><br>I counted nine times that she said, "I know." That is the power of the word in a young lady's life.<br><br>I had a similar experience in a fifth-period class, later in the day. An afternoon class in a hot climate is not always the optimal setting for keeping students' attention. As a matter of fact, this class was a particular challenge to me. As I considered my role in their temporal salvation (because they seemed so impossible to reach), I thought that the only way I could ever help save them would be to wait until they all died and then do work for the dead. That, however, was not a viable option. But I gave them the same challenge I had given the rest of the classes and continued to teach them.<br><br>At the end of the year a young man named Larry, who was in that fifth-period class, came to me and said, "You might want to look at this."<br><br>Here is his first response:<br><br><i>I don't really know there's a God. I only go to church to make my mom and dad happy. I wish I had a testimony, but I don't. Sometimes I feel like I have an important job on earth, but I don't know what it is. I'm always wanting to do something wrong. </i><br><br>I am an eyewitness to the "always wanting to do something wrong" part.<br><br>Nine months later this young man wrote:<br><br><i>I know the Church is true. I have a testimony of it. I love my Big Brother and my Heavenly Father, and I know They live. I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and I have a testimony of it. </i><br><br><i>I love this church with all my life. Some say they do not know if they would give their life for it, but I know--if need be, and my Father willed it--I would. </i><br><br>That is the power of the word in a young man's life.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson promised:<br><br><i>When individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, these other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow.</i> ["The Power of the Word," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1986, 81]<br><br>I add my testimony that there is power in the word that can be drawn upon daily.<br><h2><b>Principle Number 2: Let the Scriptures and the Holy Ghost Tell You All Things That You Should Do</b></h2><br>The prophet Nephi wrote:<br><br><i>Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will <b>tell</b> you <b>all things</b> what ye should do.... </i><br><br><i>. . . Receive the Holy Ghost,</i> [and] <i>it will <b>show</b> unto you <b>all things</b> what ye should do.</i> [2 Nephi 32:3, 5; emphasis added]<br><br>I would like to try to illustrate this principle with a personal experience.<br><br>Many years ago an invitation had come to me to leave our home in Utah, where I was teaching seminary, and move to Arizona to teach institute in Tucson. My wife and I had prayerfully decided this was the right thing to do. It was a little frightening to leave parents, friends, and security and move to a desert land where we knew no one.<br><br>We traveled to Tucson to find our new home. Upon our arrival in Tucson we met with a real estate agent. After days of searching we could find nothing in our price range that even came close to meeting our family's needs--as far as location, neighborhood, schools, and so on. I wasn't used to "desert landscape." The homes had cactus and rock gardens instead of trees and grass lawns. My faith that this move was the right decision began to waver. We were out of options and out of time. The agent suggested that we pick one or two of the homes we liked, revisit them, and make a decision. The problem was that I hadn't liked any of them. I was depressed and heartsick. I needed help. I couldn't sleep.<br><br>In the motel room, in the middle of the night, I turned to the scriptures for help. I read from several places, including Hebrews 11, about faith. Nothing seemed to help. Then it happened. I was reading Ether 12 in the Book of Mormon about faith. I came to verse 32. I read, "And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house..."<br><br>I stopped. I looked up. The Lord had spoken to my soul. A house was prepared. I didn't know how or where or what was to happen, but I knew a house was prepared. I didn't say anything to my wife.<br><br>The next morning we met the agent and drove to a house out on Bear Trail that my wife remembered as being a possibility of something that might work. As we drove up on a rock driveway, an enormous reptile dropped off a saguaro cactus right in front of the house and scurried off into the desert. I remember thinking, "Is this reptile a future playmate for my young children?"<br><br>We surveyed the house. Debbie went inside while I checked over the outside.<br><br>I noticed the roof shingles were corroded from the leaking swamp cooler. The cedar fence was propped up by two-by-four boards. There was a crack in the foundation. The swimming pool was filled with black algae.<br><br>I thought, "Well, this is it. We need to decide."<br><br>No one was near, so I knelt in prayer. I begged for the Lord to let me know if this was the "house prepared." As I opened my eyes and arose from my knees, I saw a magazine stuck in a bush. Could the magazine contain direction? I went to the bush and opened the magazine. It was a pornographic magazine. I closed the magazine, put it back in the bush, went into the house, and announced to my wife, "This is not the house."<br><br>My wife said, "How do you know?"<br><br>I said, "It's a 'bush' thing. I'll explain later."<br><br>We then returned to the agent's car to check out one new listing. En route to the new listing we passed through a neighborhood that reminded me of our home in Utah. There were sidewalks, lawns, and children playing. The street had such a good spirit about it. I asked the agent if there was anything for sale in this area.<br><br>She said, "No."<br><br>We rounded a corner, and I saw a house with a "for sale" sign.<br><br>I asked, "What about this one?"<br><br>She said, "I have no idea. It is not listed."<br><br>We copied down the number and made a call. The agent asked the owner why it wasn't listed. She said they were planning to sell but that the home wasn't ready to show. But for "some reason" her agent had come early that morning and posted the "for sale" sign. Our agent asked if we could come see it. She agreed to let us come right then.<br><br>After we pulled into the driveway and got out of the car, I said to my wife, "This is the house. I know it. I couldn't be any more sure than Moses and the burning bush."<br><br>She looked at me and said, "This bush thing again?"<br><br>We loved the house. Through the agent we made an offer. We returned to the motel to wait for the agent's call. I was sitting by the swimming pool at the motel. The agent finally called and told us they had accepted our offer. I was ecstatic. I said I wanted to take pictures of the home to show our children, but I had no idea of the address of the property. I asked if she could give it to me.<br><br>The agent said, "Do you have something to write on?"<br><br>I did, and she gave me the address.<br><br>The address was 1509 South Burning Tree Avenue.<br><br>I said, "Burning Tree as in Burning Bush?"<br><br>She said, "Yes."<br><br>I about fell in the pool.<br><br>A house had been prepared. The Lord had spoken to my soul through Ether 12:32.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>The idea that scripture reading can lead to inspiration and revelation opens the door to the truth that a scripture is not limited to what it meant when it was written but may also include what that scripture means to a reader today. Even more, scripture reading may also lead to current revelation on whatever else the Lord wishes to communicate to the reader at that time. We do not overstate the point when we say that the scriptures can be a Urim and Thummim to assist each of us to receive personal revelation.</i> ["Scripture Reading and Revelation," <i>Ensign,</i> January 1995, 8]<br><br>I add my testimony that, as Nephi said, through the words of scripture and the Holy Ghost you can be told and shown all things you should do.<br><h2><b>Principle Number 3: Use the Scriptures to Chase Darkness from Your Life</b></h2><br>Doctrine and Covenants 50:23–25 reads:<br><br><i>And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. </i><br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light....</i><br><br><i>. . . And I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you. </i><br><br>Many years ago I was teaching released-time seminary. Life was good. I was married to a wonderful woman. We had been blessed with four small children. I was blessed to study and teach from the scriptures every day.<br><br>I came home from school one day to discover we were expecting child number five. There was good news and bad news. The good news was the blessing of another child. The bad news was that my wife got extremely ill during pregnancies. I knew it was going to be a rough road ahead. It seemed that everything that could go wrong did go wrong during the first three months of Debbie's pregnancy. This included the following:<br><br>1. Debbie was sick with morning sickness. She was in bed for more than four weeks and couldn't even sit up.<br><br>2. I had taken a leave of absence from teaching seminary to get my doctoral degree. I was back in graduate school carrying fifteen credit hours.<br><br>3. I was attempting to fill the role of mother while Debbie was ill. This included cleaning the house, doing laundry, fixing meals, tending kids, running errands, fulfilling nursemaid duties, and so on.<br><br>4. The dishwasher broke. I had no money to repair it. Dishes were done by hand.<br><br>5. Jana got an ear infection. She couldn't hear me. I had to take her to the doctor.<br><br>6. I had to "farm out" the two youngest girls--ages two and four--during the day for different ward members to tend.<br><br>7. Because of all of the turmoil, I was up five to six times each night helping Debbie and consoling the children.<br><br>8. Jeremy, then age six, was throwing rocks at an icicle on the front of the house and broke the large picture window in the living room.<br><br>9. Jeremy also was chasing Jana and bumped a shelf of figurines. They crashed to the floor. My wife asked, "What was that?" I said, "Oh, nothing, dear." The pile of pieces remained in a box for weeks awaiting the day when I would have time to glue them back together--which never happened.<br><br>10. Julie, age two, became ill. I took her to the doctor.<br><br>11. I had to take Debbie to the hospital several times for intravenous hydration. With all the vomiting, she got dehydrated regularly.<br><br>12. I was always at least 500 pages behind in my reading.<br><br>13. I was supposed to be doing a literature search for my dissertation.<br><br>14. I was serving as elders quorum president. Many hours of service were required.<br><br>15. Other things happened. A wind came up and blew the screen door right off the front of our house. It was lying out in the driveway.<br><br>16. I was in an education class in which I had to practice giving individualized intelligence tests. I tested most of the kids in the neighborhood. I began to doubt my own intelligence.<br><br>17. The straw that broke the camel's back, I think, was that our scruffy little mongrel dog named Fluffy began her breeding cycle. We had no fence. It seemed as if we had male dog visitors from everywhere, all enamored with Fluffy.<br><br>I was at an all-time low. When you are at the bottom, there is no more bottom. I was drowning, being pulled down by an overwhelming whirlpool of duties that I couldn't keep up with. And in the process I hadn't opened a book of scripture in more than four weeks. Prior to all of this I had committed to teach an adult evening class on the Book of Mormon. It was too much. I felt I couldn't do it, but I was committed.<br><br>So the night before the class was to begin, I found myself preparing during the only quiet time available: between midnight and 2 a.m. After about an hour of study I suddenly stopped. Something was different--very different. It took a few moments for me to realize what was happening. Then it came to me like a revelation from heaven. For the first time in four weeks I wasn't depressed. It was also the first time in four weeks that I had immersed myself in scripture study. Because of the tailspin of life I had found myself in, I felt I had no time to study the scriptures. I was barely surviving day to day. I felt it was impossible to allot any time for scripture study.<br><br>I submit to you that the following words of President Spencer W. Kimball are true:<br><br><i>There are blessings that come from immersing ourselves in the scriptures. The distance narrows between ourselves and our Father in Heaven. Our spirituality shines brighter. We love more intensely those whom we should love. It is much easier to follow counsel. The lessons of life are learned more readily and surely.</i> ["Men of Example," address to religious educators, Temple Square Assembly Hall, 12 September 1975, 2; included in <i>Charge to Religious Educators,</i> 3d ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1994), 23]<br><br>I witnessed the blessing of immersing myself in the scriptures. I testify that the light from the Book of Mormon helped chase darkness from me. I acknowledge that scripture study alone cannot resolve all despair and depression, but I do know that when I was finally compelled "to act" and "not to be acted upon" (see 2 Nephi 2:26), it was the keystone--the Book of Mormon--that led me back to the Cornerstone, Jesus Christ (see Ephesians 2:20).<br><h2><b>Principle Number 4: During Scripture Study, Search for Types of Christ</b></h2><br>The prophet Nephi said:<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ ...; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.</i> [2 Nephi 11:4]<br><br>I know his statement to be true. When we can grasp the ideas that Christ is the Master Teacher, the universe is His classroom, and the curriculum is the Atonement, we will never read the scriptures the same way again.<br><br>I believe you can find types of Christ in events, travels, topography, seasons, people, names, and so forth. For example, in the Bible Dictionary under "Pauline Epistles" for the book of Hebrews, we read that Israel's journey typifies our journey toward eternal life (see 6b). Israel left Canaan, went to Egypt, and fell into bondage. They were led from bondage by Moses, were purified in the desert, and then returned to their home in Canaan. Likewise, we leave God's presence, enter a fallen telestial world, are delivered from spiritual bondage by Jesus, pass through a purifying terrestrial millennium, and return to God's celestial presence.<br><br>Let's look at Moses as a symbol or type of Christ and compare the two deliverers. Moses was Israel's physical deliverer. Jesus is our spiritual deliverer.<br><br>Moses's first plague to get Israel out of Egypt was turning water into blood. Jesus's first miracle in His ministry was turning water into wine.<br><br>Moses's last plague was the death of the firstborn. Jesus's last miracle was the resurrection of the Firstborn.<br><br>How did Moses free Israel from Egyptian bondage? He had the Israelites take a lamb--male, unblemished, firstborn, with no broken bones--and sacrifice this lamb by shedding its blood. The Israelites then put the blood of the lamb on the lintel and the two side posts of each of their doors. When they did that, the destroyer passed over them. The blood of the lamb saved them from physical death. In our lives we have to accept the Lamb of God--Jesus Christ--and symbolically put the blood of His Atonement on the doorframes of our lives. The blood of the Lamb of God will save us from spiritual death.<br><br>Those lambs used for sacrifice had to be firstborn. I don't know if you have considered Jesus's birth in the light of His being the Lamb of God. To whom did the angels go to announce the birth of the Lamb of God? Specific shepherds were assigned to tend the flocks of sheep to be used in temple sacrifice. Only certified firstborn lambs could be used. The shepherds were the eyewitnesses of which lambs were firstborn. So when the Lamb of God was born, where did the angels go? To the shepherds. Why? Because that was their job--to witness the birth of firstborn lambs.<br><br>Moses tells us in Leviticus 1:11 that the lambs to be used for sacrifice were to be slain on the north side of the altar. Where do you suppose Jesus, the Lamb of God, was sacrificed? The Crucifixion took place just north of the temple altar in Jerusalem at a place called Golgotha. The Lamb of God was sacrificed north of the temple altar. All things testify of Christ.<br><br>After Israel left Egyptian bondage, they went to the borders of the Red Sea. In the movie <i>The Ten Commandments,</i> Yul Brynner played the part of Pharaoh and said, "The god of Moses is a poor general to leave him no retreat."<br><br>Not really. Moses went there on purpose. Why? Because they had to go through the Red Sea. Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 10:1–2 that Israel passing through the Red Sea was a symbol of a baptism by water and a baptism by fire. Israel was saved by water. That is why there had to be a wall of water on each side. Israel was "baptized by immersion" in the Red Sea. The fire held the Egyptians back. Hence Israel was also saved by fire. It is the same with each of us. We need to be saved through a baptism of water and a baptism of fire.<br><br>When Israel got to the borders of the Red Sea, the pillar of fire came around behind them. There was first a separation of light and darkness. It was light to the Israelites going through the Red Sea, but it was darkness to the Egyptians. What did God do on the first day of creation? He separated the light from the darkness. What did God then do on the second day of creation? He separated the waters from the waters. What did Moses do? He separated the waters from the waters, and Israel went through on dry ground.<br><br>They went into the wilderness. The wilderness is a symbol of purification. They were there forty years. When we get into the Millennium, we will have a thousand years of purification.<br><br>What did they eat while they were in the wilderness? They ate manna. What is manna? It is bread from heaven. Who is Jesus? He is the Bread of Life. Where did He come from? Heaven. And where was He born? He was born in Bethlehem. And what does the name Bethlehem mean? Bethlehem means "House of Bread." By chance? I don't think so.<br><br>What did they drink? They drank water. Who is the Living Water? It is Jesus (see John 4:14). Where did they get the water? From a rock (see Exodus 17:6). Who is the rock? The Rock is Christ (see Helaman 5:12). By chance? I don't think so.<br><br>When Israel went into the promised land, they went through the Jordan River. Why go through a river? You have to be "born again" (see John 3:1–5). Who led them through the river? It was Joshua. Joshua is the Hebrew name for the Greek word <i>Jesus.</i> It was "Jesus" who caused them to be born again and led them through the Jordan River back home to the land of their fathers. They crossed the river at Bethabara--the same place where Jesus would later be baptized. That section of the Jordan River is the lowest body of freshwater on earth. Elder Russell M. Nelson taught that Jesus's baptism at Bethabara symbolized His descending below all things (see "Self-Mastery," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1985, 32). All things testify of Christ.<br><br>Consider names--simple names, like Joseph Smith. Joseph in Hebrew is Yoseph. Yoseph means "may God add sons." A "smith" is someone who forges or fashions or beats something out of raw material. So if you are God and you want to establish a kingdom out of raw material and then add sons to it, how do you describe that? "Joseph Smith."<br><br>What does Hyrum mean? Hyrum means "my brother is exalted." By chance? I don't think so.<br><br>Consider the seasons. When was Joseph born? Joseph was born at the winter solstice, when light is coming into the world. What was the sign to the Nephites when Jesus was born? It was three days of light. When was Joseph killed? Joseph was killed at the summer solstice, when light is going out of the world. What was the sign to the Nephites at Jesus's death? It was three days of darkness. All things testify of Christ.<br><br>Moses 6:63 states, "All things ... bear record of [Christ], both things ... in the heavens above, ... on the earth, ... in the earth, and ... under the earth."<br><br>The sun itself is a type of Christ. It comes from the east. Christ will also come from the east. The sun gives light and life to all things. Its heat can also consume all things. (Those who live in Arizona understand that.) It does both. The Light of Christ gives "life to all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:13). Christ's glory will also consume the wicked at His Second Coming (see D&amp;amp;C 5:19). People whose lives are filled with darkness will be destroyed by the light. People whose lives are full of light will be saved by that light--"as by fire," to use Nephi's words (1 Nephi 22:17). Doctrine and Covenants 88:25 states that "the earth abideth the law of a celestial kingdom." Well, what does the earth do? The earth revolves around the sun (s-u-n). What should we do if we are to abide by the law of a celestial kingdom? Our lives should also revolve around the Son (s-o-n).<br><br>The universe was designed to testify of Christ. Consider hibernation. Every creature--every squirrel, insect, snake, or bear--that hibernates and lies dormant during the winter appears to be dead. Each one that comes alive again in the spring testifies of Christ and His Resurrection. Every tree, every plant, every leaf that becomes green each spring--all testify of Christ. Do you think it was by chance that all of these things come to life after appearing to be dead at the same time of year when Jesus came alive again? I don't think so. All things testify of Christ.<br><br>Why do you go to bed at night? Because you are tired? No. You symbolically die every night.<br><br>Why do you get up in the morning? To go to school? No. You symbolically resurrect every morning.<br><br>Have you ever looked at your roommates when they are sleeping? They look dead. Arising from sleep every morning is a symbol we are so close to that we don't even recognize that we symbolically resurrect every morning. Those of you who have roommates who sleep past noon now know why we have to have the morning and the afternoon of the First Resurrection. That's just a joke, but it is no joke that "all things ... are the typifying of him" (2 Nephi 11:4). All things testify of Christ. I add my testimony that that is true.<br><br>In conclusion I would like to issue a challenge--one last heartfelt plea. Forty-two years ago I made a terrible mistake. I was a student at a nearby university. On this very day, January 20, at this very hour, I was standing beside my mother's hospital bed. She was dying. She was in a coma, in an intensive care unit, following complications from surgery. I was holding her hand and praying that she would regain consciousness. I longed to tell her that I loved her. I had been prompted by the Spirit several times before her surgery to do so, but I had resisted the prompting. I had reflected on the last time I had said those words to her. To my best recollection I was in third grade. I had written a little poem: "Of all the mothers kind and true, you are the best and I love you."<br><br>My mother died forty-two years ago tomorrow on January 21, 1973. I lost a great opportunity as a result of resisting a prompting of the Spirit. How does that apply to you here today? My hope is that each one of you today has felt a prompting of the Spirit--hopefully a prompting to improve your life through scripture study. My prayer is that you will respond to that prompting of the Spirit and not resist it. I pray that you will not carry with you a regret of resisting a spiritual prompting like I have all these years.<br><br>My challenge to you is to study the scriptures daily, draw upon the word daily, let the words of Christ tell you all things that you should do, and drive darkness from your life. May you always remember that all things testify of Christ. I pray that your consequent understanding of true doctrine will change both your attitude and your behavior. And I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Todd B.

<br>
<br>
Every April the Area Seventies from throughout the world gather in Salt Lake City, along with the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies, for instruction from members of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presidency of the Seventy. The instruction focuses on the most fundamental and most pressing issues of the Church--things like temple work, strengthening members, the Atonement, and hastening the work of salvation. It is a privilege to sit at the feet of these inspired leaders and to learn what is on their minds and in their hearts.<br><br>Two years ago, in April 2013, President Thomas S. Monson addressed the group and spent all of his time talking about just one topic: you--the youth of the Church. Think about that. Of all the important things that President Monson could have addressed--missionary work, temples, or Church leadership--he said that it was the youth of the Church that had been on his mind the most. He noted that as youth today, you are living in a time of infinite promise, a time when you will face unique challenges. He observed that you are truly a royal generation, reserved to come forth in this special time for particular purposes.<br><br>President Monson's remarks reminded me of two comments made by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Speaking to youth at a BYU fireside a number of years ago, Elder Maxwell said:<br><br><i>The highest compliment I can pay to you is that God has placed you here and now at this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is about to happen in which you will be involved and concerning which you will have some great influence.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>In another setting Elder Maxwell provided some additional context for that statement. Referring to the early days of this dispensation, he stated:<br><br><i>The Church has done many difficult things, and from these achievements one would not wish to detract. But all the easy things the Church has had to do have been done. From now on it is high adventure!</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Now, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the case. Those early stalwart Church members faced challenges that were daunting--challenges that would test the souls of the most valiant of us. However, Elder Maxwell did say that all the "easy things" that needed to be done have been done. "From now on, it <i>is</i> high adventure!" You have been reserved to come to earth at this time of high adventure because God knows you are capable of meeting the challenges which that adventure will bring.<br><br>Today I would like to discuss with you a few ideas about what you might do to prepare yourselves to successfully encounter the high adventure that lies ahead of you, both individually and as members of God's kingdom here on earth.<br><br>My advice begins with a scriptural admonition, one that some of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago: "Stand in holy places."<sup>3</sup> If you are to succeed in your role in the high adventure that is in your future, you must be grounded in the strength that comes from worthily being in holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit. As the Church handbook makes clear, those "holy places include temples . . . and chapels."<sup>4</sup> Regular church and temple attendance will bring great power in your lives--power you will need to face both the everyday and the extraordinary challenges you will encounter.<br><br>But in today's world, more will be expected of you than to just stand in holy places. My plea is not just that you stand in holy places but that you make holy the places in which you stand.<br><br>As Sister Sharon G. Larsen, a former member of the Young Women general presidency, once explained:<br><br><i>Holy places can be wherever you are--alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends. The road to Jericho was treacherous and formidable. Thieves infiltrated the bushes and trees waiting to ambush any traveler. It took a kind and courageous Samaritan to change that road from a haunted place to a holy place.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>As followers of Christ, we are capable of doing more than standing in holy places. We can make any place holy--not just our temples and chapels but also our homes, our workplaces, and our locker rooms. We have the ability, like the good Samaritan, to change the areas in which we stand from haunted places to holy places.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland illustrated how this can happen when he spoke of the experience of Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. If there were any place likely to be considered unholy or haunted, it would be that small jail, located near the western frontier of America, in the winter of 1838–39. As described by Elder Holland:<br><br><i>The jail . . . was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The . . . main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls . . . were . . . two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch . . . logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a . . . virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Joseph and his companions spent more than four months in that setting.<br><br>Elder Holland continued:<br><br><i>The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they "could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger." On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Joseph's letters, he spoke of the jail being a "hell, surrounded with demons . . . where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description."</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Elder Holland included further descriptions from Joseph Smith's letters:<br><br>"We have . . . not blankets sufficient to keep us warm; and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke."<sup>8</sup><br><br>"Our souls have been bowed down"<sup>9</sup> and "my nerve trembles from long confinement."<sup>10</sup><br><br>"Pen, or tongue, or angels [could not describe] the malice of hell that I have suffered."<sup>11</sup><br><br>That is not the kind of place that you or I would describe as holy. And yet it was in that setting that the Prophet received and recorded some of the most sublime revelations of this dispensation, including sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was so profound in that jail that B. H. Roberts, as Elder Holland noted, rightly referred to it as a "prison-temple."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Surely if such a place can become holy, then the places in which we find ourselves can similarly be altered. Once again, as Sister Larsen stated, "Holy places can be wherever you are--alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends." Or, as Elder Holland put it:<br><br><i>We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. . . . They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible.</i><br><br><i>But . . . when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in any situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in the most miserable experiences of your life--in the worst settings.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Haunted places truly can become holy places.<br><br>So what do we need to do to have the power to make such a change in the places in which we stand? The first thing is to recognize that we cannot do this alone. No matter how good we are, no matter how talented we are, no matter how influential we are, we do not have the ability to make such changes on our own. The sole source of such transformational power is God. If we are to make haunted places into holy places, we need to tap into His power.<br><br>How do we do that? Let me suggest a simple two-step process: We must first align ourselves with Him, and then we need to bind ourselves to Him. It is that simple. If we align ourselves with God and then bind ourselves to Him, we will be endowed with power to transform prisons into temples, humble dwellings into celestial abodes, and places of despair into havens of hope.<br><br>So how do we align ourselves with God? He has indicated that the best way to do that is to believe in and align ourselves with His Only Begotten Son. <sup>14</sup> We align ourselves with God by becoming true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ--by patterning our lives after His example. When we do that, we are changed in significant ways. As explained in the Church handbook:<br><br><i>As we become true followers of Jesus Christ, we experience a mighty change of heart and "have no more disposition to do evil." . . . As we live the gospel of Jesus Christ, we grow line upon line, becoming more like the Savior in loving and serving others.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Let me suggest two simple practices that can help us come into more complete alignment with the Savior: daily scripture study and daily prayer.<br><br>I know that these are not new suggestions. You have all heard them before, but I worry that in this regard we can--to use Alma's words to his son Helaman--become "slothful because of the easiness of the way."<sup>16</sup><br><br>When I was called as a bishop of a young single adult ward many years ago, our stake president was a wise, loving, and very seasoned priesthood leader. He had been a bishop, a stake president, and a mission president. He had seen it all. At one of our early training meetings he urged us to encourage our ward members to engage in daily scripture study and daily prayers. He said, "I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments."<br><br>I must confess that the first thought that came to my mind--sparked perhaps by the skepticism that legal training seems to inculcate in people--was, "Surely that can't be true. It is way too simple."<br><br>But I can assure you now, more than twenty-five years later, after having served as a bishop twice, as a stake president, and now as an Area Seventy, I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments. It really is that simple. The daily practice of serious study of the scriptures and sincere prayer keeps the Savior enough in our minds and the Spirit enough in our lives that we will either make the necessary corrections to stay in overall alignment with the Savior or we will stop studying and reading the scriptures and praying because it is too uncomfortable.<br><br>This does not mean you won't have challenges or questions. You will. But daily scripture study and daily prayer will keep you on the path--will keep you aligned with the Savior and our Father in Heaven--to such a degree that you will find, over time, you are a better person, one more able to not only stand in holy places but also make holy the places in which you stand.<br><br>But alignment with God in the abstract sense is not, by itself, sufficient to generate the power to transform our lives and the places we inhabit. We must not only align ourselves with God--we must also bind ourselves to Him. We need to draw upon God's power not only to meet the challenges we face but also to be transformed by them. And we do that by binding ourselves to Him. As Elder Holland explained, "<i>Every</i> experience can become a <i>redemptive</i> experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty."<sup>17</sup><br><br>And how do we bind ourselves to God? Through covenants. As Sister Linda K. Burton once noted, "Making and keeping covenants means choosing to bind ourselves to our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ."<sup>18</sup><br><br>Covenants are "sacred and enduring promise[s] between God and His children." <sup>19</sup> In the words of Elder D. Todd Christofferson, "In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments."<sup>20</sup><br><br>I think we sometimes underestimate the centrality of covenants in the gospel plan. It was only a few years ago I consciously recognized that the title of our scriptural collection of modern revelation focuses on covenants. We call those scriptures the Doctrine and Covenants. Maybe it would be more clear if we referred to it as the Doctrine and <i>the</i> Covenants, because those two things constitute the focus of revelation in this dispensation: the doctrine, meaning the principles of truth we need to understand, and the covenants, which lead us to employ and effectuate those truths in our lives.<br><br>Covenants are so powerful because it is through covenants that God's general promises are made operative in our individual lives. Elder Christofferson explained it this way:<br><br><i>Our covenants supply strength--they produce the faith necessary to persevere and to do all things that are expedient in the Lord. . . . In the first place, the promised fruits of obedience become evident, which confirms our faith. Secondly, the Spirit communicates God's pleasure, and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help. Thirdly, come what may, we can face life with hope and equanimity, knowing that we will succeed in the end because we have God's promise to us individually, by name, and we know He cannot lie.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>My advice to you in this regard is the same as that given by the Lord to Emma Smith in section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants: "Cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made."<sup>22</sup> <i>Cleave</i> does not mean to casually and lightly grasp. It means "to cling or hold fast to; to attach oneself." <sup>23</sup> The word <i>cleave</i> derives from the Old Norse word <i>klîfa,</i> which means "to . . . climb by clinging."<sup>24</sup> That is a pretty good visual image of how we can increase our potential for good. We climb upward by clinging, by hanging on with all our might to the covenants we have made with God, secure in His promise that He will keep His end of the agreement if we keep ours.<br><br>If we do align and bind ourselves with God, it will make a profound difference both to the quality of our lives and to the lives of others in ways we may not fully recognize. Let me illustrate by reference to the image of a lighthouse.<br><br>All of us are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins--a very important marker for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. Lighthouses are fixed and immovable. They are constant, and sailors can therefore rely on them.<br><br>But lighthouses also have another role to play for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. In addition to marking the place where the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the help of other lights, guide sailors through treacherous waters where there are reefs and other unseen barriers that might sink the ship. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor, and the only way the pilot knows the ship is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse aligns with the carefully placed light on the shore. Once the ship is in that position, it can proceed safely, as long as those lights--the one in the lighthouse and the one on the shore--are in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship is off course, and there is considerable risk of a tragic shipwreck.<br><br>In the October 2012 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer related an incident that explains this very well. On one occasion he was assigned to a stake conference in Western Samoa. As part of the conference the group had to travel from Savai'i to Mulifanua on Upolu Island. They had originally planned to go by plane, but weather conditions prevented that, so they set out on a forty-foot boat. What they did not know is that they were headed into the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Mulifanua. President Packer explained what happened next:<br><br><i>We arrived in the harbor at Mulifanua. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the two lights were one above the other, the boat would be lined up properly to pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage.</i><br><br><i>But that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower light. As a result, the passage through the reef was not clear.</i><br><br><i>The captain maneuvered the boat as best he could toward the one upper light on shore while a crewman held</i> [a] <i>flashlight over the bow, searching for rocks ahead. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we were close enough to see them with the flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage.</i><br><br><i>After many attempts, he knew it would be impossible to find the passage</i> [without the second light]. <i>All we could do was try to reach the harbor at Apia 40 miles (64 km) away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the elements.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>The group eventually made their way to safety, but it was a harrowing experience. President Packer observed, "I do not know who had been waiting for us at the beach at Mulifanua. . . . But it is true that without that lower light, we all might have been lost."<sup>26</sup><br><br>Let me share a similar story:<br><br><i>More than a hundred years ago, a well-known Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor on a very stormy night.</i><br><br><i>The ship's captain could see the bright light of the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the lower lights weren't visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor.</i><br><br><i>Because the lower lights were not burning that night, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost.</i><br><br><i>At the end of his sermon, Moody said, "Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights burning."</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>One of the members of Moody's congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moody's sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in our hymnbook is entitled "Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy." Many of you will be familiar with the hymn. All of you should be. With the image of the lighthouse and these experiences in mind, listen to the first verse of that hymn:<br><br><i>Brightly beams our Father's mercy</i><br><i>From his lighthouse evermore,</i><br><i>But to us he gives the keeping</i><br><i>Of the lights along the shore.</i><br><br><i>Let the lower lights be burning;</i><br><i>Send a gleam across the wave.</i><br><i>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman</i><br><i>You may rescue, you may save.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>The lighthouse of God's love for His children is ever present and never moving. Some people will see it and will be drawn to it, but they may not know how to get to it. They will be looking for someone--some lower light--to show them the safe passage to that light. Their feelings may be like those found in a letter President Monson received from a less-active member of the Church: "I know where the Church is, but sometimes I think I need someone else to show me the way, encourage me, take away my fear, and bear testimony to me."<sup>29</sup><br><br>There may be many around you in the places in which you stand who are in the same position. They want to do what is right, they want to have greater peace in their lives, and they want to come closer to God, but they are unsure of how to do it. Your example may provide the lower lights they need to see the safe passage. More may depend on your scripture study, prayer, and covenant keeping than just your well-being. Others may be affected by your doing these things as well.<br><br>Let me close with an example of how one whose light was burning bright affected others and turned what was a haunted place, at least for one person, into a holy place. It comes from an article written by Rick Reilly, who in my opinion is one of the best sportswriters of our time. It was written in the fall of 2012. Because he writes so well, I will quote extensively from his version of the story:<br><br><i>In the scrub-brush desert town of Queen Creek, Ariz., high school bullies were throwing trash at sophomore Chy Johnson. Calling her "stupid." Pushing her in the halls.</i> [Making it, I would say, a haunted place.]<br><br><i>Chy's brain works at only a third-grade level because of a genetic birth defect, but she knew enough to feel hate.</i><br><br><i> "She'd come home every night at the start of the school year crying and upset," says her mom, Liz Johnson. "That permanent smile she had, that gleam in her eye, that was all gone."</i><br><br><i>Her mom says she tried to talk to teachers and administrators and got nowhere. So she tried a whole new path--the starting quarterback of the undefeated football team. After all, senior Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics.</i><br><br><i> "Just keep your ear to the ground," Liz wrote to Carson on his Facebook page. "Maybe get me some names?"</i><br><br><i>But Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one in--Chy.</i><br><br><i>He started asking her to eat at the cool kids' lunch table with him and his teammates. "I just thought that if they saw her with us every day, maybe they'd start treating her better," Carson says. . . .</i><br><br><i>It got better. Starting running back Tucker Workman made sure somebody was walking between classes with Chy. In classes, cornerback Colton Moore made sure she sat in the row right behind the team.</i><br><br>Just step back a second. In some schools, it's the football players doing the bullying. At Queen Creek, they're stopping it. And not with fists--with straight-up love for a kid most teenage football players wouldn't even notice, much less hang out with. . . .<br><br><i>It's working.</i><br><br><i> "I was parking my car yesterday, and I saw a couple of the guys talking to her and being nice," says offensive lineman Bryce Oakes. "I think it's making a difference around here."</i><br><br>And the best thing is? The football players didn't tell anybody.<br><br><i> "I didn't know about any of this until three weeks ago," says Carson's mom, Rondalee, who's raising four boys and a daughter by herself. "He finally showed me an article they wrote here locally. I said, 'Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me this?'"</i><br><br><i>All of a sudden, Chy started coming home as her bubbly self again. When her mom asked why she was so happy, she said, "I'm eating lunch with my boys!" . . .</i><br><br><i>I get emailed stories like this a lot, but most of the time they don't pan out. They turn out to be half true, or true for the first week but not the second. But when I walked into the Queen Creek High School cafeteria Tuesday, unannounced, there was 4-foot-high Chy with 11 senior football players, eating her lunch around the most packed lunch table you've ever seen, grinning like it was Christmas morning. . . .</i><br><br><i> "I thank Carson every chance I see him," says Chy's mom. "He's an amazing young man. He's going to go far in life."</i><br><br><i>Nobody knows how far Chy Johnson will go in life. The life expectancy of those afflicted with her disease, microcephaly, is only 25–30 years. But her sophomore year, so far, has been unforgettable.</i> [I might say it has been turned from a haunted place into a holy place.] . . .<br><br><i>But what about next year, when Carson probably will be on his Mormon mission and all of Chy's boys will have graduated?</i><br><br><i>Not to worry. Carson has a little brother on the team, Curtis, who's in Chy's class.</i><br><br><i> "Mom," he announced at the dinner table the other night, "I got this."</i><br><br><i>Lucky girl.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>One person setting an example for others--who probably wanted to help but didn't know how--and, all of a sudden, a haunted place became a holy place. If you make and keep sacred covenants, if you prepare yourself daily for spiritual experiences through scripture study and prayer, if you align and bind yourselves with God, a light will emanate from you. Others will be drawn to that light, which is just a reflection of God's light, and they will be drawn to Him. As that happens, you will not only be able to stand in holy places but you will also make the places in which you stand holy for you and for others.<br><br>I bear you my witness that God lives. He has a perfect plan for each one of us. He places us where we can help others. That plan includes the birth, Atonement, death, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, who leads this work today. I bear you my witness of these elements of the plan and of the truths that have been restored through Joseph Smith, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given at BYU–Hawaii on 20 January 2015.</i><br><br><strong>Notes</strong><br><br>1.

<h1>dant Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor to be asked to speak at this devotional. Our family has a real loyalty to Brigham Young University. My husband and I, our five children, and their spouses all graduated from BYU. As our grandchildren approach their college years, we hope they will carry on the BYU tradition.<br><br>As I thought about speaking here today, I reflected back on the days when I attended BYU--a half century ago. That makes me sound so old!<br><br>I came to BYU from a small high school; there were fewer than sixty of us in our graduating class. I hadn't traveled much. Living on a farm meant there was always work to be done, cows to milk, and water to change, so we didn't get far from home. Coming to BYU was quite an exciting adventure for me. I admit I came a little starry-eyed, with my head full of dreams, as I looked forward to more independence, new friends, and new opportunities to prepare for my future. That is probably why I was a little disappointed when the first boy to ask me out on a date was from my high school. He was also the second one to ask me out--and the third and the fourth.<br><br>I became concerned that this hometown boy would begin thinking there was more to our relationship than I thought there was, and I determined that I needed to talk to him about it. One night as he took me home from a date, I looked for just the right opportunity.<br><br>As he took me to the door, and before I could say anything, he said, "I was just wondering if you would like to go steady with me."<br><br>It had happened just as I was afraid it would, and I quickly responded, "Oh, no, I can't do that. I didn't come here to BYU to do that. I came here to date lots of guys, have fun, and meet lots of people."<br><br>As I went on and on, his eyes got wide, and, finally, when I paused to take a breath, he asked, "What did you think I just asked you?"<br><br>A little puzzled, I responded, "You asked me if I would like to go steady with you."<br><br>He shook his head and said, "No, I asked if you would like to go study with me--s-t-u-d-y. Study."<br><br>Needless to say, he never asked me out again!<br><br>I offer this advice: If anyone asks you to go study or to go steady, ask them to spell it.<br><br>As I was reading in the book of John recently, I paused to ponder the Savior's words when He said, "I am come that they [meaning you and me] might have life, and that they [you and me] might have it more abundantly."<sup>1</sup> Everything the Savior did and said was for the benefit of humankind. His Atonement, His example, and His teachings--everything was to help us not only to have a more abundant life on earth but also to attain the most abundant of all life--even eternal life.<br><br>Today I would like to emphasize three principles the Savior taught that will lead us to live a more abundant life.<br><br>One foundational principle is seeking light and truth. The Savior blesses those who "are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth."<sup>2</sup><br><br>President James E. Faust said, "Opportunities for the abundant life increase as we pursue the quest for truth and knowledge."<sup>3</sup><br><br>President David O. McKay, a great proponent of learning and education, said it this way: "To feel one's faculties unfolding and truth expanding the soul is one of life's sublimest experiences."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Patricia Farr, a graduate of BYU, described such an experience in a letter to Elder Merrill J. Bateman when he was serving as president of this university. Patricia told of sitting in a physics class in which they<br><br><i>were discussing fiber optics and how light travels perfectly through strands of plastic without losing energy. I realized as the lecture proceeded that all things point to Christ. Christ has all power and never "loses energy" as He influences our lives. I sat in awe at the understanding that came to me; not a physical understanding but a spiritual enlightenment filled my soul. I came out of that lecture on a spiritual high.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>I don't believe that experiences like Patricia's are uncommon here at BYU.<br><br>In his inaugural address, President Kevin J Worthen reaffirmed the mission of Brigham Young University:<br><br><i>We are "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" by providing "a period of intensive learning" that includes not just "the arts, letters, and sciences" but also "the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>What a blessed opportunity it is to attend a university where one can learn both secular and spiritual truths simultaneously and not one at the expense of the other. In speaking about the uniqueness that underlies BYU, President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>This university shares with other universities the hope and the labor involved in rolling back the frontiers of knowledge, but we also know that, through divine revelation, there are yet "many great and important things" to be given to mankind which will have an intellectual and spiritual impact far beyond what mere men can imagine. Thus, at this university among faculty, students, and administration, there is, and there must be, an excitement and an expectation about the very nature and future of knowledge.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>The search for knowledge, light, and truth is one of the reasons we are on earth. It is a lifelong pursuit that requires great effort and diligence on our part, whether by study or by faith.<br><br>Keith W. Wilcox, a member of the Church and a prominent architect, shared an experience from his university years that illustrates this truth. As part of his thesis while completing his master of architecture degree at the University of Oregon, his professor asked him to find one word or phrase that described the spirit of his church and then to design a church building that would demonstrate that word or phrase.<br><br>Keith responded to his professor that he<br><br><i>felt a single word or phrase could not be found to describe the spirit of my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since it is based upon all truth and therefore embraces all true, revealed religious beliefs and practices. </i><br><br><i>The professor disagreed. He felt strongly that what was missing from my thesis was a simple description of the spirit of my church and a design that would express it architecturally. </i><br><br><i>After the meeting, I left facing a challenge that, if not met, could well keep me from entering my chosen professional field. After pondering this dilemma, I decided to interview my priesthood leaders and other Church members in our ward. Many excellent suggestions for a single word or phrase to describe the spirit of the Church were made, including faith, eternal progression, revelation, the Book of Mormon, priesthood, prophets and apostles, and many others. I considered them all. But a means of satisfactorily expressing any of these gospel principles architecturally did not come to me. </i><br><br><i>With this delay in getting my degree, pressure mounted while I wrestled with the problem. For one thing, living costs for my family were becoming a concern. Then one night while pondering my problem, I realized I had not taken the challenge directly to our Father in Heaven. I had prayed for guidance and had sought out my priesthood leaders for advice, but I had not asked the Lord specifically for help in finding the word or phrase I needed. Humility filled my entire being. I had done all in my power to find an answer but had not been able to find a solution on my own. I truly needed direct help. </i><br><br><i>I found a quiet, private place to pray, and there I knelt and poured out my heart to my Heavenly Father. As I concluded my prayer, a word flashed into my mind: </i>enlightenment. <i>Then the phrase </i>light and enlightenment <i>followed. Joy swept through me. My prayer had been answered. I thought of how light and truth have been restored in our day through the Prophet Joseph Smith. As prophets, seers, and revelators, our Church leaders continue to offer light and truth to all who will listen. Our missionary efforts truly bring enlightenment to the world. Our temples glow with spiritual light. Eternal truths are taught and enlighten all who enter therein. </i><br><br><i>Suddenly it was easy to envision a meaningful architectural design for one of our Church buildings. I decided to design a building that would allow light to penetrate from the heavens all day long and that would radiate light heavenward each evening. </i><br><br><i>The resubmission of my thesis that now illustrated the phrase </i>light and enlightenment <i>was accepted. My professors expressed great interest in both the history and my description of the spirit of our church. </i><br><br><i>I am grateful to our Father in Heaven for the insight and inspiration I received on that occasion. The deep meaning and spiritual significance of this experience have been a wonderful and continued blessing to me since that day.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Keith "went on to design many significant buildings and was part of the design team for the Washington DC Temple and the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah."<sup>9</sup><br><br>In his recent general conference talk about receiving a testimony of light and truth, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>The Everlasting and Almighty God . . . will speak to those who approach Him with a sincere heart and real intent. </i><br><br><i>He will speak to them in dreams, visions, thoughts, and feelings. </i><br><br><i>He will speak in a way that is unmistakable and that transcends human experience. He will give them divine direction and answers for their personal lives. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . God cares about you. He will listen, and He will answer your personal questions. The answers to your prayers will come in His own way and in His own time, and therefore, you need to learn to listen to His voice.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>A second principle of living the abundant life is revealed in Isaiah's words: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin echoed this thought when he said:<br><br><i>Our search for the abundant life is cloaked not only in the robes of this mortal clay; its true end can only be comprehended from the perspective of the eternities that stretch infinitely before us.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Elder Wirthlin taught us that an eternal perspective is important in our quest for the abundant life.<br><br>In this journey of life, it is important for us to understand God's plan. Change, challenges, trials, and temptations are temporary and prepare us for eternal life.<br><br>In a speech Elder James A. Cullimore gave at BYU, he related an experience once told by religious writer Harleigh M. Rosenberger:<br><br><i>Several years ago a man was being interviewed on the radio. He had started to walk across the United States on foot, from California to New York. He had reached a point halfway across. Reporters asked him about his experience. Finally the question came: "Sir, what would you say has been your most difficult experience so far?" </i><br><br><i>The traveler thought long. Through his mind went the toilsome climb over mountain passes; hot dry stretches of desert. Sun. Wind. Then he said quietly, "I guess my greatest problem was <b>that the sand kept getting into my shoes.</b>" </i><br><br><i>So that was it. The sand in his shoes. Not some great crisis that he had faced. Not some danger that had almost taken his life. But sand; sand that wore blisters on the soles of his feet. Sand that ground its way into the pores of his skin and irritated constantly, that made every step an agony. Sand in his shoes. . . . </i><br><br><i>. . . Now there was one hint that the hiker suggested when the sand got into his shoes. He had to stop and dump the sand from them.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>In our journey in life we too are troubled with sand in our shoes--sand in the form of change, challenges, trials, and temptations. We can either let these things stop us short of our goal or we can find ways to dump the sand from our shoes and continue our journey.<br><br>My husband, Max, and I were married in the fall, and the next spring we both graduated from BYU. During this time the military draft was in force, and Max had received a letter indicating that he would be drafted into military service upon graduation. During Max's two years in the service I taught school near my hometown so that I could be near my family. After his service, Max worked with his family ranching operation for a year. Then we decided he should come back to BYU to get more education. Finances were tight, and I was expecting our first baby, but we were able to find a tiny basement apartment that fit our budget, and he started school. Shortly after, Max was called to be the Young Men president. He was a little concerned because his studies were rigorous and took a lot of time, but he accepted the calling.<br><br>One day my husband came home quite devastated. He had received a C on his first test in a class that was critical to his major. He had studied hard, and he began to doubt his ability to compete in that major. His shoes were filling with the sand of discouragement and doubt. For several days he couldn't eat or sleep as he worried about what to do. He considered giving up and going back to life on the ranch to do what he knew best and what he was comfortable with. After a lot of prayer and soul-searching, he decided to continue with his education, and he graduated with honors.<br><br>In hindsight, the C on a test was such a little thing, but often it is the little things--the little grains of sand--that distract us and keep us from seeing with an eternal perspective. I will always be grateful that my husband was willing to dump the sand from his shoes and move on. Because he was willing to pay the price and move beyond his comfort zone, many doors of opportunity were opened to him. Throughout his life he has used his skills and knowledge not only to bless our family but many others as well.<br><br>Each new day brings with it the opportunity to evaluate where we are in terms of where we are going. Wherever we are on our journey, the Savior has made it possible, through His redeeming and enabling power, for us to dump the sand from our shoes. It is up to us to apply these powers in our life and to continue our journey strengthened with hope and faith. Heavenly Father and our Savior want you to succeed. President Thomas S. Monson expressed his confidence in your ability to do so when he said: "This is your world. The future is in your hands. The outcome is up to you."<sup>14</sup><br><br>A third principle of living an abundant life is feeling and expressing gratitude. The Lord promised:<br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>In this year's January <i>Ensign, </i>a young woman named Elizabeth Stitt shared an experience she had learning about the power of gratitude. Her story was inspiring to me not only because I know Elizabeth personally but because it was a message I needed as well.<br><br>Elizabeth shared her story:<br><br><i>Several months after returning home from a mission, I had the opportunity to go back to the city where I served to do a research project to finish my undergraduate degree. As I traveled each day throughout the city to do my project, Heavenly Father blessed me in many ways. He guided my path and protected me. He gave me opportunities to share the gospel, and He multiplied my time so I could do my project and also visit many of the people I taught, knew, and loved as a full-time missionary. </i><br><br><i>I felt so blessed that every morning and night I poured out my soul in gratitude to my Father for the chance to be there. Throughout the day I prayed in my heart, thanking Him when my plans went smoothly. And when they didn't go smoothly, I thanked Him for the plan He had for me instead, which usually ended up being a better one anyway. </i><br><br><i>One day on the trip, I sat pondering my experiences. I wondered why Heavenly Father was helping me so much. The thought came clearly to my mind: "It is because you are being grateful." That day I learned that sometimes gratitude precedes the blessing. The more grateful I was, the more I could recognize the blessings I received and appreciate the lessons I learned from difficulties. And the more I recognized the blessings and lessons, the more I had to be grateful for.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>It is interesting how gratitude works. We think we are giving back to the Lord by being grateful, but instead the Lord blesses us still more--for being grateful.<br><br>We are so greatly blessed, and most of us have done very little to merit the many blessings given us. Every time I read in Deuteronomy 6 and 7, I reflect on how indebted I am to the Lord and to all those who have gone before and have sacrificed so much. After forty years in the wilderness, the Israelites came to a mountaintop overlooking the land of promise. As Moses prepared them to enter this land without him, he spoke to them as a dying father speaks to his children. He told them what awaited them:<br><br><i>The Lord thy God shall </i>[bring] <i>thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers . . . to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not, </i><br><br><i>And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; </i><br><br><i>Then beware lest thou forget the Lord.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>This is every bit as much a message to modern-day Israel--you and me. Too often when we inherit or get things that others have worked and sacrificed so hard for, we don't appreciate them. Occasionally we are not as grateful. We might even feel entitled, expecting things to just be handed to us for the taking. Joseph Smith and the early Saints gave up all they had, sometimes several times, as they were driven from place to place for the gospel. Many sacrificed their very lives. We need to be grateful not only for those who went before and sacrificed so much but especially to be grateful to God from whom comes every good thing.<br><br>Now is our time to contribute--our time to build, our time to dig, and our time to plant.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley explained the importance of each of our contributions:<br><br><i>We must ever keep before us the big picture, while not neglecting the details. That large picture is a portrayal of the whole broad mission of the Church; but it is painted one brush stroke at a time through the lives of all members. . . . </i><br><br><i>Each of us, therefore, is important. Each is a brush stroke, as it were, on the mural of this vast panorama of the kingdom of God.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>We have talked about having the abundant life through seeking light, truth, and knowledge; through looking through the lens of an eternal perspective; and through feeling and expressing gratitude. The abundant life can be ours as we take advantage of these and so many other opportunities that are available to us in this day.<br><br>I end with where I started. May we always remember that our Savior came that we "might have life, and that [we] might have it more abundantly."<sup>19</sup> I testify that He is the One who makes the abundant life possible. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl A.

<h1>lent: Becoming Who You Are in Today&#039;s World - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There is an ancient temple in Greece, in some foothills near the ocean, that is dedicated to the Greek god Apollo. Above the entrance of this temple, now referred to as the Oracle at Delphi, is the following well-known inscription: "Know thyself." This simple yet profound invitation reflects an important step in our progression as human beings.<br><br>Like many societies, the Greeks were concerned with existential questions, such as what it means to be human. Some of the best thinking on this subject is captured in what I argue is one of the more significant non-scriptural books in Western literature. The philosopher Aristotle addressed these kinds of issues in an unfortunately titled book, <i>The Nicomachean Ethics.</i> In it he asks the question, What does it mean to be fully human? Or, as he puts it, What is the highest human good? Aristotle spent the first part of the book dismissing what the world tells us is important, such as wealth and pleasure. His conclusion? Our most fully human aspiration is personal excellence, or, in his words, "activity of soul exhibiting excellence."<sup>1</sup><br><br>The Greek term for excellence, <i>arête,</i> is interesting. <i>Arête</i> is the act of living up to one's potential, whether it is applied to a building, an animal, or a human. The Greeks believed that all humans are born with innate potential and that the purpose of life is to figure out what that potential is and to then act on it.<br><br>This mind-set is reflected in psychology as well. Many of you may be familiar with Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of needs. While parts of his theory are problematic, he argues that the highest human need is self-actualization. According to Maslow, self-actualization is the need to realize our potential and our creative abilities and basically to be the best person we are capable of becoming. In short, we need to be all that we can be.<br><br>You are probably starting to see where I am going with this. We are born with unique potential that we need to fulfill during our lives. The philosopher Charles Taylor emphasized this distinct and individual need:<br><br><i>There is a certain way of being human that is <b>my</b> way. I am called upon to live my life in this way, and not in imitation of anyone else's life. But this notion gives a new importance to being true to myself. If I am not, . . . I miss what being human is for <b>me.</b></i><sup>2</sup><br><br>You have been blessed with skills, abilities, and gifts that are unique to you, and you alone. Furthermore, you have an obligation to find out what those are and then to figure out how you can express them--in other words, how to imprint your uniqueness of self on the world.<br><br>A variety of philosophers, psychologists, and writers, among others, tell us what has already been revealed through the gospel of Jesus Christ: that our main purpose here on earth is to become--to become our best, but, more important, to become perfect, even like our Father in Heaven is perfect. This challenge is simple yet complex. We have to have a body. We need to keep the commandments. We need to fulfill certain ordinances. But along with these amazing opportunities, we also have an obligation to take full advantage of our experience here on earth.<br><br>What are your unique gifts? Are you fully developing them? Are you being all you can be? What does that even mean? Am I trying to put even more pressure on you to succeed in a world in which you are under unprecedented amounts of stress? The answer is no and yes. No, I am not trying to stress you out even more. To the contrary, my goal is to provide some direction so that you can find your singular way through the world. But yes, I do want to encourage you to be true to yourself--to your God-given potential--and to be excellent.<br><h2><b>Being Excellent</b></h2><br>But what did Aristotle mean by "activity of soul exhibiting excellence"? What does it mean to be all you can be? Let me provide an example. Aaron Shamy is a student in our Executive MPA program. Fifteen years ago he was one of the premiere speed climbers in the world. Speed climbers compete by scaling climbing walls as quickly as possible. It is a demanding sport, and to be the best you must be an elite athlete. It takes a tremendous amount of talent, effort, and time to be a world champion at just about anything. At age eighteen Aaron was an X Games gold medalist, but he was also self-actualizing. These periods of self-fulfillment and personal excellence can be transformational. As Aaron said, "It was just complete exhilaration, and I was hooked from day one. . . . Rock climbing became such a foundation, a base of who I am as a person."3 Aaron is one of the lucky ones who found his niche in which he was allowed to grow, be challenged, and realize his potential. But sports is an easy example. Personal excellence can be found in many areas of our lives.<br><br>For example, until recently I was the director of the MPA program on campus. I was consistently struck by how many of our students and alumni were drawn to the program by a deeply intrinsic pull. A common story often conveyed is that someone heard about the MPA program through a poster, a friend, or a relative, and once they learned more, "angels started singing," meaning the idea of public service resonated on a profoundly personal level.<br><br>For certain people, careers in the public and nonprofit service will allow them to fulfill their professional potential. But the MPA is clearly not meant for everybody, just like speed climbing or being a concert violinist are not. That is part of the beauty of our Heavenly Father's plan. We are all unique beings. But we all need to find a way to imprint our uniqueness on the world around us in some way.<br><br>Many of you are at a point in your lives in which these questions are particularly salient. I hope you all recognize the sacredness of your decisions. Many of you are not only deciding what you will be spending most of your waking hours doing but also how you will do what you decide to do. It is likely an exciting and anxiety-inducing time. While some of you will be blessed with having your calling in life laid out clearly before you, others will not. If not, your challenge is to discover the gifts that are distinctly yours and find ways to give expression to them. So, while I strongly encourage all of you to seek fulfilling career options, I also strongly encourage you to remember that there are multiple and sometimes subtle ways to fulfill your potential as one of Heavenly Father's children. This can happen in your job, in a church calling, while raising a family, while volunteering in your community, or even while doing something as unusual as freestyle canoeing. A key message to take away from today's devotional is this: personal excellence is not about being <i>the</i> best but about being <i>your</i> best at <i>whatever</i> you choose to do.<br><br>And why are you obligated to be the best you can be? Philosophers would tell us that to be our best is the ultimate purpose of our existence--the highest human good. Psychologists would tell us that not fulfilling the highest human needs creates any number of forms of alienation, all of which are unhealthy. Sports coaches tell us that potential just means we haven't done anything yet. And finally, the gospel tells us that we are here to develop and become like our Father in Heaven. Furthermore, the scriptures state that "unto whom much is given much is required"4--and we all have been given much. All of these perspectives lead to the conclusion that in order to be healthy and happy in this life and in the next, we need to fully develop ourselves.<br><h2><b>Pursuing Your Excellence: Becoming Who You Are</b></h2><br>Finding and pursuing your unique excellence is an introspective and reflective process that should be guided by the Spirit. It is not a free ticket to be irresponsible and selfish. The world would have us believe that "finding yourself" is a self-centered journey without consequence. You do not want to rely on what the world tells you that you should do with your life--your potential is yours alone, and it is your sacred obligation to figure out what that is and to pursue it. While there is no blueprint for success in finding and fulfilling your potential, the first step is to "know thyself." I would like to offer five suggestions that may help you on your way. I start with practical advice and progress to gospel-centered principles that can provide personal insight and put you in a position to find your excellence and also to take full advantage of life's opportunities.<br><h3><i><b>1. Engage</b></i></h3><br>First, the practical advice: be engaged. The short answer to being engaged is giving your whole and best self to whatever you are doing. This may sound similar to the tired cliché of giving 100 percent in whatever you do, but it is more substantial than that. Let me explain. The first step to being engaged is to be fully present in whatever demands your attention. Give your total effort and attention to whatever you are doing. Even if it is a dumb homework assignment, a boring conversation with a friend, or a mind-numbing job, it is in your interest to be fully engaged and to give your best effort. Why? Because it is great practice. Being engaged puts you in tune with yourself. The less engaged you are in life, the less in touch you will be with your potential. Being engaged will teach you a lot about yourself, your interests, and where you can pursue your excellence.<br><br>While you anxiously engage in whatever you are doing, I also encourage you to seek out opportunities for deeper, more meaningful levels of engagement. The ideal form of engagement is a state of total immersion in a task that is challenging yet closely matched to your abilities. When this happens, we often lose self-consciousness. In sports it is called being "in the zone," while some social scientists call it "flow"5 because it often feels like effortless movement. This can happen with physical activities, creative activities, spiritual activities, or even meaningful interactions with others. I often find this state of immersion when I am deep in my work doing research or while teaching on a particularly good day of class, preparing for devotionals, serving others, or even skiing. Remember, however, that the most meaningful, fully human activities almost always involve betterment--making the people and environment around us better in some way.<br><br>Experiencing what some call "flow" is critical in discovering your excellence because it is during these moments that you are likely tapping into your distinct talents and abilities. As you become aware of these moments, start searching for patterns and matching them up with a humble and accurate assessment of yourself and the practical possibilities they present. It will help you along the path toward finding additional opportunities for personal growth and flow and ultimately fulfilling your potential.<br><h3><i><b>2. Seek Absence</b></i></h3><br>My second suggestion for discovering your personal excellence is to increase your self-awareness. In short, you have to know who you are before you can figure out what you are going to do with yourself. Unfortunately, you face some challenging obstacles in this process.<br><br>We live in a world of unprecedented distraction. With the advent of technology and the explosion of media in its wake, we live in an extraordinary time when we have nearly unlimited access to information, entertainment, and other people. It is truly a blessing. But it can also be a curse. As the author Michael Harris recently wrote:<br><br><i>As we embrace a technology's gifts, we usually fail to consider what they ask from us in return--the subtle, hardly noticeable payments we make in exchange for their marvelous service.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>So what exactly are we giving up when we submerge ourselves into our phones or other devices? What are we being drawn away from? This author argues that we give up absence or lack. As he put it, "The daydreaming silences in our lives are filled; the burning solitudes are extinguished."7 We are giving up those vital empty moments when we often and unintentionally learn about ourselves and receive spiritual promptings and other insights that only come in the space of absence from the noise in our lives. A final comment from Harris explains why this is so troublesome:<br><br><i>We need . . . absences in order to think and see for ourselves. Indeed, the kinds of thoughts that present themselves in our emptiest moments--the moments when we stare out the train's windows or hover on a lawn to monitor the sky--are the only thoughts that can deliver a strange new understanding.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>This strange new understanding as it relates to finding and fulfilling our potential regards insights of self-awareness for a better understanding of who we are as individuals.<br><br>My suggestion to you is to build absence into your lives. Set aside time to unplug, remove distractions, and let your mind wander. As an avid consumer of technology, this has been understandably challenging for me. I am a runner and have always listened to music to help pass the time. A year or so ago I decided to run every other time without music. It was an embarrassingly painful process, but it has been surprisingly liberating. Some of my best insights about myself and my work as well as personal revelation have come while I was running and not thinking about anything in particular. I urge you to follow the advice of Marcus Aurelius: "Allow yourself a space of quiet, wherein you can add to your knowledge of the Good and learn to curb your restlessness."9 Build spaces of quiet into your lives and be patient, and I think you will be surprised by the results.<br><h3><i><b>3. Be Awe-Full</b></i></h3><br>My third suggestion to you is to be awe-full. Or, put another way, be full of awe. Make a conscious effort to find awe and wonder in the small and ordinary things of everyday life. As an example from an unimportant aspect of life, I love running in the mountains because I find so much awe in the beauty of nature. While it is easy to be blown away by a beautiful overlook, I find equal wonder in a sweet stretch of single track, the bend of a creek, or the sound of my feet crunching on a rocky trail. As a professor, it is just as easy to find awe in the contributions of students in a great class discussion or in a particularly good passage of writing. My favorite awe, however, is watching my boys grow up and become strong in the gospel.<br><br>Along these lines, I would further submit that you find awe in the spiritual side of what you do. Earnestly seek to see and appreciate the Lord's hand in your life, because it is everywhere around you. It is easy to see the Lord's handiwork in nature, but I encourage you to search for the same kind of awe in all of the Lord's creations, whether that be in the people you interact with at school or work or even in the more menial tasks that we do every day. All of us are tremendously blessed in ways we may not fully realize, and we all benefit even more when we recognize the Lord's influence in our lives.<br><br>The point is that in today's world it is tougher and tougher to be awed by ordinary things. Make an extra effort to find awe in the everyday aspects of your life and take a moment to say, "Wow!" In so doing, your senses will be heightened and, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as additional opportunities to apply your uniqueness.<br><h3><i><b>4. Be Selfless</b></i></h3><br>My fourth suggestion to you on your quest to knowing yourself and your unique excellence is to be selfless. As I mentioned earlier, the world would have us think that finding who you are in this life is an intensely selfish journey in which your personal happiness trumps everything. The irony of this attitude is that it is just the opposite that not only leads to personal happiness but also reveals a lot about who we are as individuals.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ is completely grounded in selflessness. The Atonement of our Savior was the ultimate act of selflessness. The Lord voluntarily took upon Himself the sins of the world so that we can return to the presence of our Heavenly Father. The basic principles of the Church on the earth today are also grounded in selflessness. Some of those principles include preaching the gospel, building up our fellow Saints, participating in temple work, and caring for the needy. All of these at their very base require selflessness on our part. And we all know that when we do these things we are happiest and at our best.<br><br>An example from a recent prophet illustrates this point. Several years ago the Church produced a documentary on the prophet Gordon B. Hinckley. One part focused on his time as a missionary. President Hinckley described how, like many of us, he struggled with homesickness and his effectiveness as a missionary. He sent a letter home in which he shared his doubts and discouragement. His father sent a brief letter in return that said, "I have only one suggestion: forget yourself and go to work."<br><br>The next day in scripture study Elder Hinckley happened to read a powerful message:<br><br><i>He said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>It may seem counterintuitive to some that you find yourself when you lose yourself. While these verses are laden with meaning, the relevance here is twofold. First, forget yourself and go to work. Throw yourself into whatever you are doing. The less time we spend "pacing up and down within the cell of our circumstance,"11 the more likely it is that we will find meaning in what we are doing. President Hinckley blossomed as a missionary shortly after committing to lose himself in the work. In fact, he stated that this was a life-changing moment.<br><br>Second, selflessness keeps us grounded as we seek to find and exercise our personal excellence. If one were to get too caught up in finding his or her potential, it could be easy to become self-absorbed and put important relationships in jeopardy. Returning to the speed climber Aaron Shamy, he stated that one of the reasons he left competitive climbing was because he saw that to continue to be the best, he would risk sacrificing family relationships and other critical priorities.12 The Lord challenges us to lose ourselves so that we can have the attitudes that will keep us grounded, humble, and open to learning. In losing ourselves, we learn about ourselves--and that insight provides invaluable perspective in finding our excellence.<br><h3><i><b>5. Be Compassionate</b></i></h3><br>My final suggestion is to be compassionate. Several years ago my wife, Lisa, and I attended a regional conference in which Elder Robert D. Hales spoke. He spent an hour talking about a single scripture in the book of Jude: "And of some have compassion, making a difference."13 He noted that there are two essential parts to compassion: feeling and doing. These are both very relevant to the topic at hand.<br><br>Feeling is the capacity to feel what others feel. This is also known as empathy. The economist Adam Smith gave a great definition of empathy: "The person . . . must . . . endeavour, as much as he can, to put himself in the situation of the other, and to bring home to himself every little circumstance of distress which can possibly occur to the sufferer."14 This is perhaps best demonstrated through the most compassionate person during the most compassionate act. One of the key actions of the Atonement was Christ's suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane. It was there that He suffered through every feeling in every situation. Because of that, Christ is truly the most compassionate being because He can actually relate to every possible circumstance we encounter. By extension, a critical part of our development is learning to have empathy--to feel.<br><br>But true compassion does not stop there. Doing means actually acting on those feelings. Not coincidentally, the best model is again our Savior. A classic but common example is found in John, when Christ raised Lazarus from the dead. He came to the grieving family, and when He saw their grief, "he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled."15 He also wept with the family. He was feeling. And then He acted: He asked to be taken to Lazarus, and, with great faith, He raised him from the dead.<br><br>There are myriad examples like this in the scriptures. Being dialed into your feelings of empathy and acting on them is also necessary to find your excellence. Compassion is an indispensable part of personal growth that will reveal much about your distinct set of skills and what types of situations will allow you to better the people and environment around you.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, recognize that as a child of your Father in Heaven, you have been given a unique set of talents, abilities, and gifts and that you have an obligation to develop them so that you can bless the lives of those around you. For most of us, however, finding our excellence and acting on it doesn't just happen--it needs to be a thoughtful, systematic process. If you follow the suggestions I have offered and combine them with earnest prayer and pondering, they can provide you with the insight needed to see where and possibly how you can maximize your potential and leave your indelible mark in the world.<br><br>If you don't "know thyself" and act on it, you will not be taking advantage of those sacred gifts. A philosopher said, "Hell is when the man that is comes face to face with the man that might have been." I think all of us would like to avoid that realization. So engage life, create time for absence, find reasons to say "Wow!" and selflessly serve others with love and compassion and you will learn a lot about yourself and the gifts that have been bestowed upon you.<br><br>Finally, remember the words of superhero philosopher Peter Parker in the first <i>Spider-Man</i> movie, that "with great power comes great responsibility." What is that responsibility? It is not just to act but to find out what is uniquely yours and give expression to it. Spend your time here at BYU learning about who you really are and preparing yourselves to have an impact on the world. Then go and do. Be excellent and make a difference.<br><br>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David W.

<br>
I have to tell you how much I love working and living in a college town, where I get to know so many wonderful students. When our youngest, Rob, was about five, we were out shopping, and I bumped into a bunch of students, as frequently happens. It was great because he looked up at me kind of wide-eyed and said, "Mom, every place we go people know you. Are you famous?"<br><br>Of course I said, "Yes."<br><br>I may not be famous, but I am blessed to work with so many fantastic colleagues and friends and to have so many great students; they inspire me in many ways. Many of my students are here today. My Chemistry 285 class actually meets every day at noon, so today they get a short, one-day reprieve from amino acids and proteins, but they should be suspicious that I am going to work in something from today's devotional in tomorrow's quiz. So pay attention.<br><br>As a brand-new chemistry graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, my faculty advisor, Dr. Charlie Perrin, gave me the relatively easy task of replicating the experiments of a student who was leaving our lab. The results from that project were going to be published in the <i>Journal of the American Chemical Society,</i> which is a top journal in my field.<br><br>When I finished the experiments, my results were the opposite of the original findings. I repeated the experiments several times, but each time the results didn't match. I began to panic. My failure to replicate felt like evidence that I was terrible in the lab. I took my results to my advisor, and he was surprised. He suggested a series of modified molecules on which I could repeat similar experiments.<br><br>I worked hard. I purified materials. I read literature techniques. I did a mountain of experiments. I talked about ideas with my favorite friend in chemistry, Julie, and at the end of a long day I would come home and worry out loud to my husband, Dan. In the end, what we learned is that the original results were inaccurate. Eventually we published a paper in the same journal, retracting the first claims and proposing a new conclusion. In fact, the title changed from the original "Symmetries of Hydrogen Bonds" to "Asymmetry of Hydrogen Bonds."<br><br>Charlie Perrin became one of my heroes. He valued learning truth over protecting his reputation. Every time I entered his office with new ideas or new results, he welcomed them. He felt that even an unexpected or "wrong" result taught us something.<br><br>I learned so much from this experience--including that ice cream soothes my soul after a long day--that has shaped me over the years. I learned that experiments help us gain truth, that we can become stronger from struggles, that meaningful results require a lot of time and effort, and that working with others is essential. I believe that life experiences, which we might also call experiments, are <i>meant</i> to enable us to grow and become Christlike.<br><h2><b>Gain Truth</b></h2><br>Theory is not enough. Experimenting is where theory meets reality. Doctrine remains theory in our minds until we show our belief in the doctrine by acting. Amulek taught this principle to the poor among the Zoramites in Alma 34:<br><br><i>Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the <b>experiment</b> of its goodness.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>The word they should plant is the doctrine of the Atonement:<br><br><i>I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>The experiment Alma exhorts them to try is found in verses 17–29: to exercise faith unto repentance, to pray always and everywhere, to take care of the needy and the naked, to visit the sick and afflicted, and to share their substance.<br><br>Experiments can also teach us whether a theory explains reality or needs to be revised or discarded. When our son Rob graduated from diapers at age two, he got his first pair of briefs, emblazoned with the Spiderman logo. Excited, he asked, "Does this mean I can climb up walls now?" He tested his theory, and he learned he could not climb walls, but he confirmed a number of times that he could bounce off of them. Good experiments make learning concrete and teach us truth.<br><br>I am seeing firsthand the value of experiments in my chemistry education research in Uganda. Last year Makerere University--which at 40,000 students is the largest university in East Africa and considered the most prestigious university in Uganda--had only two students declare chemistry as their major. The year before there was only one. What could be the reason for this? Here's a clue: students in Uganda are required to study four to six years of chemistry before they finish secondary school, yet few of them have opportunities to learn chemistry principles through hands-on experience--<i>through experimentation.</i> Many secondary schools lack the adequate equipment and supplies for chemistry labs and the facilities to handle the resulting lab waste. So for most students, chemistry is pure theory and rote memorization. Consequently, many of the students come to see it as too difficult and pointless.<br><br>As I have worked at Makerere University the past few summers I have seen the need for students to experience science hands-on to make the chemistry concepts come alive and become meaningful. My research team facilitates workshops designed to help secondary school teachers incorporate simple water-based experiments into their classes and labs. The team emphasizes exploration and experience, discovery and development.<br><br>The words <i>experiment</i> and <i>experience</i> have the same Latin root: they both come from the word <i>experior,</i> which means to gain knowledge through repeated trials. Let us think about the word <i>trial</i> for a minute, because for most of us, this word represents the difficult, even horrendous, experiences we have in life. But in the scientific world, the word <i>trial</i> has positive connotations. It refers to experiments repeated in order to learn something valuable. For example, a clinical trial can be used to study the effects of a new drug or medical procedure. In science, then, the word <i>trial</i> is not associated with the difficult parts of the experiment; it <i>is</i> the experiment.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Interestingly, the same Latin root is in the word <i>peritus,</i> or "tested," which is related to the word <i>peril,</i> reminding us that there are risks in experiments. We often don't find the results we would like, or there are sometimes unintended consequences, like an explosion in the lab. Yet it is through experimental trials that scientists collect enough data points to see patterns in their work and reveal truths about the world.<br><br>A sufficient number of trials actually lend <i>power</i> to an experiment. <i>Power</i> in this context is not talking about how important or valuable a clinical trial or its results are; it is referring to statistical power. This kind of power is derived from the number of observations and is one of the factors that gives confidence to an experiment's results. Francis Collins, who is the current director of the National Institute of Health, said:<br><br><i>When we fund a clinical trial, are we making sure that it has sufficient power--that it will enroll enough participants--to produce a meaningful result? Small trials with uncertain endpoints may cost less than larger, well-designed trials, but may not teach us what we need to know.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Curiously, a range of experimental trials can increase the probability of more successful results. In the book <i>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,</i> the authors Peter Brown, Henry Roediger III, and Mark McDaniel describe an experiment in which eight- and twelve-year-olds were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the control group, after the children were blindfolded, they practiced throwing beanbags at a target that was three feet away. In the treatment group, after the children were blindfolded, they practiced tossing beanbags at targets two feet and four feet away. Then both groups were given repeated feedback on their attempts. The students practiced for a couple of weeks, and then they were all tested on how well they could throw a beanbag three feet. And surprisingly, the treatment group that had worked on the two-foot and four-foot ranges but never on the three-foot range were much more likely to hit the bull's-eye accurately than the control group, which had only practiced the one perfect distance.<sup>5</sup> This experiment suggests that practicing a range of distances prepared the children to better hit the mark at testing time.<br><br>The Lord's plan--the plan of salvation--provides opportunities for learning in our temporal and spiritual lives, not simply for the sake of knowing but for the ability to do and become through a multitude of experiences. You might even describe what the adversary put forth--that we would always be forced to obey--as only one impoverished experience. Satan's version of the plan had neither power nor range.<br><br>I am grateful for the opportunity to practice and continually improve and to learn truths about what I am capable of and where I need to change. Honestly, I don't want the last time I cut someone off in traffic to be the single piece of evidence of who I am. Power comes when we see all our experiences--which are often trials in both senses of the word--simply as more opportunities to practice faith, patience, resilience, love, service, and forgiveness. Sure, I can forgive when it is my sister, but can I forgive when it is my brother? (I have six.) Or when I am tired, when I am angry, when I am busy, when I am wronged? Every experience in life would become another trial run, giving us power to discover the truth about our lives and how we can change to become more like our Savior.<br><br>One of my favorite missionary companions in Brazil was a convert who had joined the Church at age sixteen. Sister Adriana had grown up in a family that owned a bar, and she had started drinking at an early age. She told me she was addicted and that giving up alcohol was the hardest thing she had ever done. When we taught investigators the Word of Wisdom, I could certainly share my witness of its truth, but she would share about craving alcohol and then testify that she would rather feel the Spirit, and she couldn't do both. She had felt redemption from the Savior's Atonement in this part of her life, and she could testify with power.<br><br>That is not to say that you have to have every experience in order to find truth and fulfill your potential. You don't have to experiment with things that draw you away from God. Thankfully, our own experiences are not the only ones we have to rely on. This is one of the reasons we have family and gospel stories and pass down wisdom from generation to generation. "If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants," was the acknowledgment of Sir Isaac Newton.<sup>6</sup><br><br>In fact, when we designed our experiments in Uganda, we didn't have to test everything. We were able to structure the workshops using literature on science education in teacher development workshops in the United States. Likewise, when I listened to my companion's testimony of the Word of Wisdom, it confirmed my own beliefs without me having to experience what she went through.<br><h2><b>Become Stronger from Struggles</b></h2><br>There is a saying that "the truth will set you free, but first it will make you miserable." These words sure feel true sometimes, but we have a superior way of looking at life's experiences so that they turn from trials in the purely hardship sense to trials in the cumulative knowledge sense. Christ doesn't just give us options, He gives us the power to make good choices, the power to repent and begin again after making bad choices, and the power to identify truths from our experiences. President Howard W. Hunter taught, "If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/howard-w-hunter_fear-little-flock/"><sup>7</sup></a> With the Atonement my mistakes do not become permanent but instead are another trial run as I am learning how to become like Him.<br><br>When we find ourselves in a horrible experience, because of either our own bad choices or the decisions of others, we can learn to turn tragedy into victory by using the Atonement. Remember in Doctrine and Covenants 122 when Joseph Smith was in Liberty Jail? The Lord described all the ways in which the world could--and would--turn against Joseph and then counseled: "Know thou, my son, that <i>all</i> these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>8</sup> We certainly can learn important skills and strengthen our faith by coming out of a trial even stronger than when we entered. Even if it is a hard experience, we can choose to see it as an opportunity to live and experiment.<br><br>Christ Himself showed us the importance of obtaining a body and experiencing life. Why couldn't Christ just study the plan of salvation and learn what His role was in the Atonement? Why couldn't He just know all things? He came to earth. He experienced the rough waves in a ship and the calming power of the priesthood during a storm. He experienced the love and kindness of His mother and father, the gentleness of the woman who washed His feet with her tears, the gratitude of a leper He had healed, and the grief of friends when Lazarus died. He experienced the tenderness of Mary weeping for Him when she did not find Him in the tomb. He experienced Gethsemane, the cross, and cruelty. It wasn't enough to theoretically know; He experienced the reality of mortality that He might know and understand what we experience. He suffered and died for us that we might experiment and live. I share my witness of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. We will be resurrected with our bodies after this life. With Christ's help we can repent; we can change and become the person God wants us to be.<br><h2><b>Develop a Growth Mind-Set</b></h2><br>So how do we truly learn from our experiments--the kind of learning that brings us closer to Christ?<br><br>Reverend Thomas Bayes, the patron saint of statisticians, proposed a method for updating prior knowledge with newer experimental results.<sup>9</sup> If my daily focus is to be a good driver and a kind person, a single incident of distractedly cutting someone off shouldn't have sufficient weight to convince me that I am a bad driver. But it is a valuable data point that challenges me to renew my efforts to be more conscientious in my driving <i>and</i> to react charitably when others cut me off. However, if in my search for truth I find patterns in my behavior that do not fit with my view of myself, that evidence needs to be given more weight as I look to make necessary changes.<br><br>Professor Carol Dweck at Stanford University has spent twenty-five years researching how people's self-concept matters in how they react to disappointment and failure. What do they do with results they don't like? In one of her seminal studies she gave visual IQ tests to fifth graders and then randomly assigned what type of feedback each was given. In one treatment group the students were told they had performed well and were <i>praised for their intelligence.</i> In the other treatment group the students were told they had performed well and were <i>praised for their hard work.</i><br><br>Next the children were given opportunities to practice different types of questions, and the students praised for their effort overwhelmingly picked harder problems than the students praised for being smart. Then Dweck's team gave the fifth graders a seventh-grade IQ test, which they all bombed, but the kids praised for effort performed better than those praised for their intelligence. This makes sense in retrospect, I suppose, given how the different groups had practiced. But then Dweck's team did something especially clever: they readministered the same fifth-grade test the children had all aced earlier. Again the effort-praised children outperformed the intelligence-praised ones. But here is the surprising thing: the kids praised for being smart actually did worse than they had in the first round of testing. It was almost as if they had grown dumber. Once they no longer believed they were smart, they weren't.<sup>10</sup><br><br>Dweck has proposed that there are two basic mind-sets: a growth mind-set and a fixed mind-set.<sup>11</sup> The assumption of those with a growth mind-set is that intelligence, creativity, artistic ability, or other traits are flexible, not frozen, and that they can increase with continual practice. The assumption of those with a fixed mind-set is that traits are inherent and cannot be changed. The problem with the fixed mind-set is the belief that an outcome is somehow a comment on a person's very nature. If I cut someone off in traffic, it not only says that I am a bad driver but that I am a bad person. If I fail an exam it means that I am not intelligent. In contrast, a person with the growth mind-set sees mistakes and failures as data points that can be used as Reverend Bayes proposed: to update prior knowledge in order to improve.<br><br>Our daughter Abi is a talented runner. When she was a freshman in high school she became very focused on her performance--in showing how fast she was--and she feared failing because that would mean she wasn't talented. One particularly hot fall afternoon she chose not to run in a meet because it just seemed too hard for her to run well. In contrast, by her senior year she used each meet, regardless of circumstances, to learn how she could improve. She scored in every race. She ended up as her team's most consistent runner, placing better at nearly every meet, and she ran in the state championship. She demonstrated a shift from a fixed mind-set to a growth mind-set.<br><br>The good news, which Dweck's subsequent research showed, is that you can learn to have a growth mind-set and see yourself more as a work in progress who will improve with time and effort. I have seen many of you in my classes develop more of a growth mind-set while learning chemistry. The really "good news"--<i>god spiel,</i> or <i>gospel,</i> in Old English--is that Christ's Atonement is very real and that we are not fixed but can always flex and grow.<br><h2><b>Do Hard Things with Help from Others</b></h2><br>My own life experiments have been possible because of the people with whom I collaborate. For years our family motto has been "Nielsons do hard things." (You can imagine that our kids have not always been fond of the family motto.) However, we were rescued so many times our first summer in Africa that we actually changed our motto to "Nielsons do hard things with help from God and others."<br><br>At one point I was traveling in rural Uganda to meet the organizer of a women's co-op. It was raining hard and the streets were not paved. By the time we arrived at the house, my friend Kristyn and I were muddy. I really hesitated though to take off my shoes to enter the house. They were fairly expensive walking sandals; I had bought them specifically because I knew I would be walking a lot in Africa that summer. With some anxiety I left them on the front porch.<br><br>When I stepped in the house I was astonished to see a paper on the refrigerator that read "As Sisters in Zion." Kristyn and I actually starting singing, and then a lilting voice joined us from the other room. I then noticed a picture of the First Presidency of the Church on the wall. We were in this little slice of heaven. Our new friend greeted us with a very traditional and gracious Ugandan greeting: "You are welcome." And we responded by saying "thank you," which is the opposite of what we do in the United States. This woman was in the Mukono Ward, and her husband was the bishop. She told us her story and we met her kids. It was a glorious hour.<br><br>When we exited the house, my shoes were gone. I will admit that my soul sank. All those lovely feelings fled. Then from around the corner of the house came a neighbor holding my clean shoes. It must have taken her the whole hour to remove the caked-on mud. She simply said, "You are welcome." I felt the love of God and the goodness of people. Those shoes mattered to me right then only because they had given me the experience of seeing the kindness of strangers and realizing again that <i>any</i> hard thing I have done really has come through the help of God and others.<br><br>I love the ways that you serve and connect to each other. I see you doing this all the time. Earlier this semester one of my students came to me distraught over failing a midterm. We discussed several ways she might improve: taking the practice exam as if it were real, forming a study group, teaching the principles to others, and trying more problems. She listened, she adjusted, and she aced the next midterm. Last week during office hours a different student expressed dismay at her performance on the midterm. The first student overheard her and immediately invited the discouraged classmate to join her study group and learn from the group's collective experience. Love from others is essential when we are not having the experience we want.<br><h2><b>Embrace Experience Without Fear</b></h2><br>There will be many times that we have an experience we don't want. So what else can we do? May I suggest, with apologies to Stephen Stills: If you can't be with the experience you love, honey, love the experience you're with.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Rabbi Ronnie Cahana had a stroke affecting his brain stem in 2011. The effect of the stroke was slow enough that he was aware as his body gradually became paralyzed, starting from his legs and traveling up to just below his eyes. The condition is known as locked-in syndrome. Family and friends learned to communicate by saying the alphabet and then having him blink when they got to the right letter, thereby spelling out any message.<br><br>Rabbi Cahana's reaction to this experience was incredible. He spent hours pondering the beauty of God and life, wondering that he could experience such an exceptional state. He said that at night his mind would soar and he would be in motion, "swirling and twirling" above the ground. By blinking his eyes he wrote letters and sermons sharing his experience. He declared, "I want you to know that this too, is healige (holy in Yiddish). I am in a broken place, but there is holy work to be done."<sup>13</sup> His willingness to search for truths in this trial helped him to transcend his misery.<br><br>In a TEDMED talk his daughter said that the family cocooned him in love.<sup>14</sup> He imagined moving his fingers while his loving family physically moved them in therapy. And then his body rekindled. Slowly he began to feel electrical sensations in his arms. He eventually regained enough feeling to be able to breathe on his own and then to talk with his own voice. Every day he witnessed another miracle. His body developed like a baby's, but he observed it with all the experience of a fifty-seven-year-old mind and felt wonder and gratitude. He used his new understanding of truth to grow and was, remarkably, not afraid. The truth had set him free.<br><br>If we are not afraid, our life experiments can be tools to learn truth and to make changes. The pioneer chemist Marie Curie believed that "nothing in life is to be feared--it is only to be understood."<sup>15</sup> My daughter Catie is in a class this semester studying Mormon women, and she shared with me the story of another pioneer, Jean Rio Griffiths Baker, who, like many new converts from England, had to face an ocean of unknowns to travel to the United States to be with the Saints. In 1851, before she set out to cross the plains to Utah, she wrote in her journal, "The future will most likely be an account of trials, difficulties, and privations such as at present I have no idea of, so as to be able to provide against them. But as you are aware I am not one to go through the world with my eyes shut."<sup>16</sup><br><br>Paul taught us how to approach life experiences using the Savior's Atonement. One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Timothy 1:7 because of the three gifts from God that are specifically mentioned: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."<br><br>Our earth life--and for us, this university life--is a unique place for exploration, experience, and discovery. Let us use our life experiments to turn theory into reality with Christ's help. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jennifer B.

I feel honored and humbled to have received the assignment from the First Presidency to speak to you precious young people today. I hope that you have an appreciation of how much the prophet and the First Presidency care about you and love you. You are among "the noble and great."<sup>1</sup><br><br>[A man arrived] <i>home from work to find a very small girl sitting on the curb in front of his house, crying. He asked if he could help. Through her sobs she explained that she was lost. He told her that this was his house and his wife was inside. He told her he knew she shouldn't go with strangers, but if she felt comfortable going inside, he and his wife would try to find her home. They went into his house, and his wife, Linda, began to console the little girl. "I'm sure you must be very frightened," she said.</i><br><br><i>"I was frightened," the girl responded, "until I saw the picture of Jesus hanging on your wall. Then I knew I would be safe."</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>It is the same for us all. The answer always is Jesus Christ. At times you may feel that you are sitting on the curb lost and afraid, but if you will look to the Savior, He will guide you safely home. He is the one infallible source of help for each of us, my dear young adult friends.<br><br>One of the most profound and sublime of gospel understandings is the doctrine of law. It is stated so simply in the Doctrine and Covenants: "That which is governed by law is also <i>preserved</i> by law and <i>perfected</i> and <i>sanctified</i> by the same."<sup>3</sup> By law, the Father governs us within His great plan of happiness. He sent His Son to show us the way. We learn of Him. We follow Him. We have faith in Him. We pray in His name. Because of His enabling Atonement we can grow, repent, and do what is necessary to invite the fulness of Heavenly Father's blessings. And we do <i>all</i> of this by law. Within the law, each of us is fully responsible. To have the law work in our lives, we must act; we must stand up from the curb and follow Him.<br><br>In my sweet interactions with young people in both single and married stakes and as a mission president, I have seen how each young person must discover and then choose to walk his or her own personal path. Sometimes we are tempted to measure our progress by looking at what others are doing or have achieved. Your path is unique to you. Only you can receive heavenly guidance to pursue your path. If you choose to take detours, then you and only you can find your way back. President Henry B. Eyring taught:<br><br><i>Heavenly Father has perfect foresight, knows each of us, and knows our future. He knows what difficulties we will pass through. He sent His Son to suffer so that He would know how to succor us in all our trials.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Christ understands and is aware of your personal young adult decisions; your questions, hopes, dreams, and needs; and the intents of your heart<sup>5</sup>--and even your temptations. These key years are vitally important in your eternal life. No longer are they just "preparatory" years for your future. They <i>are</i> your future. Of course you will continue to grow, but the "now" of your young adult years is foundational to your "divine destiny as an heir of eternal life." <sup>6</sup> The answers for you are always in Jesus Christ as you do your part to follow Him.<br><br>Will you look carefully with me at Christ's own young adult years to find patterns that you may follow as you answer the whys, whats, and hows of life? How did He prepare and navigate His own path? What specific lessons did He learn? What did He need to do to achieve the fulness of His mortal experience? Let us look at four things that Christ Himself did in His formative years.<br><h2><b>1. Christ Learned Through His Own Experiences</b></h2><br>We must remember that Christ came to mortality as a God. In condescension God Himself came down to the lowest station in mortality, yet He was "full of grace and truth." <sup>7</sup> He was not here to be tested as we are. He was already God. He did not need to learn faith. He had all power and all knowledge and held the keys from His Father for the salvation of all of Heavenly Father's children. <sup>8</sup> Yet with all that, He did not possess the fulness at first. He, God the Son, had to learn some things in mortality that He apparently could not have known otherwise. Paul told us that He <i>"learned . . . obedience by the things which he suffered."</i><sup>9</sup> The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us in section 93:<br><br><i>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; </i><br><br><i>. . . until he received a fulness. . . . </i><br><br><i>And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son. </i><br><br><i>And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>This completeness for Him came <i>after</i> His years of preparation--at the age of thirty as He was about to <i>begin</i> His ministry. These thirty years--His formative young adult years--were to teach Him the things He personally needed to understand by experience.<br><br>What about you? Can you identify your own learning and applying of eternal principles of the law through your own experiences? Are you "filling" your soul? You can become more complete men and women of Christ, especially in these stretching and learning years of today.<br><br>I suspect that even in Christ's learning years He developed through a multitude of small choices rather than just through a few monumental decisions. You may not even recognize the significance of little day-to-day choices that you make today until later in life as you see the unfolding of the consequences of your choices today.<br><br>I decided early that I wanted to become a physician and, because of certain circumstances, was able to start at the university early. I focused on completing as many pre-med courses as possible before my mission and even went to school in the summer so that I could finish the physics series. Because I had nearly completed my pre-med requirements, with permission I took the MCAT test on a Saturday while I was in the Language Training Mission before my mission to Mexico. As I look back now, it seems impossible, even crazy. But that crazy yet inspired process allowed me to come home and then apply for and be ready to start medical school just weeks after my sweetheart, Marsha, and I were married. I was twenty-two. I couldn't foresee the future, but at one step at a time it unfolded and felt right.<br><br>More important than our secular details, which can be measured, things were happening inside of me and inside of us as a couple. We were blessed with two sons while I was in medical school and with three more sons during my residency. We paid our meager tithing, as you do, and learned to contribute fast offerings. We read scriptures daily, prayed, and attended the temple, as you do. We accepted callings and served others, even when it was seemingly inconvenient. This wonderful process of learning, applying, and becoming was happening for us. We were experiencing what we personally needed to know and understand and could not learn any other way.<br><h2><b>2. Christ Grew</b></h2><br>In the very few verses of scripture that we have describing Christ's young adult years, we learn about the patterns of His learning process. He "<i>increased</i> in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."<sup>11</sup> He "waxed strong." <sup>12</sup> While "[growing] up with his brethren," <sup>13</sup> He learned and applied the very celestial attributes He later taught.<br><br>He was always perfect, but surely His young adult growing years were not easy. Did His siblings even like Him? Did they understand Him? What was daily life like? Did He get sick? Did He want to heal His family when they got sick? In Christ's later life He taught--likely reflecting upon His own experience--that "a prophet [has] honour, [except] in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house." <sup>14</sup> His was not a test of faith but a test of constant perfection--with His complete knowledge and power--in an imperfect world. Waxing strong must have included for Him, as it does for us, perfecting those very attributes that He exemplified.<br><br>Please note that your growth is not defined by external circumstances or appearances. Your growth is personal and comes from within. You are defined by how you discover your own path and then overcome all of the obstacles that seem to make it hard to progress. Elder Neal A. Maxwell often taught about our "customized curriculum" <sup>15</sup>--that which we personally need to learn and experience. I remember during those difficult years of medical training working more than 100 hours a week at the hospital, trying to support a little family; serving in heavy Church assignments; and hearing Elder Boyd K. Packer talk about "packages of provisions" <sup>16</sup> provided personally for us at critical times along the way. The Father knows our needs and knows our future. He sends us sustaining blessings just as we need them--but, in our experience, only as we are doing our best. Increasing in wisdom, stature, and favor requires our moral agency and action.<br><br>I asked our children, former BYU students, to share key lessons they had learned here. One said, "I had to decide what was important and do it, even if it was hard."<br><br>In the university stake in which I most recently served, we saw these same lessons unfold in the lives of precious young married students who were seeking high educational goals even when those goals seemed impossible; beginning a family even when desperately poor; and humbly serving the Lord, especially when it was hard.<br><br>"Hard" has always been part of the formula. "Hard" seems to be required for growth. The Savior learned and suffered through personal, deep, searing contradictions and indignities that He humbly allowed.<br><br><i>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, . . . </i><br><br><i>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor</i> [us] <i>that are tempted.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br><i>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>In Joseph Smith's deepest learning experience in Liberty Jail, the Savior taught him that he needed to learn by his own experience the attributes that He, the Savior, had perfected. Perhaps these very attributes represent the fulness that we are all seeking to attain. The Savior enumerated them: patience, gentleness, kindness, meekness, persuasion, love unfeigned, and long-suffering<sup>19</sup>--not only suffering the contradictions and indignities of life but humbly allowing them.<br><br>The prophet Lehi foresaw the Savior in that indignity and suffering:<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>You too must learn and apply these celestial attributes as He did. Sometimes they may seem to be forced upon you. But you cannot learn the fulness without them.<br><h2><b>3. Christ Waited for the Time of His Ministry</b></h2><br>Christ "waited upon the Lord for the time of his ministry to come." <sup>21</sup> Did His waiting mean inaction or the equivalent of just playing video games while waiting for circumstances to come together to make it <i>easy</i> to begin His ministry? At age twelve He urgently said to His mother, after teaching the elders in the temple for three days, "I <i>must</i> be about my Father's business." <sup>22</sup> Then He was required to be patient and wait for another <i>eighteen years</i> to begin His critical mortal ministry. Surely this was a difficult, stretching time as He experienced the infirmities that are common to us all. Throughout this learning process He was tutored by the Spirit.<br><br>Isaiah taught, "And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord." <sup>23</sup> Christ did nothing "but the will of [His] Father." <sup>24</sup> He waited for His Father's will and then fulfilled it perfectly. "And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, having lived with his father." <sup>25</sup> "And after many years, the hour of his ministry drew nigh." <sup>26</sup><br><br>Let me share with you a time of waiting upon the Lord in our family. We asked our teenage children to be home by 9:30 on a Saturday night. There would be an envelope waiting. One of the children read aloud, over the signature of the First Presidency, a mission call for our family. Suddenly everything changed--the future of the football team, the dance company, violin and piano lessons, lawn jobs, friends, and dreams. There were tears.<br><br>We went from room to room that night wiping wet cheeks and rubbing backs. In our seventeen-year-old son's room we found him ramrod straight on the edge of his bed looking across to his bulletin board, where there were pictures of his football team, his brother on a mission, his family, the prophet, and Jesus Christ.<br><br>By morning all eyes were dry, and sitting on the second row in sacrament meeting, we sang, "I'll go where [and when and how and why] you want me to go, dear Lord." <sup>27</sup> We waited to find out where that would be. We waited as we put our lives in order, shifted vision, adjusted expectations, and squared our shoulders. We watched through each new step, through the living of it, and through what was hard and what was wonderful, until years later each child, in his or her own way, said, "Everything that is good in our lives is because we served."<br><br>We each come to learn our Father's will for us, but the Lord's timing is not always our timing. Yet His way is always good. "All things work together for good to them that love God." <sup>28</sup> If there was great purpose in Christ's waiting "upon the Lord" during His young years, there must be a vital need for you to also wait upon the Lord.<br><br>Faithful, patient waiting implies that we strive daily to do the little things: daily scripture study, no matter our schedules; daily prayers with hearts drawn out always; daily worthiness for the companionship of the Holy Ghost; and daily diligence to keep our environment fit for the Spirit. Are you waiting for some external circumstance to compel you to action? Are you waiting to be perfectly assured of the end before you dare to begin? Are you waiting upon the Lord or sometimes just waiting <i>until</i> you graduate or marry or begin a family or qualify for life's work before you fully commit? When does your ministry begin? Is it now? Don't you think that waiting upon the Lord meant for Jesus Christ exactly what it means for you--doing what still needs to be done to wax strong, to increase, to grow, and to prepare every day to be ready for the next choice or learning experience?<br><br>Young adult years can seem to be all about you. Rightly, you are focused on your education, hopes, dreams, and goals. You have responsibilities and important things to do. But when everything threatens to revolve around you and only what you want--when, how, and with whom--then it is time to consider a caution. President Eyring said in his recent address at the Colloquium on the Family at the Vatican that the root problem in families and in marriages is <i>selfishness.</i> You must learn <i>now,</i> my dear young friends, to become <i>unselfish</i> so that you can be happy in marriage and family and life. As you genuinely serve others now, you will be more able to give of yourself eternally to your spouse and to your children. Brothers and sisters, be sure that the timing of your willingness to enter into marriage is not affected by any degree of selfishness. As you learn to look outside yourself, you open unending possibilities of joy and happiness, and you will come to know even more personally your Heavenly Father's gifts to you.<br><h2><b>4. Christ Made Covenants and Received Ordinances</b></h2><br>Like each of us, Christ began with baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Ordinances are the greatest eternal privilege that the Lord has made available to us in mortality. Accompanying covenants allow access to the full blessings of the Father, who is bound by eternal law to keep His promises to His faithful children. It is His work and glory, and that of His Son, to prepare us for the fulness of His blessings, but, by law, He can <i>only</i> bless us after we have made covenants with Him and are faithfully keeping them. <sup>29</sup> Even the blessings of the Atonement can only come freely after we make covenants at baptism, continually apply them in our daily lives, and regularly renew them at the sacrament table.<br><br><i>And . . . then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is <b>in the covenant of the Father</b> unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>The temple is where we participate in the covenants and ordinances that extend beyond this mortality and endure throughout all eternity. There we are invited to proceed forward in progressive covenants to help us prepare for the highest blessings Heavenly Father has to offer. "In the ordinances . . . , <i>the power of godliness is manifest.</i>"<sup>31</sup> Only in the temple can we make eternal covenants that embody truth, understanding, purpose, Spirit, power, and meaning and that teach us who we are and who we can become. In March 1844 the Prophet Joseph Smith met with the Twelve and taught, "We need the temple more than anything else." <sup>32</sup><br><br>Young friends, you need the temple. You need the temple perhaps more now than at any other time in your mortal life. Elder John A. Widtsoe said:<br><br><i>Temple work is . . . of as much benefit to the young and the active, as it is to the aged, who have laid behind them many of the burdens of life. The young man needs his place in the temple even more than his father and his grandfather, who are steadied by a life of experience; and the young girl just entering life, needs the spirit, influence and direction that come from participation in the temple ordinances.</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>I recently had the privilege of being with an Apostle of God as he gathered his large family around a sealing altar during a temple open house. He told his dear ones that <i>everything</i> we do in the Church is to prepare us to come to the altars in the temple someday. A son recently shared with me how important the temple was to him when he was a single student making weighty decisions. I felt this among young couples who, hardly a dollar past needing assistance themselves, faithfully contributed tithing, fast offerings, and even to the perpetual education fund. I saw this again as I met with the ordinance workers from the Provo Temple in their annual devotional and was brought to tears as I asked workers who were under thirty years of age to stand. Fully one-fourth of the congregation stood. More than nine hundred young, endowed brothers and sisters are serving.<br><br>Every one of you can hold a current temple recommend--either a limited-use recommend or a full recommend. Your bishop is there to guide you and help you to qualify yourself. Holding a recommend, you can use it regularly and frequently. You only make and receive covenants and ordinances for yourself one time. But each time you return to the temple as proxy for others, your own blessings and promises are renewed. Your bishop is the key as you consider when it is right for you to receive your own endowment. Counsel with him. He will know the recent direction of the First Presidency regarding the appropriate circumstances for you, especially sisters, who desire to go to the temple. As you and your bishop counsel together, and as the Spirit confirms that you are ready to receive this great blessing, for all of the right reasons, you may do so.<br><br>You are blessed to have a very busy temple here and to have other temples nearby. You know that going to the temple involves a plan, a little sacrifice, and even some opposition. Sometimes the baptistry is crowded or the sessions are full. You might have to wait longer than you had hoped, but the spiritual power, revelatory help, and inspired insights will come no matter the details of your temple worship. Don't stay away because it may take longer. Come to the temple for the living water. Do your very best, and the Lord will honor your efforts. Hold a recommend, my dear young friends, and do the best you can to use it regularly and frequently. Then watch for the blessings.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we have looked to Christ for guidance in your young adult years. We have seen that in His young years<br><br>• He learned<br>• He increased<br>• He waited upon the Lord<br>• He made covenants and received ordinances<br><br>You too can <i>learn</i> through experiences on your own personal path. You too can <i>increase</i> with consistent, directional movement forward, finding happiness all along the way. You too can <i>wait upon the Lord,</i> acting with energy and faith, doing the very best you can as you watch for His timing and His ways. You too can <i>make covenants</i> and <i>receive ordinances</i> and then faithfully keep them, renew them, and watch for their promised blessings.<br><br>Eternal law declares that you and I must do our part to be ready to receive all that Heavenly Father intends for us to have. Dear friends, as you follow this pattern from Christ's own young years, you will be blessed and will come to live and love the Christlike attributes that He exemplified. The Father sent His Son to show us and to teach us. This one reliable source will give infallible help if you will follow the Savior now in your young adult years.<br><br>At times you may feel that you are sitting on the curbs of life lost and afraid, but if you will look to the Savior, He will guide you safely home.<br><br><i>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</i><br><br><i>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross. . . .</i><br><br><i>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>My witness to you today, dear friends, is that in all of your circumstances, the answer is in Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>Kent F.

<h1>Discipleship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to be here with you today. I come from a family of migrant farm workers, and I learned many lessons laboring with my parents and grandparents in the fields, vineyards, and orchards of the Central Valley of California. The Central Valley has some of the richest soil in the world, and farmers report that 100 percent of the nation's raisins,<sup>1</sup> 99 percent of its almonds,<sup>2</sup> and 95 percent of its olives<sup>3</sup> are produced there.<br><br>My life changed forever when two young missionaries first visited our Central Valley home during the winter prior to my fourteenth birthday. My father was expert in the "law of the barrio," also known as "street law." He was highly skeptical of strangers and fiercely protective of our family. My mother recently reminded me of the time he called the police because he had spied someone who drove by and put a bomb into our mailbox. The police quickly responded to investigate, only to discover a batch of chocolate chip cookies. Obviously we were not used to the kindnesses expressed by members of the Church.<br><br>It was one of the greatest miracles I have ever witnessed when my father allowed the missionaries into our home. Because of the work of the missionaries, my father and mother and my younger brother, David, and I decided to become members of the Church.<br><br>One of the first activities I attended after my baptism was a church youth dance. I don't remember what I expected to experience, but when I walked into that church building and saw all of those beautiful Mormon girls, I knew the Church was true!<br><br>I am grateful to the missionaries who taught me the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the youth of the Church who welcomed me into a new way of life. Since those early years, family and friends, including many students, continue to teach me much about being a more devoted disciple of the Savior. Today I would like to share some thoughts with you on that topic.<br><h2><b>Pruning of the Vine</b></h2><br>I remember the foggy winter days I worked preparing raisin grape vineyards for the coming season's harvest. The vines were overrun with the past season's growth and needed pruning in order to produce good fruit. We would remove the suckers and the old and dead wood from the plant. We would then tie the new wood, or vines, to guide wires that were stretched between anchor posts. The vines were then fully exposed to the life-giving light of the sun and could produce plentiful fruit for the harvest.<br><br>Likening the vines to ourselves, we must be willing to allow the Lord to prune those dispositions, attributes, and cares of the world that prevent us from becoming devoted disciples of Jesus Christ.<sup>4</sup> The Savior is the Lord of the vineyard and does the pruning. The guideposts of the vineyard are the principles of the gospel. The guide wires are the scriptures and the words of the living prophets. The light that gives light to the vine is the Spirit of the Lord. By allowing this pruning process, we can more fully expose our lives to that life-giving light so that we can produce plentiful fruit for the harvest.<br><h2><b>Measuring Our Devotion to the Savior</b></h2><br>Years ago Elder Neal A. Maxwell, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, visited our Central California stake. A visit from an apostle of the Lord was rare, and we all felt extremely privileged to have Elder Maxwell visit. At the time, Elder Maxwell was suffering from cancer, and the difficulty of his movement to and from the pulpit was quite apparent. Yet he was undeterred by his physical condition. He taught us powerfully, by word and deed, how we can measure our devotion to the Savior--a message he also delivered in general conference. He said:<br><br><i>Let our gratitude . . . be expressed by striving to become, attribute by attribute, more and more as Jesus is (see 3 Ne. 27:27). By so living, ours will not then be a mere <b>appreciation</b> of Jesus, nor a modest <b>admiration</b> of Him. Rather, ours will be an <b>adoration</b> of Jesus expressed by our <b>emulation</b> of Him!</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>In light of Elder Maxwell's counsel, we might ask ourselves where we stand on this continuum. Do we merely appreciate the Savior? Do we have a modest admiration of Him, or does our personal worship lead to daily decisions to more fully emulate Him?<br><h2><b>Expressing Our Devotion to the Savior--Emulating His Attributes</b></h2><br>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:<br><br><i>The virtues outlined by Peter are part of the divine nature, or the Savior's character. These are the virtues we are to emulate if we would be more like Him.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Here is Peter's counsel to disciples in all ages:<br><br><i>Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; </i><br><br><i>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; </i><br><br><i>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I believe it is significant that Peter counsels us to "add" one attribute to another, which suggests that our progression on the path to the greatest attribute, charity, is not attainable without some level of mastery of each of the preceding attributes. It has been helpful for me to view this path as an elevated continuum on which we can measure our progression.<br><br>As we study these attributes together, I pray that the Holy Ghost can teach each of us where we may be along the continuum and bring to our remembrance areas of improvement we can undertake in order to propel us forward and upward along the path to a more devoted discipleship.<br><h3><b><i>Faith</i></b></h3><br>The first step on the pathway to devoted discipleship is to exercise faith in the Savior's power to lift us to higher ground.<br><br>In my opinion, one of the most sorrowful episodes in all scripture is the story of the young rich ruler. The scriptures tell us that the young ruler enthusiastically asked Jesus what he needed to do in order to gain eternal life. It was clear he appreciated or perhaps even admired Jesus. Jesus detailed the requirements of the law of Moses to the young ruler, who replied that he had kept these commandments all his life.<br><br>The young ruler then asked the Savior a pivotal question on which the test of his devotion would turn: "What lack I yet?"<sup>8</sup><br><br><i>Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>The young ruler went away sorrowful. Jesus had asked the young ruler for increased devotion--a commitment to keep a higher law. Can we imagine ourselves in a personal interview with the Savior in which He asks us to rise to the next level of devotion? Would we walk away sorrowful? Do we have faith in His ability to lift us to higher ground?<br><h3><b><i>Virtue</i></b></h3><br>Add unto faith virtue. The Savior said:<br><br><i>The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>What enters our eyes can corrupt us both physically and spiritually. The time we spend with technology as well as what we choose to view can be measurements of our virtue.<br><br>Recently Arthur C. Brooks, a renowned social scientist, wrote an op-ed in the <i>New York Times</i> titled "The Trick to Being More Virtuous." In his article Brooks explained that what we choose to access on the Internet says much about our desires and thus our virtue. Borrowing a phrase from Brooks, we might ask ourselves, "What will my next click say about [me]?"<sup>11</sup> Will it elevate my desires and my virtue?<br><br>We are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times with unprecedented advances in communication and access to information. This can be a great blessing to us and to others as we participate in hastening the work of the Lord. The Apostle Paul, however, foresaw the perilous times in which we would live when he said that many would be "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup>12</sup> Aimless surfing of the Internet seems to fit his prophetic statement.<br><br>On the other hand, increased time in the scriptures can help us "to know the mysteries of God [and to] be given to reveal things which never have been revealed."<sup>13</sup> That is exciting to contemplate. The opportunity to study secular knowledge in the light of the gospel is what makes BYU a unique place. This kind of integrated learning can and does happen on this campus. Consider the blessing you can be to the world if your communications and your search for knowledge are focused and have this purpose in mind. The power of our learning environment is increased collectively as we individually allow "virtue [to] garnish [our] thoughts unceasingly."<sup>14</sup><br><h3><b><i>Knowledge</i></b></h3><br>Add to your virtue knowledge. We should diligently seek to know and appropriately use our spiritual gifts to liberate others from temporal and spiritual bondage.<br><br>If you are struggling to understand the direction you might take with your education or your career, I urge you to carefully study and understand the gifts of the Spirit. I believe the process of making your educational and career choices can be enhanced by discovering and using your unique spiritual gifts. The doctrine of spiritual gifts is set forth in the New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants--three distinctive canons of scripture. I believe this adds additional significance to their importance.<br><br>Consider some of these marvelous gifts:<br><br>• the gift of knowledge<br>• the gift of wisdom<br>• the gift of discernment<br>• the gift of tongues<br>• the gift of healing<br>• the gift of understanding the diversity of operations<br>• the gift of knowing the differences of administration<sup>15</sup><br><br>In addition to gifts of the Spirit, we each have unique aptitudes, abilities, capacities, and talents to offer this world. Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught:<br><br><i>When we pass from preexistence to mortality, we bring with us the traits and talents there developed. . . . And all men with their infinitely varied talents and personalities pick up the course of progression where they left it off when they left the heavenly realms.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>My grandfather, Carl Hernandez Sr., immigrated to the United States from Mexico and settled in the Central Valley of California, where he worked as a grafter of fruit trees. Grafting is useful for many purposes, including providing trees with a strong root system that is resistant to drought, disease, decay, and poor soil conditions. Grafting also allows for an increased production of desirable fruit.<br><br>The rootstock, which consists of the roots and the trunk of a tree, forms the foundation for the graft. Like a growing tree, you have a strong rootstock. Your divine nature as a child of heavenly parents gives you the potential to become like Them. On a grafted tree, branches from another tree, or scions, are attached to a strong, established rootstock. You possess natural gifts, aptitudes, capacities, and talents that are part of your rootstock. We have also been commanded to earnestly seek after "the best gifts"<sup>17</sup> as well as additional talents.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Acquired gifts and talents are like the scions that are attached to our rootstock. Increasing your spiritual gifts and talents will allow you to "bear much fruit."<sup>19</sup><br><br>I invite you to gain a knowledge of your unique natural gifts and talents and to diligently seek and acquire others. The integration of your spiritual gifts into the work you do in this life can both empower you and add joy in your service to others.<br><h3><b><i>Temperance</i></b></h3><br>Add unto knowledge temperance. Temperance requires that we exercise self-control over an impulse to think, act, or speak out in a way that is inconsistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Consider the following hypothetical situation. You are late to class and are driving around what appears to be a full Y lot looking for a parking stall. Suddenly one appears, and you patiently wait as the driver exits the stall, only to have someone swerve in from the opposite direction to take the spot. How you react in this hypothetical situation can say a lot about whether you are a temperate person. This past year a national television station dedicated an entire news story titled "Parking Lot Wars" to reporting the broad spectrum of behaviors shown by those who have parking-stall encounters.<sup>20</sup> People have lost lives, limbs, and their dignity because they have been unable to temper their thoughts, words, and deeds in these simple circumstances.<br><br>Our daily reactions, simple or complex, should be <i>tempered</i> by always keeping an eternal perspective in focus.<br><h3><b><i>Patience</i></b></h3><br>Add to temperance patience. When I was a young boy, my grandparents, Ignacio and Patricia Noriega, patiently taught me how to pick olives. Olives are harvested by carefully "milking" each olive from each branch of the tree. It is one of the most tedious and labor intensive of all farm labor tasks.<br><br>One thing I learned early in my picking experience is that olives off the tree don't exactly taste like the olives you eat out of the can! The fruit is hard and extremely bitter. Just in case you are tempted, this is not an item you would want to add to your "raw food" diet.<br><br>In order for an olive to become edible, it must be processed in a lye solution for several days in order to leach out the bitter taste.<br><br>Like this process, the bitter challenges and chastenings of life, both large and small, require that we exercise patience, endure well, and trust in the Lord's ability to cleanse and purify us. The Apostle Paul taught:<br><br><i>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness.</i><sup>21</sup><br><h3><b><i>Godliness</i></b></h3><br>Add to patience godliness. A few years ago my brother gave me some of the mission statements that his brothers in the Hanford California Third Branch had written. Here are a few lines from those statements:<br><br>I want to lift the hands that hang down and strengthen the feeble knees.<br><br>Is anything too hard for the Lord?<br><br>I will always say, "Here am I, Lord, send me!"<br><br>At first glance, nothing seems unusual about these statements. The men of the Hanford Third Branch, however, are those who hold their services in the California state prison at Avenal. Every week, and sometimes multiple times a week, President Ralph Morrill would faithfully visit the brethren of the Hanford Third Branch. Most of society consider these men to be without hope, but not President Morrill. He inspired these men to write mission statements and to have hope for the future. He visited my brother, David, in what would be his darkest hour--the day David learned that his meek and gentle teenage son had lost his life in a senseless act of violence.<br><br>Because of President Morrill's service, my brother, David, has transformed his life. Since David was released from prison almost three years ago, he has helped bring many of his friends to the gospel of Jesus Christ. He has earned four semesters of 4.0 grades and will graduate from the local community college this spring. I will be there to celebrate his graduation, and so will President Morrill.<br><br>President Morrill has invited many men of the Hanford Third Branch to devote their lives to preparing to enter the house of the Lord, where "the power of godliness is manifest."<sup>22</sup><br><br>I believe that President Morrill has attained the attribute of godliness, which involves the capacity to see the divine potential in others and an unfailing dedication to helping them to achieve that potential.<br><h3><b><i>Brotherly Kindness</i></b></h3><br>Add unto godliness brotherly kindness. I remember a story told by Jon Huntsman Sr. about a visit he made to President Howard W. Hunter one day. The story greatly impressed me.<br><br>Brother Huntsman decided to visit President Hunter and found him to be sick. President Hunter said that he was feeling terrible pain in his body, and he asked Brother Huntsman to give him a blessing. Brother Huntsman then asked President Hunter what he thought was causing his illness. President Hunter told him that he had had an unkind thought about another man and it made him physically sick all day.<sup>23</sup><br><br>When I first heard that story, I thought, "There is no hope for me!" However, whenever I am tempted to treat another unkindly, I try to remember President Hunter's example of brotherly kindness.<br><h3><b><i>Charity</i></b></h3><br>Add unto brotherly kindness charity. When I was a young boy, my Grandfather Ignacio gave my brother, David, and me a used bicycle as a gift. We quickly thanked him and sped off to give the gift a test ride. When we returned from our ride, my mother asked us to go to a nearby phone booth and telephone our grandfather to thank him for the bike.<br><br>We arrived at the booth and waited several minutes to make the call. Realizing that the woman using the phone would not leave anytime soon, we decided that it would be best to go to another pay telephone. As we got on the bike to leave, a police officer arrived in his patrol car. The woman who had delayed us immediately left the booth and protested loudly and emphatically, "That is my child's bicycle. It was stolen several months ago."<br><br>The police officer asked where we had gotten the bicycle, and we answered that we had just received it as a gift from our grandfather. The officer loaded us and the bicycle into the patrol car and took us home, where he asked that my mother produce some proof of purchase for the bike. After my mother called my grandfather from a neighbor's phone, my grandfather arrived and presented a receipt for the bike's purchase. The receipt showed that he had purchased the bike that very morning at the police station auction, where unclaimed and recovered property was sold.<br><br>The officer had a dilemma to resolve. Give the bike to the pleading mother or give the bike to us, the recent purchasers. I am sure you have come to your own conclusions based on what you perceive to have been the fairest course of action.<br><br>The officer returned the bicycle to the woman who had claimed it to be rightfully her child's. Of course my brother and I were devastated. At the time I felt it was a serious injustice for the officer to have taken the bicycle and given it to this stranger. As time passed, my legal education here at the BYU Law School only reinforced my feelings about our loss.<br><br>After law school I returned to work in the city where this bike episode had occurred, and I became one of its city attorneys. Ironically, I remember analyzing and applying the very law that should have prevented the officer from taking my first bike had the law been applied correctly.<br><br>It is only in more recent years that I have come to understand the lasting lesson that my grandfather taught me on that day--one that lives longer in my heart than the bicycle ever could. In my mind's eye I have come to understand that he must have seen something in that mother's face, a tired yearning for compassion, that caused him to allow the bicycle to be returned to its rightful owner.<br><br>That day my grandfather taught me a higher law, the second great commandment: how to love your neighbor. My grandfather demonstrated and exercised the gift of charity for another human being.<br><br><i>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</i><sup>24</sup><br><h2><b>Loving the Lord</b></h2><br>The first great commandment requires that we love God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength. Let me share a short video that shows how my brothers and sisters in the Central Valley of California demonstrated that love by pruning vines on Christmas Day in the Lord's vineyard.<sup>25</sup> [A video clip was shown.]<br><br>In this instance, members from the Madera Spanish Ward gave up their Christmas because of their love for the Savior, and I am inspired by their devotion to Him.<br><h2><b>Faith, Hope, and Charity</b></h2><br>The continuum begins with faith and ends with charity, or the pure love of Christ. Charity requires that we love the Savior and all people through the development and mastery of His attributes. Please note that mastery of each of the attributes on the continuum is dependent on our understanding and application of the principle of hope. We must have hope and believe that through Christ we can be more virtuous, knowledgeable, temperate, patient, godly, and kind.<br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He lives and that He loves us. May we do all within our power to become His devoted disciples is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Carl Hernandez III was an associate teaching professor in the BYU J.

<h1>d Looketh on the Heart” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As an anatomy and neuroscience teacher, I have the great privilege to study and teach about one of God's greatest creations: the human body. I marvel every time I listen to a beating heart or watch an electrocardiogram measure a heart's electrical activity. It is remarkable to me to watch skin slowly repair itself following a scratch or to think about where and how memories are stored in the brain.<br><br>When I was a graduate student, one of my research projects was to study the proteins involved in cell division. I would often watch a set of recently fertilized frog eggs split from a single cell into two, then into four, and then into eight. It all happened before my eyes, in a dish, and without the need for a microscope. It was beautiful to watch!<br><br>Life truly is a miracle. I feel the Spirit often as I learn and teach about the human body. As I discover more about how the body works, I see the hand of God more clearly in its workings.<br><br>Consider, for example, the beauty and complexity of the human heart. The heart beats on average seventy-five times each minute, 100,000 times each day, 40 million times each year. It tirelessly beats every second of every hour of every day that we live. The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, pumping every day roughly 2,000 gallons of blood through the 60,000 miles of blood vessels in the body. The heart's valves open and close with perfect timing to ensure that blood moves the correct direction through the various heart chambers and blood vessels. The heart is a marvelous creation!<br><br>In addition to our physical heart, each of us has a spiritual heart. Just as a reliable physical heart is needed to provide nourishment to our physical bodies, a reliable spiritual heart is needed to provide nourishment to our spirits. Our spiritual heart draws us closer to our Heavenly Father. It prompts us to serve and to love each other as family members, friends, and neighbors. It burns with faith and testimony, protects against sin, and gives strength and hope in times of trial.<br><br>It is the importance of our spiritual hearts that I wish to discuss today.<br><br>In the Old Testament, following the spiritual fall of King Saul, Samuel the prophet was led to the house of Jesse in his search for Israel's new king. As he looked over each of Jesse's sons, the Lord taught Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; . . . for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).<br><br>Young David, although not as physically impressive or accomplished as his older brothers, was chosen by the Lord to be king because of the state of his heart. The scriptures explain that David had "a beautiful countenance" and that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon [him]" (1 Samuel 16:12, 13).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we read of a great missionary named Ammon. As Ammon taught the Lamanite king Lamoni about the nature and character of God, he explained that God "looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Alma 18:32).<br><br>I have come to know that this is true. God, our Heavenly Father, knows what is in our hearts. He knows our thoughts, feelings, and desires. He understands our struggles and our strivings.<br><br>Because Heavenly Father knows my heart and He knows your heart, it is beneficial for each of us to take a close, honest look at our hearts. How is your heart doing? Spiritually speaking, is it beating regularly or is it skipping beats? Is it beating strongly or is it weak and thready?<br><br>What can we do to strengthen our spiritual hearts? I would like to propose five questions for each of us to consider as we assess the health of our spiritual hearts.<br><h2><b>A Pure Heart</b></h2><br>First, we can ask ourselves, "Is my heart pure?"<br><br>In Psalms we read:<br><br><i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?</i><br><br><i>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart.</i> [Psalm 24:3–4]<br><br>It is not easy to keep our hands clean and our hearts pure. The sins of the world are numerous and ever present. It takes vigilance. It takes foresight. It takes courage.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught:<br><br><i>Consider the tragic example of King David. Though a spiritual giant in Israel, he allowed himself to look upon something he should not have viewed (see 2 Samuel 11). Tempted by what he saw, he violated two of the Ten Commandments, beginning with "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14). In this way a prophet-king fell from his exaltation (see D&amp;amp;C 132:39).</i><br><br>Elder Oaks continued:<br><br><i>Do all that you can to avoid pornography. If you ever find yourself in its presence--which can happen to anyone in the world in which we live--follow the example of Joseph of Egypt. When temptation caught him in her grip, he left temptation and "got him out" (Genesis 39:12).</i> ["Pornography," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2005]<br><br>There are countless blessings promised to those who keep their hearts pure. In Doctrine and Covenants 121 we are taught:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>Modern-day prophets further explain:<br><br><i>When you are sexually pure, you prepare yourself to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple. You prepare yourself to build a strong marriage and to bring children into the world as part of an eternal and loving family. . . . Remaining sexually pure helps you to be confident and truly happy and improves your ability to make good decisions now and in the future.</i> [<i>For the Strength of Youth</i> (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2011), 35]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, is your heart pure? Sexual sin, including the sin of pornography, quickly leads to spiritual "heart failure." If needed, please repent and become pure. There is no feeling as deeply satisfying as the feeling that comes with complete and honest repentance.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon Alma the Younger taught his sons this truth as he testified of the power of repentance. Speaking of the pains of sin and the joys that accompany repentance, he recalled:<br><br><i>I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i> [Alma 36:21]<br><h2><b>A Soft Heart</b></h2><br>A second question to ask ourselves during our heart checkup could be "Is my heart soft?"<br><br>King Benjamin, one of the great prophet-kings of the Book of Mormon, taught his people to "becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him" (Mosiah 3:19). In essence, he emphasized the importance of having a soft heart.<br><br>The Book of Mormon provides countless examples of the blessings that accompany having a soft heart and the negative consequences that result from hard-heartedness. We can learn much from the differences between Nephi's soft heart and Laman's and Lemuel's hard hearts.<br><br>When the Lord asked Lehi to take his family and leave Jerusalem to go into the wilderness, the hard-hearted Laman and Lemuel complained against their father, saying he had led them out of Jerusalem "because of the foolish imaginations of his heart" (1 Nephi 2:11). Nephi's response was to pray and ask the Lord what <i>His</i> will was.<br><br><i>I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</i> [1 Nephi 2:16]<br><br>A beloved Primary song reminds us of another example that shows the condition of Nephi's heart:<br><br><i>The Lord commanded Nephi to go and build a boat.</i><br><i>Nephi's older brothers believed it would not float.</i><br><i>Laughing and mocking, they said he should not try.</i><br><i>Nephi was courageous. This was his reply:</i><br><br><i> "I will go; I will do the thing the Lord commands.</i><br><i>I know the Lord provides a way; he wants me to obey."</i><br>["Nephi's Courage," <i>Children's Songbook,</i> 120]<br><br>Nephi was submissive, meek, humble, and patient. He was willing to submit to all things the Lord saw fit to inflict upon him. He had a soft heart. Because of this the Lord praised and greatly blessed Nephi: "The Lord spake unto [Nephi], saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart" (1 Nephi 2:19).<br><br>One measure of the softness of our heart is to look at the extent to which we obey BYU's honor code. Soft-hearted individuals are willing to submit themselves to all aspects of the Honor Code--even those portions that they do not agree with or understand. Those who choose to reject portions of an honor code that they previously agreed to observe might be demonstrating symptoms of a hard heart.<br><br>The Lord will bless each of us as we keep our hearts soft. He will strengthen us as we choose to be meek, humble, patient, and full of love. He will lead us and guide us as we show our willingness to submit to the will and timing of the Lord in all things.<br><h2><b>A Grateful Heart</b></h2><br>Next, as we evaluate our hearts, we can ask ourselves, "Do I have a grateful heart?"<br><br>Joseph Smith, in summarizing the very essence of our faith, taught, "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, <i>we seek after these things</i>" (Articles of Faith 1:13; emphasis added). It is easier to feel the Spirit of the Lord, easier to feel close to our Heavenly Father, easier to want to be good, and easier to be happy when we look for the good in life and nurture thoughts and feelings of gratitude.<br><br>I am grateful for President Gordon B. Hinckley's example of finding the good and his encouragement for us to do the same. He said:<br><br><i>I</i> [ask] <i>that we stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight. I am suggesting that as we go through life we "accentuate the positive." I</i> [ask] <i>that we look a little deeper for the good.</i> ["Words of the Prophet: The Spirit of Optimism," <i>New Era,</i> July 2001]<br><br>During the fall of 1992 I was an undergraduate student at BYU. I had been married to my wife, Daphne, for a little over a year when we learned she was expecting our first child. I was going to school year-round, slowly working through the challenging course work required of a major in microbiology. Life as a student was difficult. There was never enough time and never enough money. I am sure that many of you can relate. Thanksgiving rolled around, and Daphne and I were excited to have a short break. We decided to leave town and travel to Fruitland, New Mexico, to visit Daphne's sister Laurie and her family.<br><br>During the drive down my mouth watered at the thought of having a full-blown Thanksgiving dinner with turkey, stuffing, potatoes, candied yams, freshly baked rolls, and homemade pies! To top it off, the sister we were visiting was an excellent cook. At the time of our visit, she was also very pregnant with her sixth child and due any day.<br><br>On Thanksgiving day Laurie's baby decided it was time to enter the world. I spent all day watching Laurie labor at home. I helped count the time between her contractions, and my wife and I did what we could to assist her and her family. When she was whisked away to the hospital by her husband to deliver the baby, I knew that my hope of having a good Thanksgiving dinner was gone. With little time to make dinner, those of us still at home pulled out the grill and made French toast.<br><br>Feeling sorry for myself, I hopped in my car and drove for twenty minutes through the barren New Mexico landscape to the nearest town that was large enough to have restaurants. I was determined to eat something good on Thanksgiving. Upon entering town it quickly became apparent that none of the restaurants were open. Every single one was closed. I drove back and forth through town looking for any place that could feed such a desperate soul. The only place I found open was an Arby's fast-food restaurant. As I walked into Arby's I realized that it was completely empty. The only people present were the workers, and they looked at me as if to say, "Poor you--all alone and no place to go for Thanksgiving."<br><br>During the drive back to Laurie's house I continued to feel sorry for myself. I had no money. I had no time. I had no hope of graduating quickly. I was driving through the New Mexico desert alone. And I had had a lousy Thanksgiving dinner.<br><br>As I turned the car around a bend to the south, I suddenly became aware that the colors of the landscape were changing because the sun was setting. What I previously saw as a barren desert I began to see as a land filled with beautiful buttes, bluffs, and valleys. Suddenly and unexpectedly I became filled and overwhelmed with the spirit of gratitude. The Spirit washed through and over my soul like a warm blanket. The Holy Ghost witnessed to me how incredibly blessed I really was. I felt Him so intensely that I nearly had to stop the car. On that lonely New Mexico highway I felt more powerfully than I had ever previously felt the Lord's mercy, awareness, and love.<br><br>As I look back on this experience, I am embarrassed by my previous self-pity. I didn't deserve the incredible spiritual feelings that I felt on that day, yet the Lord in His mercy saw fit to fill me with His love, light, and understanding.<br><br>On that day I learned to "stop seeking out the storms and enjoy more fully the sunlight." I learned to accentuate the positive and look more deeply for the good. I learned the importance of having a grateful heart in any circumstance.<br><h2><b>An Obedient Heart</b></h2><br>Another question to ask as we appraise our hearts is "Do I have an obedient heart?"<br><br>After graduating from BYU I entered graduate school to study neuroscience. The first few years of graduate school were difficult. I worked very hard in the research lab but had little to show for it. Results of lab experiments were inconsistent and progress was slow. Because graduating was dependent on research productivity, I was worried that I might never graduate. What was even more discouraging was the job outlook at the time. Getting a job in my field was highly competitive, and many graduating PhDs couldn't find jobs.<br><br>A few years into my graduate program I attended an international scientific conference in San Francisco. Several thousand cell biologists had gathered to share their research results and methods. I hoped to network with these scientists and gather ideas and techniques to help me in my own research.<br><br>One evening, after a long day at the conference, my wife and I were relaxing in an open area of our hotel. To my surprise, seated a few feet away was one of my favorite BYU professors. Several years previously I had taken two classes from him. I loved this particular professor not only because he had been an excellent teacher of microbiology but because I had felt the Spirit strongly in his classes. There in the hotel I reached out to him, not expecting him to remember or recognize me.<br><br>Also to my surprise, he not only recognized me but knew exactly which seat I had sat in when I had been his student. I had always sat in the very back corner of the classroom. After introducing my wife and updating him about our family, I began to share my concerns about the slow progress of my research and the nonexistent job market. With great anxiety in my voice, I asked him for advice.<br><br>He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, "Mike, the best way to prepare for your future is to live by your covenants."<br><br>As he said those words I experienced a great moment of clarity. He was right! The best way to prepare for my future was to live by my covenants. Daphne and I had a great feeling of peace. We were living our covenants. We were striving to be obedient in every way we knew how. We were trying our best to be a loving husband or wife. We were striving to be the best parents we could be to our four young children. We were serving diligently in our church callings. We were keeping the commandments, attending the temple, and living the gospel. We knew we could count on the Lord's blessings.<br><br>Since that enlightening day in San Francisco, I have often reflected on my BYU professor's counsel. My journal is filled with experiences and blessings that are directly linked to my wife's and my obedience to the covenants we have made with the Lord.<br><br>One of the major lessons of the Book of Mormon is summarized by the Lord in the following way: "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence" (2 Nephi 1:20).<br><br>I offer you the same advice I received but with my own witness: The best way to prepare for <i>your</i> future is to live by your covenants! The Lord promises to support, guide, and direct those who follow Him. An obedient heart tethers our will to the Lord's and allows us to draw upon the powers of heaven as we walk through life.<br><h2><b>Of One Heart</b></h2><br>A final question to raise as we consider our hearts is "Are we as individuals, families, and neighbors of <i>one</i> heart?"<br><br>When the prophet Enoch lived on the earth, "the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind" (Moses 7:18).<br><br>Remember what happened in the Americas following the Savior's visit:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i><br><br><i>There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in <b>one,</b> the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.</i> [4 Nephi 1:15–17; emphasis added]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are a blessed people. It is a wonderful privilege to have the Light of Christ and the restored gospel in our lives. Are we seeking to live with one heart in our marriages and families, with our roommates, or with ward members? Or do we allow contention to be in our hearts? Do we seek to serve others while tempering our own needs and wants? Remember, selfishness has no place in a Zion-like people.<br><br>President Hinckley taught:<br><br><i>If we are to build that Zion of which the prophets have spoken and of which the Lord has given mighty promise, we must set aside our consuming selfishness. We must rise above our love for comfort and ease, and in the very process of effort and struggle, even in our extremity, we shall become better acquainted with our God.</i> ["Our Mission of Saving," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1991]<br><br>As we strive to be Saints of God and choose to follow our Savior Jesus Christ, let us reach out in love and service to one another. May we notice and nurture the good in each other. As we do so, we will become of one heart.<br><h2><b>An Honest Assessment</b></h2><br>Let us review the central questions to ask ourselves as we perform an honest assessment of our hearts:<br><br>• Is my heart pure?<br>• Is my heart soft?<br>• Do I have a grateful heart?<br>• Do I have an obedient heart?<br>• Are we of one heart?<br><br>As we consider the answers to these questions, the Lord will prompt each of us through His Spirit. We will recognize more fully and more completely our talents and strengths. We may be prompted to make specific changes. Submissively making these changes will bring us closer to the Lord.<br><br>I testify of the importance and power of the Lord's Atonement and of His ability to change hearts. I am grateful for His love, patience, and mercy. I love Him and know He is my Savior. With all my heart I desire to do His will and to be more like Him.<br><br>As the Lord looks on each of our hearts, I pray that He will be pleased with what He sees. I pray that He will pour out His blessings upon us as we strive to become more like Him in thought, word, and deed. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael D.

<h1>r&#039;s Continuing Influence - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is a magnificent building constructed to further the study of the life sciences. The size and function of the building show how far BYU has come in this academic area.<br><br>What is now the College of Life Sciences first became a separate college at BYU in 1954 with the formation of the College of Biological and Agricultural Sciences. The first dean of the college was Clarence Cottam, who served as dean for only one year before accepting a position at a wildlife refuge in Texas.<sup>1</sup> It is clear that Cottam left, in part, because his expectations for the new college were not being met. At the time of his departure, Cottam told President Ernest L. Wilkinson, "I would be less than honest if I did not express the personal view that I know of no university that is doing less with its opportunities in agriculture and biology."<sup>2</sup> That is hardly a vote of confidence in the future of the college.<br><br>Now look where we are. There are ­currentlyseven academic departments in the ­college covering a wide array of life sciences disciplines, and there are several centers--including one dedicated to the study of DNA sequencing and neuroscience--for disciplines that Brother Cottam likely never imagined. And, most of all, we have this wonderful ­facility designed with laboratory space and meeting areas that allow both faculty and students to engage in cutting-edge research. This building is a tangible and very large reminder that we really have come a long way in life ­sciences in the last fifty years.<br><br>But the building is only a structure with ­little to contribute, by itself, to the advancement of the purposes of BYU. The type of building that houses the College of Life Sciences is not nearly as important as the type of people who teach and study there.<br><br>With that in mind, let me share just a few thoughts about the person who really launched the endeavor that has become the College of Life Sciences--the person whose name was on the building that this building will replace: John A. Widtsoe.<br><br>Born in Norway in 1872, Widtsoe came to the United States at the age of eleven with his widowed mother--his father having passed away when he was six years old.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Widtsoe had a world-class intellect. He graduated from Harvard in only three years<sup>4</sup> with a degree in chemistry<sup>5</sup> and a passion for applying that science to improve agriculture. He then went to Europe for his graduate degree, obtaining his PhD from a prominent university in Germany. After a stint at what is now Utah State University, Widtsoe finally responded positively to the repeated entreaties of President George H. Brimhall and came to BYU in 1905,<sup>6</sup> becoming the first PhD-prepared professor at this institution.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Widtsoe spent only two years at BYU, but his impact was tremendous. During his two-year tenure at BYU, he traveled the state "instructing farmers and recruiting students."<sup>8</sup> Working with his wife, Leah, who had earlier "founded the school's domestic science program,"<sup>9</sup> Widtsoe established "the first agricultural class for women in the West."<sup>10</sup> "[President] Brimhall reported that Widtsoe's department was 'having a wonderful educational influence in favor of our Church systems.'"<sup>11</sup> As former president Rex E. Lee once observed, "Our first academic endeavor that attracted any attention beyond Utah County was in agriculture, under the leadership of John A. Widtsoe."<sup>12</sup><br><br>When Widtsoe left the university in 1907 to become president of Utah State (or the Agricultural College of Utah, as it was then known), many assumed his influence--and the agricultural department he founded--would quickly fade away. Amos N. Merrill, who succeeded Widtsoe as head of the Agriculture Department, "reported that the department was not very popular" once Widtsoe had left, citing as evidence "the fact that on the first day of registration, not a single [person] came to me to be registered."<sup>13</sup><br><br>But both the department and its founder's influence on BYU would increase over the years. After serving as president of Utah State and later the University of Utah, Widtsoe was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1921.<sup>14</sup> At that time he began the first of two terms as the commissioner of Church Education.<sup>15</sup> From that position he continued to guide and shape the destiny of this university.<br><br>During his life John A. Widtsoe did as much as any contemporary to establish the link between science and the gospel. With unparalleled spiritual and intellectual prowess and energy, he sought to erase the artificial distinction between scientific and religious truth. For him, the two were inextricably united. "As a soil chemist," Truman G. Madsen related, "John A. Widtsoe [once reported] a laborious struggle trying to draw a mountain of data together and make it applicable. It did not work. [Discouraged,] he finally called his wife [and said,] 'Let's go to the temple and forget the failure.' In the temple it [all] came. That resulted in two books and in a revolution in agrarian practice."<sup>16</sup> Widtsoe not only believed but demonstrated that learning can occur "by study and also by faith,"<sup>17</sup> a proposition to which this university is completely committed.<br><br>Just as Elder Widtsoe had a revelatory scientific experience in the temple, we can, with the right spirit and approach, have a revelatory spiritual experience in this new Life Sciences Building if--as we are directed in Doctrine and Covenants 88:67--our eye is single to the glory of God.<br><br>John A. Widtsoe would no doubt be pleased with this remarkable new facility. But he would also remind us that, in the long run, what happens here and the attitude and spirit of those who study and labor here will be the most important factors in its future.<br><br>In 1930 Elder Widtsoe shared his prophetic vision of and confidence in the future of this great institution. He stated:<br><br><i>BYU has a great mission in these latter days. I have little fear about its future. The rumblings may always continue, but sooner or later the institution will be so firmly established that even an earthquake cannot undo it.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>This new Life Sciences Building is seismically much stronger and sounder than the Widtsoe Building it replaces. The spirit with which the faculty and students engage in their work can make it spiritually much stronger and more solid. May we work successfully to that end is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of BYU when this address was given at the dedication of the Life Sciences Building on 9 April 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>d Reason: The Appropriation of Knowledge and Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish to express my gratitude to the trustees, administration, faculty, and students of Brigham Young University for the invitation to be with you for this great celebration of the academic achievements of the men and women who are graduating today. I also want to thank you for the tremendous honor that you are conferring on me. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the graduates and to the families whose love and support enabled these men and women to achieve what they have achieved in these years of study. Finally, I just want to say what a tremendous honor it is for me to be receiving this degree along with President Cecil O. Samuelson, whose distinguished leadership of this university I admire and whose contributions to intellectual life and to human values beyond Brigham Young University are so exemplary.<br><br>There are traditions of thought that propose a radical separation of faith and reason. They ask, "What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?" Although notable Christians from Tertullian to Kierkegaard have associated themselves with such traditions, they have not gained ascendancy in the larger Christian community. The mainstream of Christianity, while fully cognizant of what theologians describe as "the noetic effects of sin"--that is, the way in which our fallenness not only weakens the human will but also darkens the intellect--proclaims the harmony of faith and reason and the need for faith to seek and be informed by understanding.<br><br>In the words of Pope John Paul II, the philosophy professor who became pope and who has now been canonized as a saint, "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth."1<br><br>The two wings are not separate paths to truth. Just as both wings are necessary and must be in working order for the dove or the eagle to fly, so too both faith and reason are necessary for the intellectual and spiritual quest and for the intellectual and spiritual life. And faith and reason do not work separately or independently of one another, but rather they work together, in harmony. Faith and reason mutually entail and require each other. Neither can truly exist--faith cannot truly be faith, reason cannot truly be reason--wholly apart from one another.<br><br>This helps to explain why Christianity has built not only majestic cathedrals in which to worship but also great universities in which to study and learn. The very idea of a university is religious and, indeed, Christian in its inspiration, conception, and fundamental content. The greatest modern reflection on the idea of a university--what a university is, what it does, why it does it, how it should do it--is the work of an eminent Christian thinker, John Henry Cardinal Newman, the great nineteenth-century British man of letters.2<br><br>And today more than ever we need universities that are true to Newman's vision, universities in which faith and reason work in harmony, accomplishing what could never be accomplished by faith or reason apart from one another.<br><br>It is commonly said that universities exist for three purposes: the creation of knowledge, the preservation of knowledge, and the transmission of knowledge. This is certainly true. Across the range of disciplines in the arts, sciences, and professional fields, universities should be pursuing these important goals. But there is an additional purpose, and that is what I call the <i>appropriation</i> of knowledge. It is in respect of this goal that the significance of faith in the cause of learning becomes clearest.<br><br>Our aim as scholars and students must be not merely to acquire knowledge but also to explore, as deeply as possible, its larger, lasting, and even cosmic significance. We, my fellow faculty members, and our students must aspire not merely to know the truth about this or that or the other object of inquiry but must aspire to grasp its meaning. When we speak, as we rightly do, of viewing or understanding something "in the light of faith," it is the existential meaning and moral and spiritual significance of our knowing that we are describing or pointing to. I am here echoing a very important point that Ryan made for you just a few moments ago. It is exactly what I mean by the appropriation of knowledge. And the true appropriation of knowledge is possible only against the horizon (or, as we might say, "in the light") of faith.<br><br>For this crucial reason, though it is not the only reason, Mormon or Catholic or Protestant or Jewish or Muslim colleges and universities must be more than simply secular universities with some religious symbols in the classrooms or prayers before classes and other events or lots of religious activities on campus. Faith must play a key role <i>in the intellectual life</i> of the college or university. Faith must inform the curriculum and help to shape the questions we explore in our courses and in our scholarly research.<br><br>A pitfall that I think is simply critical to avoid is the aspiration of a religious university to be "the Mormon Harvard" or "the Catholic Princeton," at least where that aspiration entails mimicking the professional norms, standards, practices, and goals of universities that have opted for a more or less thoroughgoing secularism. Especially in areas of the humanities and social sciences--in which matters of human deliberation, judgment, choice, and action are grist for the intellectual mill--the questions raised and the modes of inquiry and analysis employed should never slavishly imitate what is going on in leading secular institutions. The consequence of such mimicry will be--you can count on it--the abandonment of that part of the mission of the university that concerns what I have called the appropriation of truth. The putatively value-free, purely external examination or description of facts will become the leading object of scholarly pursuit--and will soon come to be regarded as the <i>only</i> valid object of scholarly pursuit--with the assessment of their meaning and moral and spiritual significance pushed to the margins as if these matters were outside the scope of rational inquiry and therefore beyond the bounds of legitimate scholarly labor.<br><br>When faith becomes irrelevant to the intellectual mission of religiously affiliated academic institutions--when the fundamental standards by which scholars judge themselves and their institutions are the so-called professional standards of the secular intellectual culture, detached from the spiritual mission of the church with which the university is affiliated--religion will soon come to be perceived as, at best, an extracurricular campus pursuit and, at worst, an obscurantist intrusion into the house of intellect. In the latter case, religious authorities will come to be perceived as having no legitimate role in the governance of the institution and will be resented if they so much as raise questions about curricular matters or the research agendas of members of the faculty.<br><br>Now, my friends, what I am describing here is no mere theoretical possibility. It has happened. And it has happened to many colleges and universities that were once religiously affiliated and to more than a few that continue to have at least nominal religious affiliation, whether Catholic or Protestant. The sad story is told brilliantly, and at length, in the book <i>The Dying of the Light,</i>3 written by the late Father James Burtchaell, who was provost of the University of Notre Dame. But for those universities that have remained faithful, including this distinguished institution, secularization is by no means inevitable. Nor is it the case that a decision to resist secularization inevitably undermines the capacity of such institutions to command respect in the larger intellectual culture. A Brigham Young University or a University of Notre Dame need not choose between religious fidelity and the respect of peer institutions, and they certainly need not choose between fidelity to their religious mission and academic excellence.<br><br>The deeper questions of meaning and significance cannot permanently be laid aside, even in secular institutions. People can try to sideline those questions, but the questions will keep coming back. Human nature itself will see to it that that happens. We human beings long for the truth and desire its full appropriation. We cannot permanently be satisfied with conceptions of intellectual life and inquiry that place the deepest questions out of bounds or off limits. Already one perceives--not just in the humanities but also in the social sciences and even in the natural sciences--a sense of lack, even a bit of a guilty conscience, for the marginalization of questions of meaning and moral and spiritual significance. Perhaps without being fully conscious of it, some in secular colleges and universities have a sense that their institutions need to be a bit more like Brigham Young University. So this is no time for faith-based colleges and universities to be sloughing off what makes them not only different but, in an important respect, superior.<br><br>Excellence is the aspiration and rallying cry of all universities. It will be proclaimed at commencement ceremonies across the land from now through June. But there are of course competing conceptions of excellence and different understandings of the standards of excellence--of what is to count as excellence. The excellence of BYU consists in no small part in its devotion to the appropriation of truth--its dedication to exploring the larger, lasting, and even eternal meaning and significance of what we know or can discover. This dedication is itself the fruit of rootedness in a great tradition of faith; of guidance from wise and devoted trustees; of the intellectual and pedagogical gifts of a distinguished and faithful faculty; and, of course, of the extraordinary generosity of faithful Latter-day Saint families who are moved by love of God and neighbor to support an institution of higher learning dedicated to the integration of faith and reason.<br><br>My friends, my prayer for you--for you, President Worthen, for the trustees, for the faculty, for BYU's graduates, and for the many students to come--is that by the grace of God and with His abundant blessings you will always remain faithful to your mission in all of its dimensions. Pursue the truth, preserve the truth, transmit the truth, and appropriate the truth more and more deeply.<br><br>For me, it is an exceptionally high honor to be joining the ranks of the honorary alumni of this institution. Thank you all, and may God richly, richly bless you.<br><br><i>Robert P. George, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University, director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions, and visiting professor at Harvard Law School, received an honorary doctorate when this BYU commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ons to the Past - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The program now calls for greetings by the president. Just what is really expected, however, is far from clear. One experienced president gave this sage advice to a new president about the role he should play at a commencement. "Think of yourself as the body at an Irish wake," he said. "Your presence is necessary in order to have the party, but no one really expects you to say too much." With that in mind, I would like to provide just a bit of context for today's event.<br><br>The first graduation from this institution came at a time before it was a university. Brigham Young Academy, as it was then known, was formally established in 1875. For its first three decades it was more a combination grammar and secondary school than a university. At the end of the school's first year, in 1876, the record indicates that "none of [the] students [had] advanced beyond the fifth reader level of grammar school,"<sup>1</sup> so no one graduated. The first group to graduate from the Academy came a year later in June 1877, when two women and one man received diplomas recognizing their completion of the teacher preparation program.<sup>2</sup> There is no record that any formal ceremony was held.<br><br>The first "collegiate diploma" was given four years later in 1881 to an exceptional student who had graduated from the high school a year earlier; his name was James E. Talmage.<sup>3</sup> Talmage was so bright and accomplished that, for a short period of time, he was both a student and a teacher at the school.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Things have changed a bit since that time. We no longer check to see if any of our students have gone beyond the fifth reader level of grammar school before we schedule a graduation ceremony, and no high school diplomas are given out. Moreover, we honor a lot more than three students. Today we will recognize more than 5,000 students who will receive bachelor's degrees, nearly 700 who will receive master's degrees, and 185 who will receive doctoral degrees. We have come a long way since those early years.<br><br>At the same time, we are more closely linked to the seemingly distant past than we may realize. As I mentioned, the first person to receive a collegiate degree from what is now BYU was James E. Talmage, who went on to become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The oldest graduating student this year (who is seventy years old and who I congratulate today), was born more than a decade after Elder Talmage died in 1933. So I am certain that none of our graduates here today ever met the first recipient of a BYU college degree. Yet there is a direct connection between Elder Talmage and many of today's graduates.<br><br>During his time as an educator, Elder Talmage personally mentored a bright young student named J. Reuben Clark Jr. As most of you know, J. Reuben Clark Jr. eventually became a member of the First Presidency of the Church. President Clark credited much of his success in life to the mentoring he received from Elder Talmage.<sup>5</sup> Recognizing the profound impact such mentoring had had on him, President Clark reached out to bright young people in his sphere of influence to personally mentor them. Among that select group was Harold B. Lee, a future president of the Church. Following the same pattern, President Lee personally mentored a brilliant scholar and young Church leader named Neal A. Maxwell, another future member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Elder Maxwell in turn personally mentored a number of those whom he identified as potential leaders in the kingdom, including an incredibly bright young medical scholar named Cecil O. Samuelson, who I am confident has had a personal impact on many of the graduates here today and who I know has had a profound influence on me.<br><br>From Talmage to Clark to Lee to Maxwell to Samuelson and then to you and me--five direct links and we are back to the beginning of this institution, connected to the very first person to have received a college diploma from BYU.<br><br>But the connection to the past goes beyond mere mentoring genealogy. While many things have changed since the days when James E. Talmage was a student here, the core purpose and focus of this institution have remained the same. During his second year at the Academy, when he was just fifteen years old, Talmage enrolled in the newly formed Normal Department, organized to prepare teachers.<sup>6</sup> Talmage kept notes of the lectures given to the department that year by Karl G. Maeser. A line from the notes of the first lecture states:<br><br><i>Education boasts of having the highest . . . aim of any avocation in life. The whole range has but one object and purpose, which is to bring us nearer the platform of our God. This object was set forth and pointed out by Christ himself: "Be ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect." This should be a teacher's watchword.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>That same aim--"to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life"<sup>8</sup>--remains the principal purpose of this university today, as the first line of our mission statement makes clear. It is a quest that will continue long after you leave this university, and indeed long after you have left this mortal existence. But it is the most important quest in which you will engage. May your education here and your use of that education to serve others in the future be productively employed to that end is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One of my privileges as alumni president is to officially welcome all of you into the BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. Welcome to this great association of more than 407,000 living alumni.<br><p>As you know, the mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> [Provo: BYU, 2014], 1). This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn't end, the quest doesn't end, and our relationships don't end. Our mission is to extend the BYU experience beyond graduation and to build lifelong relationships with alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you learned while you were here. We hope you will stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.<br><p>Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Do that through our BYU Alumni RISE campaign. Through that campaign we have collected the stories of more than 3,000 of our former students. We have heard from a mother and a father whose greatest joy is having each of their eight children attend BYU. We have heard from a scientist who uses a specialized machine to extract DNA in forensics cases in a way that has never before been possible. We have heard from an alum who initially struggled but who used the business principles he learned here at BYU to launch a lucrative business. We would love to hear your stories. We invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.<br><p>I would like to leave you with one final thought. Some of you may have seen the musical <i>The Wiz.</i> At the end of the movie, when the Lion realized he had developed courage, the Tin Man had recognized his heart, and the Scarecrow had recognized his brain, Dorothy was disappointed because she didn't know how to get her wish, which was to return to Kansas. It was then that Glinda the Good came to her and sang what is so appropriate for us today: "Believe in yourself as I believe in you." It was then that Dorothy realized that she had the power to return by believing in herself and clicking her red shoes together ("Believe in Yourself," <i>The Wiz</i> [1978]).<br><p>Well, we believe in you, my dear brothers and sisters, and so does our Heavenly Father. I pray that you will follow His counsel for you throughout the eternities because He sees in you the power to become perfect and to dwell with Him eternally. This is my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p><i>Terry R. Seamons was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.</i><br><p><i>&amp;copy; Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i></p><br>

Elder Snow, President Worthen, and fellow graduates, I am grateful and honored to address you today. One hundred and two years ago the student graduation speaker, Alfred Kelly, mounted the podium as I do now and forever changed the course of BYU.<br><br>BYU was in financial difficulties, and plans were in place to sell some of the school property. However, Kelly had a vision. In his vision he literally saw the present-day BYU that we now know.<br><br>As past BYU president Jeffrey R. Holland has told the story, while Alfred Kelly stood on Temple Hill,<br><br><i>everything he saw took on the appearance of people, young people about his age moving toward Temple Hill. He saw hundreds of them, thousands of young people coming into view. He knew they were students, he said, because they carried books in their arms as they came. . . .</i><br><br><i>The students then entered these temples of learning with their books in hand. As they came out of them, Kelly said their countenances bore smiles of hope and of faith. He observed that they seemed cheerful and very confident. Their walk was light but firm.</i><br><br>Alfred Kelly's vision changed the course of BYU with "all believing in the dream of a Provo schoolboy, all believing the destiny of a <i>great</i> university which that day had scarcely begun" (Jeffrey R. Holland, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_god-expects-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who We Are and What God Expects Us to Do</a>," BYU devotional address, 15 September 1987; emphasis in original; see B. F. Larsen, "Fifty Years Ago," speech given at a BYU alumni meeting, 25 May 1962, B. F. Larsen biographical file, BYU Archives, 4–5).<br><br>I believe that we, the graduating class of 2015, are the students that Alfred Kelly saw more than one hundred years ago. What can we do to be the vision? I will discuss three ways in which we can be the students that Kelly envisioned on Temple Hill.<br><br>First, who we are is more important than what we know. Were the students that Kelly saw distinguished by their intelligence, looks, or skills? No. They were distinguished by their character, their hope, their faith, and their cheerfulness. In our future careers and activities, how will we be distinguished?<br><br>The same facts that are taught here at BYU are taught at other schools. Absolute zero is still −273 degrees Celsius here as it is at Harvard. D-Day still is recognized as happening on June 6, 1944, here at BYU as it is at Yale. Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel is still a masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance here as it is at UCLA. If the facts are the same, what is it that makes us unique as BYU students?<br><br>Why did you come to BYU in the first place? Maybe because you wanted to be in a specific program or to be taught by a specific professor. Maybe because your friends came here or maybe because of the opportunity to be with those of similar values and beliefs.<br><br>Whatever the reason, I hope that you now know why you are a BYU Cougar and that you have been changed because of it. I hope that you now know that secular knowledge does not clash with religious knowledge but rather enhances it. To be the vision, we must be distinguished by our character, leadership, charity, kindness, honesty, and integrity. As BYU graduates we have the unique responsibility and opportunity to be lights on a hill in this darkening world.<br><br>Second, seek for and create temples of learning. We have been privileged to attend and study in temples of learning throughout our education. As we graduate, we will no longer have the opportunity to be in these temples of learning that are spread throughout campus. To be the vision, let us take a piece of these temples of learning with us. Wherever we are, whether it be at work or at home, let us make our own temples of learning through our openness to innovation, desire for growth and improvement, and dedication to lifelong learning.<br><br>Third, have a personal vision for your life. Just like Alfred Kelly's vision changed the course of this school, our own personal vision can change the course of our life. This year's women's volleyball team used #WhyNotUs on their remarkable run to the national championship game. Likewise, I would pose the same question: Why not us? Why can't we become the world's most influential engineers and scientists yet also be the most humble? Why can't we become the world's most innovative artists, teachers, and lawyers yet also be the most kind? Why can't we become the world's most successful authors, businessmen, and doctors yet also be the most family oriented? Even if our plans and goals do not pan out exactly how we have envisioned them, we will still benefit from having that vision.<br><br>As we go forth to serve, let us remember our legacy and those who have gone on before us. Kelly's vision of us changed the course of BYU in the past, and now we, the graduating class of 2015, will change the future course of BYU through our influence for good, our drive to innovate and excel, and, above all, our integrity and character in all situations. First, remember that who we are is more important than what we know; second, seek for and create temples of learning; and third, have a personal vision for your life. As we do these things, we will be the vision. Thank you.<br><br><i>Ryan T. Barrett spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 23 April 2015.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

In my current assignment as Historian and Recorder for the Church, I have the privilege of working with some incredibly bright people. The Church History Department is housed in the Church History Library, just east of the LDS Conference Center. In this building are located the archives that house a marvelous collection of documents, books, journals, correspondence, film, and other important artifacts. On the fourth floor is a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory where historical artifacts, documents, books, and even textiles are brought so they might be preserved or restored.<br><br>Let me share by video some of the work that goes on here: Emiline Twitchell is cleaning off old glue from a book spine that has become hard and inflexible. She is working on an early copy of a Welsh Pearl of Great Price. Katie Smith is removing damaging tape (a four-letter word in document conservation) from the first Relief Society Minute Book. She is also washing an early LDS Danish journal to restore it to its near original condition. Here she is sewing back together the original Mayfield, Utah, Relief Society Minute Book.<br><br>In older books the spine often breaks and needs replacing. Here Katie is preparing leather for a replacement spine for a book. This is called rebacking and involves adding new material under the original cover to compensate for the failing spine. Here you see she is working on a first-edition copy of the Book of Mormon that is undergoing this process of adding the leather to reinforce the spine. Finally, here is a finished book in which the spine has been reattached over the new material underneath. In this case the book is another Relief Society record from the nineteenth century.<br><br>Restoration work can be tedious and time consuming, but the results can be stunning. I am so pleased we have professionals who are dedicated to preserving our past by restoring these important elements of our history.<br><br>This is only part of the work of the Church History Department. Besides the library, where most of the precious documents, books, newspapers, and film are stored, the Church has the Church History Museum, where important artifacts are displayed and also stored. The Granite Mountain Records Vault acts as a storage facility for microfilm and digital records. We also have Church history advisors called who serve in their own countries around the world, collecting, preserving, and sharing Church history from their own lands. We work as well with the Missionary Department and other Church entities in the operation and preservation of the historic sites of the Church--from Palmyra, New York, to Martin's Cove, Wyoming, and from Kirtland, Ohio, to the Mormon Battalion Visitors' Center in San Diego, California.<br><br>In the past several years we have made a tremendous effort to provide Church history offerings online so the stories, documents, and journals might be shared with the entire Church without the necessity of coming to Church headquarters to view these treasures.<br><br>When the Church has so many priorities in its mission to bring the gospel to the world, some might ask why it is so important to preserve Church history. I would submit there are two fundamental reasons why we document our history.<br><br>First, it was commanded that "there shall be a record kept among you." Through the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord revealed the importance of keeping a record in the opening lines of Doctrine and Covenants 21:1. This revelation was given the day the Church was organized, and diligent historians since that time have faithfully exercised their duty to keep the history of the Church. This duty was considered so important that early Church historians carefully packed the records into crates and loaded them in covered wagons for the westward trek. When there was scarce room for supplies necessary to build a new life in the wilderness, these crates of records were packed instead of flour or tools. These same records are now housed in the archives of the Church History Library.<br><br>Second, our history is kept to help us remember. We gain strength from the stories of those who have gone before. We all must figuratively pull our own handcart through life. We learn from past generations how to be strong and what brings happiness and joy in our lives. We also learn that God's children are not and never have been perfect and that He can accomplish His work through people just like you and me, even if we have obvious or hidden shortcomings.<br><br>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has said:<br><br><i>Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with. That must be terribly frustrating to Him, but He deals with it. So should we.</i> ["Lord, I Believe," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2013]<br><br>If you were fortunate enough to grow up in homes of faith, you were taught at an early age to pray, to study the scriptures, and to live the commandments. Your parents knew these admonitions were as important to your spiritual growth as other admonitions designed to keep you physically safe.<br><br>The prophets of God, just like parents, constantly exhorted the people of their time to remember. Nephi, speaking of his wicked brothers, said:<br><br><i>I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</i> [1 Nephi 15:25]<br><br>And who does not recall the counsel of Alma to his son:<br><br><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</i> [Alma 37:35]<br><br>Certainly such a plea reflects the desire of every righteous parent.<br><br>After wandering in the wilderness for forty years, the Israelites were finally prepared to enter the promised land. As reported in Joshua, the Lord miraculously parted the waters of the river Jordan so they could pass into Israel on dry ground. Thereafter the people were commanded to take twelve stones and build a monument that could be prominently and perpetually seen. Why? It was so they would remember. In Joshua we read:<br><br><i>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</i><br><br><i>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</i> [Joshua 4:6–7]<br><br>We too place monuments to help us remember. The miracle of the seagulls, the suffering of the handcart pioneers, and the arrival of the Saints in the Salt Lake Valley are all examples of events and miracles remembered with monuments. Even on this campus monuments have been erected to help us remember the sacrifices of those who have gone before. But it is not just monuments we erect. As members of the restored Church we are encouraged to do certain things to help us remember:<br><br>a. We keep journals.<br><br>b. We attend the temple.<br><br>c. We offer prayers of gratitude.<br><br>d. We study our scriptures.<br><br>e. We attend Sunday School, institute, and seminary classes to study the gospel.<br><br>f. We partake of the sacrament.<br><br>Much of what we do as members of the Church helps form and strengthen our testimonies of the gospel. In addition, remembering spiritual experiences that touched our lives reinforces our faith. Learning of the spiritual strengths and sacrifices of others also helps us. Scriptural accounts, stories of ancestors and faithful pioneers, as well as the testimonies of faithful peers reinforce and strengthen our own testimonies of the gospel.<br><br>Today is a day of celebration that will always be a milestone in your lives. Some of you will begin your careers in your chosen field. Others will face board exams, bar exams, internships, or further graduate study. Wherever you are in your life's journey, this is a day you will remember. I am not confident you will remember any of my words, but while I have your attention, I would like to remind you of a few things.<br><br>Remember to be grateful. You have received a wonderful education that is one of the best in higher education, both in its quality and its affordability. Thank your parents, family, and friends who have encouraged you. Many of you have been assisted financially by your loved ones, and all of you have been supported emotionally by them. They deserve your sincere gratitude. Give them a hug and tell them thanks.<br><br>In the future remember Brigham Young University and the Church that supports and underwrites it. When you are able, give generously to BYU and support its activities. Stand on the shoulders of those who have donated to make this institution what it is. You may not be able to have a building named after you, but you can support a scholarship fund to help future generations who are privileged to attend this university.<br><br>Remember the importance of relationships in your lives. You have made friends in your time here. You probably feel that maintaining these friendships over time will be effortless. You are mistaken. As you now scatter into the world, your lives will become very busy with the demands of your family, your friends, your profession, your community, and your Church service. You will lose track of one another unless you make an effort to stay in touch. Make that effort. You will find it incredibly rewarding. Fortunately, today's social media makes this a bit easier. Cherish these friendships and reach out. As the country song goes, "You can't make old friends" (Caitlyn Smith, Don Schlitz, and Ryan Hanna King, 2013). Keep them.<br><br>Remember your family. Your first priority is your immediate family or the family you will one day create. Nothing will bring you more happiness and joy than strong family relationships. Take care of your spouse, love your children, and give them your time. Reach out to extended family and nurture those relationships to help you and your children remember you are indeed part of a larger family unit.<br><br>The Snow tribe gathers each Fourth of July in the mountains of southern Utah. It is not a complicated family reunion. It is a one-day affair. We do the very same things each year. The menu even remains the same. For us it is an opportunity to spend time with those who have shaped our lives and made us who we are today. It is also a time for the next generation to make friends with cousins they do not otherwise see often. This time has become so popular with the new generation that some of the younger ones begin asking the afternoon of Christmas Day how long it is before the reunion.<br><br>Some of you have begun your own families. My wife, Phyllis, and I know what it is like to be married while in school. For six years we survived on macaroni and cheese, tuna fish, baloney, venison, and bottled peaches. We can recall when any purchase over three dollars demanded consultation. During many of my college years, every time I put on a Sunday suit I noticed baby slobber on the shoulder. Interestingly enough, we now look back on those times with great fondness. Living through them, however, is another thing entirely. Make certain you remember to thank your spouse for helping you be here today. Hopefully he or she has been able to achieve their educational goals as well. If not, there will come a time when you should shoulder some of the burden to make it possible for that to occur.<br><br>While this day is a major milestone in your life, trust me, the journey is just beginning. You cannot even imagine the adventures that lie ahead. I would encourage you to record that journey. Some of the most inspiring history comes from the diaries and journals of everyday people like you and me. You need not be a prominent Church leader and copious journal keeper like Wilford Woodruff or George Q. Cannon, but your story is important. Contribute to our body of history by keeping your own story. Your journal might not be highlighted in some future Church history display, but I can assure you it will be treasured by your children and grandchildren for many generations to come.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br>I promise you that if you will keep your journals and records they will indeed be a source of great inspiration to your families, to your children, your grandchildren, and others, on through the generations. ["Hold Fast to the Iron Rod," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1978]<br><br>The truth of the matter is that if you don't write your story, it may not get written. Worse still, it might be told by someone else in a way you do not desire. The one who has the last word is the one who writes it down. Remember to keep a journal.<br><br>Remember to serve. Your family will keep you very busy, and Church service opportunities will come to you often in the future. Honor these callings and do your very best. Be a good parent, but as your time and circumstances permit, reach out to serve those in your neighborhood, your school district, or your community. I would echo the words of Dr. Albert Schweitzer:<br><br><i>I don't know what your destiny will be, . . . but I know one thing: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.</i> ["The Meaning of Ideals in Life," speech given at Silcoates School, Wakefield, England, 3 December 1935; translated from the French in "Visit of Dr. Albert Schweitzer," <i>The Silcoatian,</i> New Series, no. 25 (December 1935): 784–85, myhome.spu.edu/sperisho/SchweitzerInTheSilcoatian.pdf; see also liberlocorumcommunium.blogspot.com/2010/10/schweitzer-on-service.html]<br><br>Finally, remember the importance of faith in your life. Living gospel principles as best as you are able will immeasurably bless your life and the lives of your family members. Study, pray together as a family, and faithfully attend your worship services. Some days this will seem difficult, and the temptation will be to skip Church just this once. Do not fall into that trap. Be faithful in your Church attendance and serve well in the callings that come your way. Church service is not always convenient, but it will make you a better person, a better member of your family, and a better member of society. Don't let the demands of the world lead to compromises when it comes to your faith. Remember the spiritual experiences that have developed your testimony, live the gospel, teach your family gospel principles, and be a good example to them.<br><br>When it comes to faith, remembering is not enough. It is essential that you live so you are entitled to receive new spiritual experiences. Stay strong and stay close to the Spirit so you might be blessed with future spiritual experiences that will strengthen and enrich your faith. So when it comes to your faith, remember what you have learned and felt but also live worthily to renew your faith and testimony.<br><br>Remember to enjoy the journey. As President Gordon B. Hinckley once said, "Save your fork. The best is yet to come." I truly believe that, and I wish you a wonderful life as you leave here for the many wonderful adventures that lie ahead. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven E. Snow was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 23 April 2015.</i><br><br><i>© by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>: Finding Our Anchor in Turbulent Times - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled and thankful to be among so many friends today and to see so many of my current and former students. Thank you for this opportunity, President Worthen.<br><br>I grew up on a large cattle ranch, first near Eureka, Nevada, and later in Kanosh, Utah. I would start the days very early by catching and saddling my horse in the moonlit and frosty morning hours. As the first rays of sunshine would start coming over the mountains, the cowboys I was working with would scatter out and begin looking for cows and calves from among sagebrush flats and juniper-covered hillsides. The sight was surreal as I would watch hundreds of cows and calves being herded toward a corral to be branded and vaccinated.<br><br>As a young boy I aspired to be able to rope the calves as my part of the branding. Alternative responsibilities entailed wrestling the calves to the ground, oftentimes resulting in me getting kicked or run over. At about the age of seven, after repeated failures in tackling the calves, I was finally allowed to try my hand at roping. I remember proudly getting my lasso rope ready and searching out the smallest and slowest-looking calf in the herd. I carefully planned my throw, and I felt the thrill of accomplishment when the loop settled over the calf successfully. Though the calf was seemingly small and slow, I felt its tremendous force start to jerk me off my horse. Despite trying my best to hold onto the calf, I found that my strength was no match for him. Just as I was being violently jerked out of my saddle, I heard a wise cowboy yell across to me: "Dally up!"<br><br>To dally means to take the rope and making two or three quick wraps around the saddle horn. The saddle becomes an anchor point, which connects to the greater strength of a steady and powerful horse. The dally transformed my situation of having inadequate personal strength to being able to access a greater power that anchored the turbulent polar forces acting upon me. This simple act allowed me to draw strength from something far greater than myself. Instead of being violently yanked from my saddle, I found the relative ease of letting my horse do the pulling while I had the much more simple and manageable task of holding the dally tight and maintaining the connection to the anchoring force.<br><br>Many times in my life since then I have felt the strength of greater powers than I have been prepared to withstand. These have seemed to yank me from a place of security and comfort. Each time, I have reflected upon opportunities to dally up to a power greater than my own that can serve as an anchor of strength. I would like to share some of the points of my learning about how to dally up in our inevitable circumstances and the need to find our anchor during turbulent times in our lives:<br><br>1. Strength in service<br><br>2. Strength in involvement<br><br>3. Strength in commitments<br><h2><b>Strength in Service</b></h2><br>When I was four my father was killed in a farming accident. I remember the confusion, the pain, and the worry of my widowed mother. My father was near completion of his degree from BYU and had returned to the family farm to support his young family. Upon his untimely death, many faculty members and department representatives reached out to our family to make sure my father's diploma was received. I remember the small cap and gown that was prepared for me and the nervous excitement of participating in graduation exercises. The personal care, the concern, and the service that those faculty members and administrators gave to my family became an anchor during our tragedy. They continued that care and concern for years, up through the time I was able to be a student myself on this campus and receive my own diploma. The fourth AIM of a BYU education--"lifelong learning and service"<sup>1</sup>--has had special significance for me, as I have felt an association between BYU and service on a deeply personal level. My love for BYU students, faculty, and administrators comes because I have been loved by so many in so many ways.<br><br>My definition of service comes from Alma 17. Upon feeling a desire to change and to transition from selfish actions to selfless service, the sons of Mosiah "fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be <i>an instrument in the hands of God.</i>"<sup>2</sup> This campus is filled with many instruments--scientific, laboratory, research, musical, and others. Instruments provide access to all kinds of power. As opposed to tools, which have an inherent power within them based on mass and force, the power of instruments comes from the skill of a master. A master surgeon, a master musician, or a master teacher can do remarkable things while working with instruments.<br><br>The sons of Mosiah were not seeking language skills, motivational techniques, behavioral understanding, or psychological analysis of the individuals they were serving. They were seeking to be instruments in the hands of God, allowing His power to flow through them and be made manifest in the lives of those they served. One of the most humbling emotions we can experience is feeling God's perfect power and trust working through us, achieving far greater results than we otherwise could imagine. Those being served are impacted more deeply, and those serving also are blessed. Power in service is the power of God working through us as instruments. Y-Serve students at BYU exemplify the anchoring power of service, especially how being an instrument in God's hands anchors our relationship to Him. [A video about BYU students serving through the Y-Serve office was shown.] Notice the anchoring power of service in the lives of these students, their examples of service, and the strength that service has brought.<br><h2><b>Strength in Involvement</b></h2><br>We are fortunate on this campus to have offices, ecclesiastical groups, and activities that facilitate service opportunities. BYUSA, Student Leadership, the University Accessibility Center, Multicultural Student Services, International Student Services, the Residence Halls Association, the Marriott Undergraduate Student Association, First-Year Experience, academic and BYUSA clubs, Student Alumni, wards and stakes, Women's Services and Resources, and the previously mentioned Y-Serve are some of the organizations that provide opportunities to get involved on campus and in the community. As I work with departments and organizations focused on service, I am amazed at the mutual reciprocity between servers and receivers that allows service to flow between them. I love the parables found in Luke 15 that I believe explain both the purposes and the people intended to get involved.<br><br>The first is the parable of the lost sheep. My kids and I have a farm near our home in Salem. My kids raise animals to pay for their activities, educations, and missions. We are very familiar with the concept of animals getting out and wandering. The parable of the lost sheep is about leaving the comfort of the flock and the fold and looking for something better, probably food. Looking for something better is not a bad thing. Don't we all aspire to find something better in our lives? In fact, isn't coming to college much like leaving our comfortable flock and fold to venture out to an unfamiliar environment that will improve our situation?<br><br>Across campus there are activities, events, involvement, and food that are publicized to encourage and entice the lost sheep of campus to find something better. Are we looking for these lost sheep and helping them find their way? President Worthen has often said that if we look hard enough, those students are easy to see. In one way or another, we all are looking for something better, and it can be challenging to find something better without a caring shepherd to assist our efforts. Let us be those shepherds. Service is the connecting conduit that brings lost souls from the periphery into the fold of involvement and acceptance.<br><br>The second parable is of the lost coin. This wasn't an issue of monetary devaluation, but it was an issue of priority. The money meant something to the woman, but perhaps not enough to be a high priority of care and concern for her. Other tasks, other items, and perhaps other people caused her to neglect her coin until it became lost.<br><br>How many people on campus who have infinite worth are neglected as we worry more about our own selfish tasks, our own items, and our own circles of friends? One of my greatest wishes for this campus is that the worth of each student is recognized and not one is lost in obscurity or has a feeling of unimportance and neglect. To accomplish that, we all need to reach out in care, compassion, and conversation to each other. During inevitable times of sadness, loneliness, or inadequacy, there are thousands of students, programs, clubs, activities, and opportunities awaiting you. Instead of waiting for them to find you, please step up and volunteer to lead those activities. Leaders feel the strongest anchor through increased investment and involvement.<br><br>The worth of souls, we know, is great to God; let us never neglect each person who is a child of Him. I am grateful each day to learn about the stories and lives of individual students who become involved. They are fascinating in what they have overcome, what talents they bring, and who they are. Each of us has a story, and each of us has great worth. Taking the time to get to know others offers us great opportunities to learn charity through our involvement.<br><br>Elder Marvin J. Ashton defined charity in the following way:<br><br><i>Real charity is not something you give away; it is something that you acquire and make a part of yourself. And when the virtue of charity becomes implanted in your heart, you are never the same again. . . .</i><br><br><i>Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don't judge or categorize someone else, when we simply give each other the benefit of the doubt or remain quiet. Charity is accepting someone's differences, weaknesses, and shortcomings; having patience with someone who has let us down; or resisting the impulse to become offended when someone doesn't handle something the way we might have hoped. Charity is refusing to take advantage of another's weakness and being willing to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charity is expecting the best of each other.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Charity for others becomes an anchoring point, achieved by knowing the Savior through seeing and serving others as He does. Service is the laboratory for learning charity. As we come to have charity for others, love God, and serve others, we begin to be stronger in the covenants and commitments that bind us to them and to find their infinite worth.<br><br>The third parable is of the prodigal son. It is an instance of selfishness and rebellion. For whatever reason, there are those in our midst who are in open rebellion or are participating in selfish behaviors. Often their actions are detrimental and destructive. Their storminess and turbulence create divisiveness and dissension. The parable of the prodigal son teaches unconditional love for the individual, even when we don't accept their behaviors. But if left unchecked, rebellious actions lead to a loss of the sense of the sacred that Elder D. Todd Christofferson spoke of when he stated:<br><br><i>The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this--if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.</i><br><br><i>On the other hand, with a sense of the sacred, one grows in understanding and truth. The Holy Spirit becomes his frequent and then constant companion. More and more he will stand in holy places and be entrusted with holy things. Just the opposite of cynicism and despair, his end is eternal life.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>We have the opportunity and responsibility through service and involvement to help those who are willfully rebelling regain their sense of the sacred. This can be the most difficult service that we give, but it can yield high rewards throughout eternity.<br><h2><b>Strength in Commitments</b></h2><br>In his inaugural address at BYU, President Kevin J Worthen stated:<br><br><i>We must go to the mountains spiritually if we are to obtain an elevated and ethereal education. It is not enough to gain learning by study; we must also live our lives in such a way that we--both students and faculty--are able to receive inspiration directly from God. That requires adherence to both the spirit and letter of the Honor Code--which was designed not just to distinguish us from other universities but to prepare us for elevated forms of learning.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>One way that we are a unique and elevated university is through our observance and commitment to the Honor Code that President Worthen spoke of. The Honor Code is a blessing and an anchor given to us at BYU to stabilize our moral, academic, social, and spiritual pursuits. As President Worthen also explained, it is designed to elevate us in these pursuits. I am saddened by those who continually neglect aspects of the Honor Code or, worse, try to reduce the rigor of the Honor Code by changing it. They argue that it is outdated and antiquated. Yet elevated learning and constancy in commitment are unwavering blessings that are part of our "quest for perfection and eternal life,"6 as stated in the Mission of BYU. How can we truly expect the anchoring power of the Spirit in our lives if we are lax, lazy, or disparaging in our observance to a commitment that we have made? Is it elevated learning if we seek the minimum of standards or play the game of not getting caught? A student I recently met had grown his hair for two years until it reached down his back while still attending classes, church, and activities on campus. He explained that it became a quest for him to see how long he could go without someone telling him to cut his hair. He placed the responsibility for his commitment on others to enforce it. That student has now come around, is one of my dear friends, and is doing fantastically well with Honor Code compliance--haircut in place.<br><br>Other students rationalize that if they don't have a test in the Testing Center, an intramural game, or a work requirement, dress and grooming standards don't need to be observed. They begin to focus on enforcement by the institution and not the integrity of the individual. In fact, the first point of the Honor Code is honesty. I believe that if all students understood and esteemed this point of being honest in their commitments and their covenants, then we wouldn't have to talk about how often to shave, what constitutes modest clothing, what moral boundaries not to cross, academic honesty, curfew times, and even the dreaded man bun. Our vision would be lifted from the minimally accepted social standards to what President Worthen called "elevated and ethereal education." What distinguishes us from other universities is the individual commitment of each student to uphold his or her commitment based on individual integrity. This is summed up in the beautiful poem by Edwin Markham:<br><br><i>Why build these cities glorious</i><br><i>If man unbuilded goes?</i><br><i>In vain we build the world, unless</i><br><i>The builder also grows.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I appreciate an institution that is not just concerned with building facilities, reputations, and research but that is based on a foundation of integrity and commitment. Individuals will be able to experience elevated learning that helps build testimonies, families, communities, careers, and the Church. In construction, the quality of the materials determines the strength of the product; with our learning, our character and commitment determine the strength of our product, anchored resolutely to the infinite power of God.<br><br>Ether 12:27 reads: "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble." Notice that the scripture refers to <i>weakness--</i>a singular term. In the presence of God, I imagine I would recognize many areas of improvement that I would need to make. Yet this scripture states that in His presence it is our weakness that we are shown. I believe this weakness refers to our relationship with God. If we come to Him, we see the infinite and perfect love that He has for us. Yet we also see the weakness in our relationship with Him and the many ways in which we are lax and lazy in how we honor Him, pray to Him, and show our love to Him. That is very humbling. But if we are humble and actively come to Him, the scripture goes on to say, "If they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak <i>things</i> [plural] become strong unto them." If we strengthen our relationship with the Savior, the many weaknesses we have are made strong. It is not merely us that changes.<br><br>This is the beautiful lesson I learned as a young boy: that I could dally up to an anchor point that would allow me access to a far greater power than my own and that exerting my efforts on holding that anchor point strong and tight was manageable to me if my focus was on the connection to the anchor point, rather than on my own inadequate power.<br><br>I am grateful to work with students who are striving to dally up to the power of service, involvement, and commitments during turbulent times in their lives. I am grateful for their humility when they have trusted in their own power and have found it to be inadequate to withstand temptations and turbulent times. I am grateful when their humility leads to accountability for their actions. I am grateful for the masses of students, faculty, administrators, bishops, advisors, Honor Code counselors, therapists, and family members who collectively recognize the worth of a soul and stand ready to help. And I am most grateful for a loving Savior who allows us to be His fellow servants by being instruments in His hands. When we reflect upon Him as an anchor in our lives, I am grateful for the physical manifestation of the marks driven through His hands and feet that show the depth of sacrifice and charity from Him that sustains and blesses us today.<br><br>May we be steadfast and immovable in our relationship with Him through our opportunities to serve and by dallying up to His power through the commitments and covenants we make. I testify of these truths and say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Casey Peterson was the BYU associate dean of students when this devotional address was given on 5 May 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i> (Provo: BYU, 2014), 5.<br><br>2.

<h1>ust Be Wholeheartedly Holy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is good to be with you this morning. While in a moment I will draw on the academic disciplines of Egyptology and biblical studies, in which I have been so steeped over the last few decades, I want to start out by trying to draw an analogy from one of my favorite things to do: waterskiing. The way I read the accounts of the Savior and Peter on the Sea of Galilee, it seems to me that waterskiing is the closest thing we have to a celestial sport. I can't get enough of it. In fact, one year my brothers, a cousin, and I made the goal of skiing on Utah Lake every month of the year. During January and February we questioned the wisdom of this goal, but we did it. I skied every time I got the chance.<br><br>During all these years of waterskiing I have had the chance to teach a lot of people how to ski. I believe I taught around 100 people. As I did so, I realized that there are really only three things people have to do to learn how to ski. The first is to keep their skis together. Often the pressure of the water will cause a person to do the splits, and it is very hard to ski that way. But there are ways to tie skis together, so this isn't the biggest problem.<br><br>The most difficult problem comes because you have an instinctive tendency to try to stand on top of the water as the boat pulls you. As a result, just as the boat pulls people up, most of them pull on the rope and push with their legs. Instead of being helpful, both of these actions tend to pull people's legs out from under them, and they immediately fall. Most of the time the action of pulling on the rope was so instinctive that people didn't even realize they had done it. I can't tell you how many times I repeated the mantra "arms straight, knees bent, skis together." I would explain again and again that the boat was strong enough to pull a person up--they just had to be patient enough to let it.<br><br>Here is the lesson: When those I taught learned to forget about using their own strength to get up and relied on the power of the boat, they would ski. When you master your impulse to pull yourself up, you get on top of the water; then the ability to accelerate, cut through the water, float on a sea of glass, and sail with an amazing feeling of freedom and exhilaration is waiting for you.<br><br>While this analogy can be applied in a number of ways, today I want to compare it to something I have seen that ancient Israel struggled with. During the two decades I have been teaching the Old Testament, I have found that for most of us it just seems weird when we read about ancient Israel's struggles with idolatry. We cannot imagine why they would stop worshipping Jehovah and instead worship things carved from wood or stone or molded from metal. We ask ourselves, "What were they thinking? What is wrong with them?" Yet I have found that we should never ask ourselves, "What is wrong with them?" Instead we should ask, "What is wrong with them and me?" If ancient Israel struggled with something, surely we struggle with it as well. We should not ask ourselves <i>if</i> we struggle with the things that tempted them; rather, we should ask <i>how</i> we do the same thing.<br><br>I have also found that we can more easily answer this question when we come to a more accurate view of exactly what ancient Israel was struggling with. I believe we are wrong when we think they stopped worshipping Jehovah and started worshipping other gods. While some did stop worshipping God, most kept worshipping Him--they just added the worship of other gods. They worshipped Jehovah and Asherah or Jehovah and Anat, Ba'al, Chemosh, Molech, and so on.<br><br>The problem is that everyone around them was doing this. Their neighbors had gods that they focused on, but they were also willing to adopt new gods as they encountered them. As Israel drank in the culture around them, it seemed only natural to keep worshipping Jehovah but also to worship the things their neighbors worshipped. Most likely many of them felt just fine about doing this because they continued to feel quite devout toward Jehovah. It is this attempt to worship more than one god at the same time that Elijah addressed on Mount Carmel when he challenged the priests of Ba'al. During that contest he thundered out to Israel: "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him" (1 Kings 18:21).<br><br>The word <i>halt</i> here does not mean "stop," as we usually think it does. It is used in this scripture in the same way that it is used in the New Testament: to mean that someone is lame or unable to walk. Perhaps a better translation would be "How long limp ye between two opinions?" Elijah was not asking them why they couldn't choose which god to worship but rather was pointing out that they could not really go anywhere as long as they were trying to worship both gods. In effect, by relying on something in addition to Jehovah, they were pulling their legs out from under themselves just as are those who are trying to learn to waterski but who rely on their own strength as well as the boat's.<br><br>Now that we know ancient Israel was worshipping both the true God and false gods at the same time, our task is, as I said earlier, not to ask ourselves <i>if</i> but instead <i>how</i> we do the same thing. I believe there is no doubt that we all worship more than one god. For some of us, instead of worshipping both Jehovah and Ba'al, we worship Jehovah and footba'al. For others it is video games, material possessions, or a whole host of other things. Yet over the last twenty years, as I have tried to observe the ways in which we struggle with idolatry, I have become convinced that on the whole we struggle with one kind of false god more than any other. We tend to worship the ideas of the world, and, like those who pull on the waterski rope, we don't even realize we are doing it.<br><br>The problem is that the world has been shouting its ideas at us loudly and incessantly from the time we were very small. We encounter these ideas in our schools, from kindergarten through college. We are inundated with them as we read newspapers, watch TV and movies, or listen to the radio--and in a hundred other ways. Many of the concepts we encounter are harmless enough, but most of the time we are not very careful in sifting through the ideas we hear, and I am certain we have all swallowed a lot of fallacious and dangerous ideas without even realizing it. As President Thomas S. Monson said at the rededication of the Boise Idaho Temple, you "walk in a world saturated with the sophistries of Satan" ("Boise Idaho Temple: 'Again Hallowed,'" <i>Church News,</i> 24 November 2012, ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/62997/Boise-Idaho-Temple-Again-hallowed.html#).<br><br>Sadly, Satan's ideas are so prevalent and often so subtly, consistently, and insidiously conveyed that we usually are not aware we have adopted them. We drink so heavily from the well of the world's influence that such influence can become part of the fabric of who we are without our even realizing it. And so we keep pulling on that waterski rope and wondering why our spiritual legs keep going out from under us.<br><br>Of late, several of our leaders have spoken of the danger of trying to simultaneously worship the worldly god of tolerance and follow the true God's teachings of right and wrong (see Dallin H. Oaks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/no-other-gods?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Other Gods</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2013). Perhaps I can add an illustration from my own classes. Back when I regularly taught world civilization courses, we would discuss the cultures found in ancient Mesoamerica. A small part of our time was spent discussing the violent rituals of human sacrifice that the Spanish conquistadors encountered there. As I tried to frame a discussion about these violent acts and their effect on cultural interaction, I often asked my students what they thought about the horrific rituals we were discussing. I found that if I asked about the ritual practice, it was quickly condemned. But if I phrased the question in terms of what my students thought about this element of ancient culture, I was lucky if even one student would speak negatively of it. My students had been taught so regularly and thoroughly that we must be tolerant of other people's cultures that they could not bring themselves to say that human or child sacrifice was a bad element of culture.<br><br>Now, I believe the Bible is fairly clear on this point. A number of passages make it very plain that God finds this practice completely unacceptable. Yet too often my students could not quite commit to this gospel truth because it conflicted with the ideas of the world that they have been immersed in since their youth. Without realizing it, they had begun to struggle with trying to worship God <i>and</i> the ideas of the world at the same time. If they had a hard time condemning human sacrifice, I can only imagine what else the world had convinced them that they should not call wrong. The ways of the world were surely affecting their ability to fully see things the way God wanted them to. Insightfully, President Boyd K. Packer warned that the virtue of tolerance could become a vice in just this way (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1990/10/covenants?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covenants</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1990).<br><br>I wish to make sure I am not misunderstood. In its place, tolerance is a wonderful virtue. I am not preaching intolerance. But for it to be a virtue, tolerance must be felt and practiced in God's way, not the world's way. When we try to practice godly virtues in the way the world wants us to, then we are halting between two opinions--we are doing our own version of worshipping Jehovah and Ba'al at the same time. Of course, adopting the worldly version of tolerance isn't the only way we do this. In many ways each of us falls for even more subtle idols of worldly influenced thinking.<br><br>Often the most subtle false-idea gods start out as something good. Ancient Israel struggled with this too. For instance, in biblical times it became a practice in many places to set up a stone that would remind people of God. This practice probably started out with harmless intents. God even commanded Israel to set up stones taken from the Jordan River to remind them of how He had parted the river for them as they entered the promised land. The stones were not carved, so they were not "graven images," and it <i>is</i> actually a good thing to have something that helps you think of God more often. Stones that were designed to remind the Israelites of God were called <i>matsebot</i> in Hebrew. The problem with matsebot is that they didn't just remain stones that reminded a person of God. Over time they became objects of adoration. They slowly shifted into a kind of idol. My guess is that our Israelite ancestors didn't recognize that they had made the change; the idolatrous shift in their hearts went unnoticed.<br><br>And so we again have to ask ourselves not <i>if</i> but <i>how</i> we do this same thing. How do we start out with good intents and yet let ourselves be influenced by the ideas of the world in such a way that soon good things become idols? I am sure that we do this in too many ways to count, but let me talk about a few of the more common ways.<br><br>In our church we value hard work. We value doing well. We value taking care of our families and contributing to the community. The characteristics we try to develop often help us to be very good at these things. Typically we start out wanting to do well at our jobs, to do well at school, to do good things in the community, to learn to play the piano or sing, and so on--all because we see these accomplishments as things that will help us build the kingdom of God. But the world sees these accomplishments as markers of success in and of themselves, not as ends to the means of furthering the cause of Zion. Sadly we fall into that trap so easily. As the world lauds these accomplishments, it usually does not take long until we start to use worldly standards and measure success by how well we do at work or by what kinds of degrees we have or by how much recognition we get from others for the things we do or the talents we have developed.<br><br>The problem is not in doing well at any of these things; the problem is when we believe the world that this is how we measure success. While all of these things are worthwhile in some ways, I doubt very much that this is how God measures success. In fact, the Savior said, "That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God" (Luke 16:15). Yet it is so easy for God's voice to be overpowered by or, at the very least, strongly mingled with and diluted by the voice of the world. And when we start to let the world define prestige or success for us, then we have erected matsebot in our lives and we have pulled our legs out from under ourselves.<br><br>Let me provide an even more concrete or detailed example of how this might happen. Clearly the most important endeavor you will undertake in this life will be within the walls of your own home. Much of what you will spend the rest of your life doing will center around your family. You will try to earn money to support a family. You will be involved in schools and community groups, perhaps even in politics and social movements, all in an effort to take care of your family and create an ideal environment for them. At the same time, many of these things will bring the praise of the world. But the world does not value these efforts for the same reasons God does. Without great care, eventually the praise of the world will cause us to adopt the world's values. We begin to do these things both to help our family <i>and</i> to garner the acceptance of the world. We try to serve two masters, or limp between two opinions.<br><br>As we pursue this course, and to some degree we all do, times will arise that will force us to make choices. Do we spend a little more time away from family to find success at work, in the PTA, on mommy blogs, in a reading club, on the golf course, and so on (fill in the blank here for what you spend time doing)? All of these things can be very good, and, in fact, the outward actions of someone who is single-mindedly serving God may look exactly the same as the actions of someone who is believing both God's and the world's ideas. What we must ask ourselves is if we are doing what we do because of the world's values as much as because of God's.<br><br>Sadly, when we have begun to savor the values of the world, we are in a no-win situation. If we choose time away from family in order to pursue the praise of the world, we will have lost. Yet if we make the right decision while still holding to at least some of the values of the world, we will deprive ourselves of some of the joy and progress that would normally follow making the right choice. We will find ourselves feeling conflicted, slightly hollow, and not as satisfied as we could and should be. Our idolatry will have robbed us, and our spiritual progress will be stunted in comparison to what it could be--all because we are limping along following both God's and the world's ideas. We will question our abilities and worth because the world will be telling us we are worth less, and we partially believe them. While they are not alone in this, often stay-at-home moms in particular struggle with this because the world is very, very anxious to tell them that they are not spending as much time as they should on the things the world values. To the degree that we accept the world's way of setting values and priorities, we will lose out on the ability to find contentment and satisfaction in doing the things of God for godly reasons. In some way this will be true of all of us, regardless of vocation or how we spend our time. Even our understanding of gospel principles can be affected when we are heavily influenced by the world's values and priorities.<br><br>The Savior warned us about this repeatedly. For example, he berated Peter for savoring "not the things that be of God, but those that be of men" (Matthew 16:23). He also warned that even those who had received and nourished the word could have the gospel choked out by the "cares and riches and pleasures of this life" (Luke 8:14).<br><br>Even with these warnings it seems we continue to allow ourselves to be influenced by the world. I have not done a scientific study of this, but my impression is that Latter-day Saints tend to follow the trends of the world around them, lagging just a little behind. The rates of successful marriages, family sizes, the immodesty of our clothing, and the crudeness of our entertainment usually follow the trends of the world--we just stay slightly better. We kid ourselves that we are being holy because our shorts or skirts are not as short as everyone else's and our topics of conversation are not as crude as those of the world around us. But the reality is that if our standards are so constantly affected by the world's, it does not matter if we are doing better than everyone else; the world is still setting our standards instead of God.<br><br>I have noticed that in areas of the country or the world where issues such as same-sex marriage, gender leadership equality, family size, and other social matters are all the rage, our members tend to struggle more with these issues. While awareness of such issues is important and helpful and while listening to others' ideas can help us to seek further direction from God, we must also be careful that we are neither blinded by the mists of Satan's sophistries nor so afraid of those mocking from the great and spacious building that we let our opinions be set by others rather than by the true doctrines of God, as Elder Dallin H. Oaks warned us two years ago in general conference (see "No Other Gods"). So much of how we think about these issues is set by those in Hollywood, those who write songs, those who sit behind news desks, those who stand in front of the chalkboard, those who speak in the halls of Congress, or those who write columns and blogs. We often do not realize how much these things have affected our thinking and the way we view the world. We should be extremely wary of these worldly sources, for God's ways are higher than their ways and His thoughts are higher than their thoughts (see Isaiah 55:9). Too many of those of the world are those that Nephi warned would "revile against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth!" (2 Nephi 28:16). When we allow such people to influence our thinking even a little, we will find ourselves feeling an internal conflict as we try to reconcile the part of us that believes what God has told us with the part of us that has started to savor the ideas of the world without our notice.<br><br>As we hobble along by following both the ideas of God and the world, the conflict between these competing ideas will sooner or later create some kind of crisis, for listening to the world is akin to pulling on the waterski rope of life, and the only possible result is that we will fall flat on our backs. Sometimes these crises come in the shape of not feeling sure what we should do with our lives. Sometimes they come at the cost of our self-esteem, and other times they create a cost that our families, ward members, and others must pay. Most often <i>all</i> of these things happen. Sometimes the conflict causes a crisis of faith. This is unsurprising. The ways of the world are in direct conflict with faith, so the messages of the world are sometimes subtly, and sometimes overtly, antireligious. When we harbor the cancerous ideas of the world, they will eventually attack and kill the pure cells of faith that make up our spiritual body. When this happens, we may be able to live with the cancer for a while, but sooner or later there will be only two options: either the tumors of worldly thinking will kill our spiritual lives or we will have to cut the cancer out.<br><br>Sometimes these crises arise over social issues. We should expect this. Even if those who live in the great and spacious building have good intents and are acting the best they can according to the knowledge they have, we must be aware that they have made a full-time vocation out of mocking those who hold to the rod and partake of the fruit of the tree of life. Thus we can expect that when we cling to God's way of thinking, there will be many who try to make us feel stupid for doing so. When we stand up for truths such as morality, marriage, revelation, prophets, priesthood, and the inspiration of scripture, there will be those who do their very best to make us feel parochial, backward, uncultured, unthinking, unsophisticated, and foolish. These scoffers are very good at what they do and, ironically, somehow find a way to sound as if <i>they</i> are on the moral high ground. The inhabitants of the great and spacious building greatly outnumber us and can make it seem like we are so silly and alone in our way of thinking. As a result, we often adjust our thinking in order to align ourselves with these seeming sophisticates. At other times we just remain quiet, hoping no one will notice our faithful viewpoint. Either way, we get lost in the mists of darkness as we loosen our grip on the iron rod.<br><br>At other times these crises arise over historical or doctrinal issues. This also should not surprise us. As we have said before, God's ways of thinking are higher than ours, and thus we should not be surprised when we don't understand everything He has said or done. I have spent my adult lifetime studying the translation of the book of Abraham. Some have experienced a kind of crisis over what the world has to say about Joseph Smith's abilities to translate and how that relates to the book of Abraham. While we will not go into detail here today, I can tell you that careful study and research have provided very strong and well-supported answers for all of the major questions those in the great and spacious building have thrown at us. Note that I said all of the <i>major</i> questions, but I did not say <i>every</i> question. There are still questions about the translation of the book of Abraham for which we have no answers. In fact, I have sat down numerous times and tried to come up with theories or hypotheses that could account for all the facts we have at our disposal. I have tried to propose theories from a nonbelieving perspective and from a believing perspective. I believe that the nonbelieving theories have far more holes in them, but in truth, nothing I have thought of can account for all the data we have, and in some ways this is very comforting to me.<br><br>If we think about it, wouldn't we be surprised if we <i>could</i> understand exactly how God works when He helps a prophet with an inspired translation? Frankly, given my current limited and finite mind, I would be a bit disappointed if I was capable of understanding just how God works. That would imply that God's state isn't really that far advanced from mine. In fact, it would be a fair bit of pride for any of us to think that we can understand all the whats and whys of God's historical dealings with His people, prophets, and scriptures. Let me say again, His thoughts are higher than ours. Trusting in His ideas is like allowing the boat to pull you out of the water, and amazing things are in store for those who do.<br><br>But to the world, trusting in something we cannot fully understand is laughable, so they point their fingers and mock while standing in a great and spacious building that has no foundation and is destined to fall, which will put all of its inhabitants flat on their backs like so many of those I was teaching to ski. Still, as they mock, many others who are holding to the rod will loosen their grip, get lost in the mists of darkness, and limp along between two opinions. Yet those who have tasted the goodness of the fruit can remain strong, even when they don't fully understand everything. Even when they aren't eating the fruit at the moment, their memory of how delicious the fruit tasted or of how they felt when they had the Spirit with them can be enough to help them withstand the ideas and the mocking of the world.<br><br>None of this is to imply that we cannot learn things of value from the world around us. In fact, we are commanded to learn wisdom from the best ideas and books available (see D&amp;amp;C 88:118). But we must learn to sift these ideas through the gospel rather than sift the gospel through these ideas. Our values and priorities must be derived from God or we will eventually abandon them and journey toward the great and spacious building.<br><br>You see, we must be what God calls a "peculiar" or a "holy" people. At its most basic root, the word <i>holy</i> means to be set aside or to be different than everything else. To use President Kevin J Worthen's phrase, we must "be etherealized" ("<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen_enlightened-uplifted-changed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enlightened, Uplifted, and Changed</a>," BYU inauguration devotional address, 9 September 2014). If we are truly going to be holy, we will have to overcome our desire to fit in and think like everyone else and instead relish the idea of thinking more like God and less like this world. That is why God commands His Latter-day Saints to "go ye out from Babylon" (D&amp;amp;C 133:5). Leaving intellectual Babylon and becoming holy, etherealized, or peculiar will cause us to be like Enoch's people, who "confessed they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 45:13). In other words, many of the ways you think and feel now will eventually come to feel foreign to your higher, holier way of thinking.<br><br>Knowing all of this, we must ask ourselves what we should do about it. While all of us must do these things, I will phrase them in terms of what <i>you</i> must do, for I want each of you individually to think of how these things apply specifically to you. Let me suggest five things you must do if you are to avoid limping between two opinions and pulling your legs out from under yourself.<br><br>First, you must conclude, as Elder Oaks once said, "that followers of Christ [must] think differently than others" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/as-he-thinketh-in-his-heart-?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As He Thinketh in His Heart</a>," Church Educational System Evening with a General Authority devotional, 8 February 2013). You must determine that you want to follow God's way of thinking more than the world's way.<br><br>Second, you must honestly ask yourself what worldly influenced ideas you are clinging to and then do everything you can to eradicate those ideas from your system. You will periodically have to engage in regular good and hard self-examination throughout your life, especially in times of crisis.<br><br>Third, you will not be able to successfully identify the ways in which your thoughts are inspired by worldly gods rather than by the one true God without God's help. Thus you must do all you can to have the Spirit with you as you engage in introspection <i>and</i> whenever you encounter new ideas. After all, it is only the Spirit that can make you holy or that can cause you to think and see as God does rather than as the world does. In other words, you must be etherealized. Left to your own fallen devices, you can only think and see from the world's fallen perspective. You will need the help of God to see things as He would have you see them.<br><br>Fourth, after having done this, you will have to do all you can to have the Spirit with you regularly so that you can maintain a holy perspective rather than give in to the ever-encroaching ideas of the world. We all know those things that we must do to have the Spirit with us. Despite your busy schedules, you must never take a break from engaging in activities that invite the Spirit into your lives. Because it is so important to engender a regular relationship with the Holy Ghost while you are here at BYU, let me echo Elder M. Russell Ballard's counsel from general conference just last month: "If you are attending a Church school, consistently include a class each semester in religious education" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/the-greatest-generation-of-young-adults?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Greatest Generation of Young Adults</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2015). Another reason you must have the Spirit with you is that your decision to serve God will not be enough. Only the Holy Ghost carrying the power of the Atonement into your soul will truly root out worldly ideas from you.<br><br>Fifth, when you are struggling because the way you are thinking or feeling at the moment seems to conflict with how God would have you think or feel, remember the times you have felt the Spirit in the past. We will not feel the Spirit at all times, and sometimes just when we are not, the mocking fingers of the world will hurt--and hurt deeply. But at those moments we must remember that we <i>have</i> felt God teach and testify to us of the eternal truth and import of His ideas, and then we must hold fast to those ideas just as we did when we felt His testifying Spirit. If we do, He will continue to sanctify us, or make us more holy. With His help, eventually we will become the kinds of beings who are capable of thinking and feeling just as He does. We will be holy beings, and the doctrines of the priesthood will distill upon our souls as the dews of heaven, and our everlasting dominion will flow unto us without compulsory means forever and ever (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46).<br><br>It is my prayer that this will happen for all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kerry M.

<h1>tars to Your Life&#039;s Sky - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is a pleasure to be with you.<br><br>Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote:<br><br><i>If the stars should appear</i> [only] <i>one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown</i> [in the heavens]<i>!</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Gazing upward into the blazing splendor of the night sky, we see thousands of distant stars and even more distant galaxies. This is truly amazing--and our reaction to it is equally remarkable. Think about what we do when we stargaze. Seeing light that left some distant suns about the time Columbus sailed for the New World, we immediately start ­creating associations between completely unrelated spheres--stars that are tens or hundreds of light years from each other and often even farther from the earth.<br><br>Making such mental connections gives the stars familiarity and meaning, and we begin to see them not only as separate points of light but as constellations--a scorpion, a hunter named Orion, or the Big Dipper.<br><br>There are practical uses for such astronomical inkblots. Try this: show your significant other pictures of various constellations and ask what he or she sees. If his answers are various types of weapons or characters from Middle Earth or if she replies, "I see a diamond engagement ring," three out of four times, perhaps you should imitate the ancient mariners who navigated by the stars and make a course correction.<br><br>One example of my own astrological incompetence is that for many years I thought I was seeing all of Ursa Major, or the Big Bear, which, candidly, to me looked a lot like a big dipper. In fact, I thought the Big Dipper and the Big Bear were simply two names for the same group of seven stars--until a wise friend explained that the Big Dipper is not actually a constellation but merely an asterism, or part of a constellation. I learned that you must include another twelve stars for the Big Dipper to become the Big Bear. Now, obviously I had seen those twelve stars before, but I had failed to recognize how they connected to and expanded what I already knew.<br><br>Similarly, in the few minutes we share today, I propose to offer four points of light for your consideration, in hopes that by thinking about them together and by connecting them to stars already in your life's sky, they will provide you with additional illumination and with greater direction in your life while at BYU and beyond.<br><h2><b>A First Star: Work Is Work</b></h2><br>Work is work, and that's okay; it is acceptable, normal, expected, and part of the plan. Whether you are a BYU student, faculty member, or staff employee, if you don't like work, you have come to the wrong university, and likely to the wrong planet. Schoolwork, missionary work, homework, and housework--thepart-time job you have now and the career vocation you may one day take on--each of these will be work in all of its four-letter glory.<br><br>A former teacher of mine weighed well over 300 pounds the first time he went skiing. New to the sport and unfamiliar with the resort, he asked for directions, and a cruel stranger sent him to a black diamond run.<br><br>Exiting the lift for the first time, he experienced a short-lived slide of sheer terror, which ended when he crashed violently, embedding himself into the deep snow at the base of a mogul. From there it was uphill both ways, and he was tangled in his skis and stuck--by his own description--like a beached whale in the snow.<br><br>He found that by gyrating his entire body, he could plow forward a few inches at a time. As difficult and tiring as this painstaking process was, much more frustrating were the scores of experienced skiers speeding by him with no concern for his plight. Finally, a female skier swooshed to a perfect stop next to him--and the several-foot-long trail in the snow that represented his efforts over the last forty-five minutes.<br><br>"Do you need any help?" she asked brightly. To him it was so painfully obvious that he did that his temper got the best of him and he looked up at her and curtly replied, "No, lady, this is what I came here to do." Insulted, or puzzled perhaps, she skied away, leaving him to another hour of belly flopping before he was finally free to hike down the mountain carrying his rented skis.<br><br>On days when I feel stuck--when progress is slow or nonexistent; when my life's tasks seem difficult, repetitive, or fruitless; or when any help sought seems unforthcoming or insufficient for my needs--it has helped me to remember that wonderful line, "This is what I came here to do," and to recognize that life's work and life's struggles, even the most difficult and mundane aspects for our existence, are truly, at least in part, what we came here todo.<br><br>The very injunction from Heavenly Father to Adam and Eve and to us as their posterity that we would earn our bread by the sweat of our brows (see Moses 5:1) implies that not every task in this life will be easy or enjoyable. Even in all His glory, God Himself talks about His work (see Moses 1:39), and we would do well to consider and emulate His focus, His devotion, and His power of engagement.<br><br>We learn that our immortality and our eternal life are His sole vocation. Nowhere in the scriptures are we told about God's ­hobbies, what He does with His downtime, or how many exciting vacations He has taken. It is both inspiring and frightening to realize that a Being of perfect understanding and unlimited power is focused on and committed to our eternal growth and happiness. I testify that Heworks at this much harder than you orIdo.<br><br>Always our example, from His earliest years Christ was ever about His Father's business. Jesus explained, "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day" (John 9:4), and "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work" (John 4:34).<br><br>We too then must work, remembering that we have been commanded to work out our "own salvation with fear and trembling" (Mormon 9:27). Using verbs that are diverse, instructive, and powerful, the scriptures lovingly command us to learn of the Savior (see D&amp;amp;C 19:23), to "strip [ourselves] of all uncleanness" (Mormon 9:28), to "prepare every needful thing" (D&amp;amp;C 88:119), to "counsel with the Lord" (Alma 37:37), and to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him" (Moroni 10:32).<br><br>Not only must we improve ourselves and repent of our sins, we also must be ready and willing to work in the fields of eternity to bless our own families and the lives of others. Those of you who are preparing for missions, please notice that the letter you will receive from the prophet will say that "you are hereby called to serve" and "assigned to labor."<br><br>All of us would do well to clearly define where and how we are currently called to labor, recognizing that our work, of necessity, should and must always be inexorably tied to the work of our Savior and our Father. We are to be men and women of action and accomplishment. It is inconsistent to expect God to guide our footsteps if we are unwilling to move our feet.<br><br>Among the Savior's many miracles recorded in the New Testament is the healing of ten ­lepers who approached Him, pleading, "Master, have mercy on us" (Luke 17:13). The Savior did, sending them back to their families, their friends, and their former lives. However, an important part of this story that initially escaped my attention is how He healed them, revealed in three small but potentially life-changing words. Luke 17:14 tells us the lepers were healed not as they stood on the roadside or knelt at the Savior's feet but rather "as theywent."<br><br>And so it will be with us. As we act, our paths will become clear, weak things can become strong (see Ether 12:27), and seeds we have planted in faith will swell and sprout and grow so that we know of their goodness (see Alma 32:33–34).<br><br>Yet all too often, in both temporal and spiritual matters, more of us talk the talk than walk the walk or, in this case, work the work. With the tasks that are your responsibility, do you sign your work with excellence, giving your best regardless of recognition or reward, or do you work just hard enough to get by?<br><br>When I was a teenager, my father was called to be the Centerville Eighth Ward's welfare coordinator. I quickly learned what this meant: each month he was one of the volunteers, and I was another. We worked in a grain-processing plant owned by the Church in which large bags of oatmeal and other products were packaged into smaller containers for use in the bishops' storehouses.<br><br>Working by his side, I learned a lot from my dad's example. Although he was in his later years, he was often the one who climbed the steep ladder into the loft to buck forty-pound bags into the hopper, while younger men joked below. He was always the one insisting we finish the shift, even when the quota was already reached. Every night he was the one ensuring the facility was cleaned and secured and ready for the next use, regardless of who stayed to help. He taught me without words that exactness, effort, and sacrifice should be part of our daily labor and that an obscure, two-story oat plant was not only part of the Lord's kingdom but also a proving ground for His servants.<br><h2><b>A Second Star: Time Is Precious</b></h2><br><b> </b>As we work, may we each consider that our time and our strength are limited.<b> </b>One of the constraints of a mortal probation is that we must be selective about how and where and with whom we spend our time.<br><br>Mortality's "arena of agency" forces us to make choices. As immortal children of an eternal Heavenly Father, it is expected that we will not only learn to discern between good and evil but also to choose wisely from among good, better, and best.<sup>2</sup><br><br>On the wall of the east transept of the Memorial Church at Stanford University are engraved these mighty words of St. Francis de Sales:<br><br><i>The best thoughts, affections and aspirations of a great soul are fixed on the infinitude of eternity. Destined as such a soul is for immortality, it finds all that is not eternal too short, all that is not infinite too small.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>As you choose your majors, your friends, and your classes at BYU, you are shaping eternity. The Savior has told us, "Settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you" (JST, Luke 14:28), and then He instructed that all who are wise stewards should first sit down and count the cost of the things they want to accomplish (see Luke 14:28).<br><br>While life lasts, you have the unparalleled opportunity to change and to grow. It does not matter what mistakes you have made, what sins you have committed, how often you have failed, or how awfully you have fallen short of your dreams or your potential in the past. Your future days are spotless and beckoning.<br><br>Unfortunately none of us knows which day in mortality will be our last. In 1989 I was a volunteer helping at BYU New Student Orientation. That was the day I met Chris Felsted--on the last day of his life. I found Chris on the ground where he had collapsed; he would never get up again. As we realized his peril, a friend started CPR while I summoned the paramedics.<br><br>One of you seated here today may be the recipient of the BYU scholarship that bears his name, funded by the endowment his loving parents created with his college fund in memory of their ­amazing son who was admitted to BYU but who graduated to his heavenly home before his first day of class. The uncertainty and fragility of mortality remind us that every day is sacred and every hour is important, for whether you perceive that your life at this moment offers much or little, your life--the only one you have--isnow.<br><br>Poets and philosophers have observed that tombstones each have a date of birth and a date of death--two dates that are often only ­separated by a simple dash--and yet the ­summary of our choices is displayed and the range of our opportunities in eternity is determined by what we do with the dash. Your time at BYU, just like your time in mortality, will have a beginning and an end. Choose wisely what you do with your dash.<br><br>As you do, please remember that many of BYU's best classes are not found in the catalog. They have no official course numbers and are taught only for those with eyes to see, often in the simple examples of the amazing people BYU has drawn here to be your friends and your faculty, your coworkers and your custodians.<br><br>For example, for me Compassion 401 was taught by a loving former BYU professor named J. Douglas Gibb. Let me share a sample of the curriculum. I didn't know Dr. Gibb when I arrived for the first day of a communications class he taught. I only knew that the classroom was overcrowded and that before we could get started he would need to dismiss many unregistered students who were now trying to add the class.<br><br>Looking us over, he simply asked, "How many of you are registered for this class?" About two-thirds of us raised our hands. "Read chapter one," he told us. "See you on Wednesday." And with that, we were excused.<br><br>I went into the hallway but decided to turn back and watch. Dr. Gibb talked to every student in the room. Where there was a necessity, for graduation or other circumstances, he added someone, but mostly he just got to know the students, one by one. No one left the room without feeling his concern and receiving his help.<br><br>Almost embarrassed, he explained, "I've reached the point in my life where I just don't want to offend anyone--not even my cat."<br><br>Both then and now, Dr. Gibb is the type of man I want to be, and over the short dash of my undergraduate time at BYU I came to know him both as a friend and as a mentor. He changed my life and the lives of many others by the way he taught both inside and outside BYU's classrooms.<br><h2><b>A Third Star: Storms Are Certain</b></h2><br>No matter who you are, your life will have storms; you will encounter discouragement, doubt, and defeat. The difficulties you will face will amaze and overwhelm you at times, but it is your very response to such trials that will build your character and determine your destiny.<br><br>A student in the young single adult ward in which I serve as bishop once explained, "One of the life lessons I've learned from playing video games is that if you find a path without any enemies, it doesn't lead anywhere." This may be the only actual valuable similarity between Halo and real life. Please don't play hundreds of hours trying to prove me wrong.<br><br>Opposition in life is necessary, but setbacks and struggles need not become frantic fear or debilitating discouragement. A tall freshman girl who came to Provo from Kansas said her upbringing in the Jayhawk State had made her a good basketball player and an experienced trash-talker long before she enrolled at BYU. Arriving on campus she quickly found out when and where basketball tryouts would be and went to the Richards Building on the appointed day.<br><br>Once there, however, her fears got the best of her, and though dressed and ready to play, she never went in. For three hours she paced in the hallway, unwilling to leave but unable to risk failing at a dream so big. Many years later she learned from the coach that BYU's basketball team that year had played all season one player short. The coach had been looking for a tall forward who could play inside, but the right girl never stepped up.<sup>4</sup><br><br>Please make your life a series of risks taken and opportunities realized. Never back down when you have a talent and know how you want to use it. This former student carried this experience with her, and throughout her life it has given her the resolve and the power to open many other doors, both for herself and for others. I share this story with her permission; her name is Sheri L. Dew, the current CEO of Deseret Book, who recently returned tocampus as a convocation speaker.<br><br>All of us who plan to reach the tree of life must be prepared to encounter mists of darkness and to endure shouts of derision from a building that is both tall and spacious. Whether your intended career is business, politics, science, sports, or music, there will be plenty of negative voices and a myriad of opportunities to give up or tap out. Consider the criticism and setbacks experienced by several prominent people along with the eventual outcomes.<br><br>Early in life Albert Einstein was called "the dopey one," and he struggled to speak.<sup>5</sup> He was asked to leave one school and was refused admission to another.<sup>6</sup> He worked as a patent clerk before changing humanity's understanding of the universe and becoming the personification of genius.<br><br>Wilma Rudolph contracted both double pneumonia and polio as a child.<sup>7</sup> Eventually her once-paralyzed left leg was fitted with a metal brace in hopes that she could somehow hobble her way through life. Instead, one step, one struggle, one race at a time, she endured until she became the fastest woman in the world and the winner of three Olympic gold medals.<br><br>Thomas Edison was fired from two jobs<sup>8</sup> and described as "addled" by one of his teachers.<sup>9</sup> Before he died he was the holder of 1,093 U.S. patents, with inventions including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and--after more than 1,000 unsuccessful attempts--the incandescent lightbulb.<br><br>Another who had faced great adversity, heartbreak, and failure once described his feelings with these words: "I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one cheerful face on earth."<sup>10</sup> Abraham Lincoln also saved the nation and changed the world through his wisdom, character, and courage.<br><br>So if you have failed a test or had your heart broken or been fired from a job or lost a loved one or an election or an intramural basketball game, welcome to the club. You are now in the company of the greatest heroes in earth's history. What you do next will make all the difference.<br><br>We humbly worship One who was "a man of sorrows" and well "acquainted with grief" (Isaiah 53:3), who "descended below all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:6). He was ridiculed and reviled and rejected and then betrayed in the closest and most cruel manner imaginable (see Matthew 26:47–49). The scriptures say that He had "no form nor comeliness ... that we should desire him" (Isaiah 53:2) and that we hid our faces from Him (see Isaiah 53:3), even as "he was wounded for our transgressions," healed us "with his stripes" (Isaiah 53:5), and engraved us everlastingly on the palms of His hands through the miracle of the Atonement (see Isaiah 49:15–16).<br><h2><b>A Fourth Star: Know Who and Whose YouAre</b></h2><br>Our divine origin and our eternal possibilities should determine our aspirations, our attitudes, and our actions. One of the great examples of this idea of identity determining destiny was displayed at the 1997 NCAA Cross Country Championships.<br><br>The national meet was held on a Monday, meaning that Sunday was the last day of preparation prior to the race. As other teams scouted the course, took training runs, stretched, and strategized, the BYU women's team attended church, hosted a fireside, and held a team testimony meeting. The Sabbath day was sacred, and they were not willing to compromise.<br><br>At their team meeting, one of the coaches read these prophetic words:<br><br><i>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i> [Isaiah 40:31]<br><br>Caisa Monahan, a five-foot three-inch ­sophomore from Hawaii, read the team a less-sacred text--the children's book <i>The Little Engine That Could,</i> pointing out that the Little Engine is the only train in the story that is blue.<br><br>At the racecourse the next day the team gathered in a circle, put their arms around each other, and prayed. On the tarp where they stored their bags, one of the team members had written, "We will win because we love each other, and because we love each other, we will do for each other what is too hard to do for ourselves."<br><br>When 184 of the nation's best cross-country runners were called to the starting line, seven of them were wearing Cougar Blue. The starter's gun fired. Each girl did what was needed. Each trusted in herself, in her teammates, in her coaches, and in God. When four runners were in for each team, the Cougars trailed undefeated Stanford, but there was still a chance depending on the placement of the fifth runner from each school.<br><br>In the last hundred meters of the 5K race, Caisa Monahan was inadvertently knocked to the ground. Her teammate Emily Nay sprinted past her to finish as the Cougars' fifth runner and lock in BYU's score. Now the championship depended solely on where Stanford's fifth runner placed.<br><br>Courageously, Caisa got back up and beat the Stanford girl to the finish line, displacing her by one spot to give BYU the victory by a score of 100 to 102. They became the first BYU women's team to claim an NCAA title, winning by the narrowest margin of victory in national cross-country history.<sup>11</sup><br><br>President Kevin J Worthen has invited us to climb mountains, both physical and spiritual, because he knows that part of the strength that is a mountain becomes ours as we ascend. As we follow his inspired counsel, our views become broader, we draw closer to the divine, and, like the mountains, we become steadfast and immovable.<br><br>It was on a high mountain that the prophet Moses learned who and whose he was. This mighty prophet whose teachings and ministry are seminal to the beliefs of three major world religions was powerfully taught, face to face, by God. The message was clear and repeated: You are my son; you are "in the similitude of mine Only Begotten," and "I have a work for thee" to do (Moses 1:6).<br><br>Couldn't the same be said of each one of us? I testify that it is true--that you are a son or daughter of our Heavenly Father; that you have traits, gifts, and callings that make you like the Savior; and that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have work for you to do.<br><br>Moses would later stand against the most powerful nation on earth, feed thousands in the wilderness, part the waters of the Red Sea, and lead his people to the Promised Land--all because he knew who and whose he was.<br><br>We come to BYU and attend church and read the scriptures not only to come to know about Christ but also to come to know Him. As we serve in our callings and our communities, we are given opportunities both to be like Him and to become better acquainted with Him. As King Benjamin stated, "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13). As we come to know who and whose we are, it becomes easier to sign our work with excellence and to see our efforts not only as part of a personal test but also as part of an eternal plan.<br><br>Thought to have made some of the greatest musical instruments ever created while living in Italy in the 1700s, Antonio Stradivari was a craftsman whose name became synonymous with his work. In her piece "Stradivarius," Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pen name George Eliot, imagined the self-defining drive that might have allowed Stradivari to create violins that would come to define who and whose he was:<br><br><i>"When any</i> [man] <i>holds,</i><br><i>'Twixt chin and hand a violin of mine,</i><br><i>He will be glad that Stradivari lived,</i><br><i>Made violins, and made them . . . the best.</i><br><i>The masters only know whose work is good:</i><br>[And] <i>they will chose mine,</i> [for] <i>while God gives them skill</i><br><i>I give them instruments to play upon,</i><br><i>God choosing me to help Him."</i><br><br><i> . . .</i><br><br>"[For even God Himself] <i>could not make</i><br><i>Antonio Stradivari's violins</i><br><i>Without Antonio."</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Individually and collectively our destiny lies in the ability to connect the points of light in our lives so that we can see the broad patterns of eternity. As we work hard, choose wisely, overcome opposition, and exercise faith in the Atonement and the plan of salvation, we will recognize that our destiny is not merely to gaze into the night sky but to create and organize the stars and to dwell eternally in the heavens.<br><br>The Savior Himself taught, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>May we truly come to know Them as we work and study and serve at BYU and beyond. May we live each day of life with gratitude, deciding what we will do with our short dash of mortality. May we weather the winds and survive life's inevitable storms with courage and perspective that is fueled by knowing with ever more certainty both who and whose we are. And may we continue to connect points of light in our lives, recognizing that they illuminate the pathway home.<br><br>In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael W.

<br>
When I tell people I am a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics and English Language, I am often asked, "How many languages do you speak?" Or they may react and say, "Oh, I'd better watch my grammar." While it is true that linguists study language, they study it in many different ways, not just by learning languages or by watching for grammar mistakes. I would like to give you a taste of what some of the linguists in our department and college do.<br><br>A few of my colleagues study and describe lesser-known languages--some that are spoken in North America, such as the Ute and Salish languages, along with other languages spoken around the world, such as Quichua, Xinkan, and Marshallese. Other colleagues study older forms of language, such as Old, Middle, and Early Modern English, with some examining how language has changed over time. Others investigate the language rules we are taught and which rules are useful to us today. One colleague studies how ambiguity in language--that is, how words or ­sentences can have more than one ­meaning--is applied in advertising. Others study how the pronunciation, words, and grammar of a language vary from one region or group to another. Another colleague has dedicated many years to researching the language in the Book of Mormon and constructing its original text. Some use technology to solve difficult and complex language problems. Others use databases containing millions of words to find language patterns, while others look for words and language patterns used by specific writers. Another group focuses on how languages are learned, particularly second languages, with some investigating the best ways to accurately measure proficiency in a language.<br><br>This research has been applied to a number of real-world problems by supporting language-preservation projects, creating language-frequency dictionaries and academic vocabulary lists, helping missionaries learn languages and assessing their progress, and extracting genealogical facts from texts in a fraction of the time it used to take.<br><br>These are just a few examples, but as you can see, there is much diversity in what my colleagues study; however, one thing they have in common is that they are passionate about and engaged in their research and teaching. While they have different stories of how they were led to study linguistics, they all have dedicated much of their time and effort to making their unique contributions to our field.<br><br>You do not have to be a linguist to be interested in language. You may have noticed differences in your own language or in others' language when you came here to BYU or as you have traveled to different places. Some of you may have taken surveys available online that sometimes quite accurately pinpoint the area of the country you are from. These surveys include questions about how you pronounce different words. How do you pronounce these words: <em>mountain, crayon, caramel</em>? Do you pronounce the <em>t</em> in <em>mountain</em>? Do you say "crey-ahn" or "crey-en" or "cren"? Do you say "care-a-mel" or "car-mel" or both depending on whether it is a candy or a topping? The surveys also often include questions about the words you use: What do you call the little bug that rolls into a ball? A roly poly, a potato bug, or something else? How do you refer to a group of people: "You all," "you guys," or "y'all"? We all have some differences in ourlanguage.<br><br>There is a natural tendency to describe these variations as being right or wrong; the majority of linguists I know, however, are more interested in describing or noting the differences without an evaluating judgment. For me, it is simply amazing to hear and see the many variations in language use.<br><br>Just as each of us is unique in our language use, we are also unique in our interests and in the gifts we bring to the area we choose to study, whether that be business, engineering, nursing, science, mathematics, humanities, education, or the arts. Just as my colleagues have done, use your gifts in whatever you choose to do; make your unique contribution. As I interact with students in my classes, in the office, and in other ways, I am filled with hope. I see students who are attentive in their studies, who are curious and excited about learning, and who want to apply what they learn to real-life settings. I see students who bring with them unique abilities and experiences. I believe I can say with confidence that we--that is, the faculty, staff, and administration at BYU--see your diligence, determination, and daring to bring about good in the world, and it fills us with hope for the present and for the future.<br><br>A short time ago my husband, Larry, and I went for a walk in our neighborhood park on one of those windy days we had in April. Several people were flying kites. They were multicolored kites that soared in the sky; some swayed back and forth, and one was so high you could barely see it. I thought about how we are like those kites, with the potential to soar in the sky and reach great heights. I thought of my colleagues and their contributions. I thought about my students and the great ­possibilities ahead of them.<br><br>Later I also thought about examples of people I have known or read about who, with their great capabilities, seem to have climbed out of sight, like a kite that has broken off from its string. Solely focused on accomplishing their goals, they became self-promoting, selfish, and willing to compromise standards to get what they wanted. Some may say that in these cases the ego takes over; King Benjamin called it "the natural man" (Mosiah 3:19). RobertL. Millet, who was a professor of ancient scripture at BYU, described the natural man thisway:<br><br><em>Acting without the Holy Ghost, the natural man can be proud, obsessed with self, overly competitive, reactionary, fiercely independent, driven by desires, appetites, worldly acclaim, orone who yields himself to the harsh and the crude.</em><sup>1</sup><br><br>At the other extreme, I thought about examples of people with great promise who have not reached their potential, like a kite that can't seem to get off the ground or that begins to rise only to fall back down. Sometimes this happens because of fear or because they may feel insignificant, discouraged, or anxious. For some reason they lack the confidence to fully accomplish what they are capable of doing or become who they are capable of becoming.<br><br>One way to counteract either of these potential pitfalls is to be anchored, like a kite is with its string. There are many ways we can be anchored, but let me suggest that one of the most powerful anchors is to know who you are. You are a spirit daughter or son of our Heavenly Father. Most of us here today know this. We have heard and sung the song "I Am a Child of God" for as long as we can remember. As young women we recited the words "We are daughters of our Heavenly Father, who loves us, and we love Him."<sup>2</sup> We read in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" that "all human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny."<sup>3</sup> This knowledge is not new to us. We are beings dual in nature: we are both physical beings as well as spiritual beings.<br><br>However, in order for this knowledge to provide an anchor for us, we need to not only know it in our minds but also understand it in our hearts and apply it in our lives each day. Some seem to have the gift of being able to do this with ease. For most of us, however, it takes time and practice to really connect to our true spiritual selves. It takes dedicated focus to make our way past the social masks we wear, the protective defenses we have put up, and the unproductive or negative thoughts in our minds. I encourage you to make every effort to connect with your true self--your spiritual self--for when you are securely anchored with this understanding, you can better negotiate this life in many ways.<br><br>I would like to focus on five ways that knowing our true selves will help us.<br><h2><b>Recognizing Our Potential</b></h2><br>When we understand who we are, we recognize our own potential. Our true selves are not fearful. The anxiety, the self-doubt, and the other beliefs that stem from our ­experiences--real as they are and important as they are to our mortal existence--are not part of the true self. While the trials and challenges we face may be difficult, we are taught that they are needed for our growth, just as a kite needs a strong opposing wind to soar. We can meet these challenges better, however, as we remember our true self, which has an eternal perspective. In a devotional address given at BYU in March 1999, Elder JefferyR. Holland said:<br><br><em>Paul said to those who thought a new testimony, a personal conversion, or a spiritual baptismal experience would put them beyond trouble, "Call to remembrance the former days, in which, </em><strong><em>after ye were illuminated,</em></strong> <em>ye endured a great fight of ­afflictions" (Hebrews 10:32; emphasis added).</em><br><br><em>Then came this tremendous counsel ... : </em><strong><em>Cast not away therefore your confidence,</em></strong> <em>which hath great recompence of reward.</em> <em>...</em> <em>[Hebrews 10:35 ...; emphasis added] ...</em><br><br><em>This opposition turns up almost anyplace something good has happened. It can happen when you are trying to get an education. It can hit you after your first month in your new mission field. It certainly happens in matters of love and marriage....</em><br><br><em>. . . Yes, there are cautions and considerations to make, but once there has been genuine illumination, beware the temptation to retreat from a good thing. If it was right when you prayed about it and trusted it and lived for it, it is right now. Don't give up when the pressure mounts. You can find an apartment. You can win over your mother-in-law. You can sell your harmonica and therein fund one more meal. It's been done before. Don't give in. </em><strong><em>Certainly don't give in to that being who is bent on the destruction of your happiness.</em></strong> <em>He wants everyone to be miserable like unto himself. Face your doubts. Master your fears. "Cast not away therefore your confidence." Stay the course and see the beauty of life unfold for you.</em><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland_cast-not-away-therefore-your-confidence/"><sup>4</sup></a><br><h2><b>Seeing Others' Potential</b></h2><br>When we understand who we are, we not only recognize our own potential but recognize that others are also spiritual beings with their own potential. We understand that all persons are of infinite worth and that we are not superior or inferior to anyone, no matter their circumstances--whether they are wealthy or poor, famous or unknown, sophisticated or simple, learned or uneducated; whether they have physical or mental disabilities; or whether they are just plain difficult to get along with or not. We respect all regardless of race, color, creed, cultural differences, educational differences, and behavior. When we see through the eyes of our true self, we see others as who they actually are--spiritual sons and daughters of God. When we understand who others are, we act differently toward them. We become more compassionate and try not to cause harm to them.<br><br>President ThomasS. Monson gave an example of a missionary who saw others in this way. He described a time when N.Eldon Tanner, who was then an assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve, had interviewed a successful missionary, asking him about what made him so effective.<br><br><em>The young man said that he attempted to baptize every person whom he met. He said that if he knocked on the door and saw a man smoking a cigar and dressed in old clothes and seemingly ­uninterested in anything--particularly religion--themissionary would picture in his own mind what that man would look like under a different set of circumstances. In his mind he would look at him as clean-shaven and wearing a white shirt and white trousers. And the missionary could see himself leading that man into the waters ofbaptism. He said, "When I look at someone that way, I have the capacity to bear my testimony to him in a way that can touch his heart."</em><br><br>President Monson went on to say:<br><br><em>We have the responsibility to look at our friends, our associates, our neighbors this way. Again, we have the responsibility to see individuals not as they are but rather as they can become. I would plead with you to think of them in this way.</em><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/see-others-as-they-may-become?lang=eng"><sup>5</sup></a><br><h2><b>Being Willing to Forgive</b></h2><br>When we understand who we are, we are willing to forgive. When someone wrongs us, intentionally or not, we may initially feel offended. However, carrying around a chip on our shoulder becomes a heavy burden to bear, and no one profits by it. With the understanding that we all are dual in nature and that at this moment perhaps the very imperfect, fallible part has taken center stage, we can take a step back, take time to pause, and reach inward to the true self and forgive others as well as ourselves. When conflicts arise, as they certainly will, we can take a moment to see through whatever is going on and see the other person as a son or daughter of God. What I am suggesting is that we look beyond the behavior. This doesn't mean that we allow others to take advantage of us or that we condone negative behavior, but it does mean that we give others the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf reiterated this idea when he said:<br><br><em>Each of us is under a divinely spoken obligation to reach out with pardon and mercy and to forgive one another. There is a great need for this Christlike attribute in our families, in our marriages, in our wards and stakes, in our communities, and in our nations.</em><br><br><em>We will receive the joy of forgiveness in our own lives when we are willing to extend that joy freely to others. Lip service is not enough. We need to purge our hearts and minds of feelings and thoughts of bitterness and let the light and the love of Christ enter in. As a result, the Spirit of the Lord will fill our souls with the joy accompanying divine peace ofconscience.</em><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/04/point-of-safe-return?lang=eng"><sup>6</sup></a><br><h2><b>Giving and Receiving Freely</b></h2><br>When we understand who we are, we give and receive freely. When Jesus was teaching the Twelve Apostles as they were about to go out and preach the gospel, He said, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). Because we understand that we are all spiritual beings, we freely give to others--not for recognition but because we know we are all connected as part of God's eternal plan. Probably the most lasting gifts are those we give of ourselves--our time, our talents, our love, and our appreciation. This idea is captured in one of Emily Dickinson's popular poems:<br><br><em>If I can stop one Heart from breaking</em><br><em>I shall not live in vain</em><br><em>If I can ease one Life the Aching</em><br><em>Or cool one Pain</em><br><em>Or help one fainting Robin</em><br><em>Unto his Nest again</em><br><em>I shall not live in Vain.</em><sup>7</sup><br><br>Not only do we give freely, but we also receive freely. We recognize the gifts we receive each day. We recognize the gifts from nature--a sunrise, a rain shower on a summer's day, or a blossom. We welcome gifts from others--a smile, a listening ear, or a shared experience. We receive these everyday gifts and recognize the abundance that surrounds us.<br><h2><b>Recognizing That Heavenly Father LovesUs</b></h2><br>Lastly, when we understand who we are, we recognize that our Heavenly Father loves us. We understand more fully the importance of the Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who opened the door so that we can live with our Father in Heaven again. How significant it is for us as spiritual beings to understand this gift, which increases the meaningfulness of these words from John 3:16: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<br><br>We understand these words from an eternal perspective, knowing that because of the sacrifice of our Savior, Jesus Christ, we can return again to the presence of our Heavenly Father. In the last general conference, Elder DavidA. Bednar said that having faith in Christ and understanding the power of the Atonement bring us hope. He continued by saying:<br><br><em>The peace Christ gives allows us to view mortality through the precious perspective of eternity and supplies a spiritual settledness ... that helps us maintain a consistent focus on our heavenly destination.</em><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/therefore-they-hushed-their-fears?lang=eng"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>We all have probably heard the quote "We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience."<sup>9</sup> By divine design this human experience carries with it challenges as we--imperfect beings that we are--struggle to negotiate these mortal experiences. However, as we gain an eternal perspective by connecting to our true selves, each mortal experience can become a spiritual experience.<br><br>I now return to our kite analogy: be anchored in order to soar. Although the words <em>anchor</em> and <em>soar</em> seem to be in direct contrast to each other, their combination brings great strength. I encourage you to take time each day to become securely anchored in the understanding that you are spiritual beings, sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father. At the same time, I encourage you to soar, to not be afraid to meet your full potential, and to seek out and make your unique contribution to humanity, whether that be as a CEO in a large company, the head of a small business, a scientist discovering new ways to combat diseases, a young mother struggling to best know how to teach her children who they are, a nurse, a writer, a counselor, or a musician. Understanding your true self allows you to see others as spiritual beings of great worth who you would not intentionally harm. It allows you to more easily forgive others and to give and receive. And, above all, it allows you to more fully appreciate the love of our Heavenly Father and the gift of the Atonement.<br><br>I bear testimony that Heavenly Father loves each of us; we are His children. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Diane Strong-Krause was chair of the BYU Linguistics and English Language Department when this devotional address was given on 2June2015.</em><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>tters: Living Joyfully Within Your Means - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am excited to be here today. I pray that the Spirit will bless us. The topic today is important, both temporally and spiritually, and I invite you to listen with both your mind and your heart.<br><br>Each year I teach almost a thousand BYU students in SFL (School of Family Life) 260 about family finance. Oddly enough, the purpose of this course is <i>not </i>to teach students how to get rich. Instead, the goal is to help students gain a stewardship perspective and wisely manage their money to joyfully strengthen family relationships. As a bonus, this class ­fulfills the quantitative reasoning general ­education requirement.<br><br>At the beginning of each semester I tell my class to remember three things, and I invite you to do the same:<br><br>First, life is hard, but you can do hard things. With the help of the Lord you can do anything He wants you to do--even balance abudget or invest in a mutual fund.<br><br>Second, when life doesn't go as planned, don't get frustrated; make the best of it. Most of the time things don't go as planned--­especially in financial matters--and if you don't make the best of it, you will spend most ofyour life feeling frustrated.<br><br>And third, remember TTT: things take time. In fact, the best financial plan is the "get rich slowly" plan in which you safely and systematically invest.<br><br>Whenever I talk about finances, I am reminded of a story I heard about a college freshman who didn't budget very well. He kept running out of money before he ran out ofmonth.<br><br>One night the student texted home: "No mon, no fun, your son."<br><br>His wise father texted right back: "How sad, too bad, your dad."<sup>1</sup><br><br>I hope my talk this morning will help you avoid the plight of this student.<br><br>The title of this devotional is "Money Matters: Living Joyfully Within Your Means." To introduce this theme, I would like to get personal and briefly share some things I have learned over my lifetime about money and ­joyful living.<br><br>A long, long time ago, Juanita Ray and I met while attending BYU. We played racquetball together, courted for a time, and were married in the temple. As newlyweds, we had no money. We lived in a tiny two-room apartment with low ceilings, we bought clothes from Deseret Industries, and we ate her family's food storage. We drank powdered milk for almost a year--yuck! But we had each other, we had our love, and we had the gospel. It was a good year. We learned that you don't need a lot of money to be happy.<br><br>I graduated, I got a good job, and we started drinking whole milk--heavenly! I had been taught to pay 10 percent to the Lord, save 10 percent to invest, and live on the rest. Juanita and I did this as we created our family budgets over the years. We were fruitful, and after twenty-five years we had lots of kids who filled our mortgage-free home. We also had solid investments. We learned about the miracle of compound interest: if you consistently save a little money and invest it in a broad stock market fund, that money naturally multiplies. Children and grandchildren also multiply.<br><br>Then came the hard part. Though Juanita and I were financially set for a long life together--and we anticipated many missions, lots of travel, and lots of grandkids--life didn't go as planned. Juanita got cancer. She fought valiantly, but cancer won. I learned that there are some things that matter much more than money, and I learned the hard way that "you can't take it with you."<br><br>After Juanita died, I was a lonely, single dad. I couldn't sleep. I got angry easily. I didn't eat well. To compensate, I wasted my money. I learned how foolish it is to spend money when you are hungry, angry, lonely, and tired.<br><br>Then a miracle happened. God sent me an amazing, beautiful widow named Tammy Mulford. It was so fun to be dating again (and to have money this time)! Tammy and I fell in love and were married. What pure joy--and what a good woman! It takes a remarkable person to marry a stuffy BYU professor with so many kids. Juanita and I are both eternally grateful to Tammy.<br><br>It is never easy to join two families, but Tammy and I have learned that money is ­useful when you are blending a large ­family, especially one with twelve children, six ­in-laws, and twenty-one grandchildren.<br><br>One final note: When the kids were older, Tammy took the initiative to go to graduate school. She now blesses many as an excellent marriage and family therapist and as an adjunct professor at BYU. Tammy's graduate education was only an option because we had the financial resources for her to do it. We learned that money makes important things possible.<br><br>That is my life story. Now let us get back to today's theme: "Money Matters: Living Joyfully Within Your Means." Finances can be perplexing for many of us, but this morning I hope to make them a little simpler. I will first briefly explore why money matters to families. Then I will share five practices to help you live within your means and thus claim blessings of joy. This is exciting--let's get started!<br><h2><b>Money Matters</b></h2><br>The choices we make with money are at the heart of mortality's test. Will we choose to waste our resources upon transitory pleasures, or will we choose to serve others and build up the kingdom of God? Will we choose to act on impulse and burden ourselves with debt, or will we act prudently so that money becomes a tool for family joy and not the cause of stress and worry?<br><br>Money matters to a husband and a wife and their marital relationship. Indeed, research shows that financial difficulties are often associated with marital stress<sup>2</sup> and even divorce.<sup>3</sup> Dr.Bernard Poduska reflected, "The saying 'until <i>debt </i>do us part' seems to reflect today's marital realities more accurately than does the traditional vow 'for better or worse.'"<sup>4</sup> A word of advice for those seeking an eternal mate (you know who you are): an important criterion for a future spouse is the way they handle money.<br><br>Money also matters to parents and children. "Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness,"<sup>5</sup> and this includes teaching their children about finances. Elder JosephB. Wirthlin taught:<br><br><i>Too many of our youth get into financial difficulty because they never learned proper principles of financial common sense at home. Teach your ­children while they are young.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>There are many ways parents can teach children about money. One practice our family adopted was to establish a family bank.<sup>7</sup> Until they graduate from high school, our children may invest their money in and borrow money from the family bank. Money invested earns 10 percent interest per month, compounded monthly. Wow! That's a good deal. Money borrowed costs 10 percent interest, compounded monthly. This arrangement quickly teaches our children that the smart decision is to save and earn interest and that the foolish decision is to borrow and pay interest.<br><br>Though money is important, we must view its purpose with an eternal perspective. Money is meant to be a <i>means</i> for serving our families and our God. When consecrated to that purpose, it is of great worth. However, when money becomes an <i>end</i> unto itself, it derails us from our eternal purposes. When we focus too much of our time, talents, and energy on making money, we sin. The apostle Paul taught that "the <i>love</i> of money is the root of all evil."<sup>8</sup><br><h2><b>Five Practices for Living Joyfully WithinYourMeans</b></h2><br>You have seen how money matters. Now let's look at living joyfully within your means. We must build our financial houses upon the rock of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Fortunately, our prophets, seers, and revelators--Christ's representatives on the earth--have given us clear financial guidance.<sup>9</sup> I have distilled five distinct themes from their messages over the years:<br><br>1. Create, use, and update a family budget.<br><br>2. Minimize and eventually eliminate debt.<br><br>3. Invest early, consistently, and wisely to build a financial reserve.<br><br>4. Don't do dumb things with your money!<br><br>5. Be generous and share your resources with others.<br><br>In a recent First Presidency message, President Thomas S. Monson taught these practices succinctly:<br><br><i> We encourage you </i>[to look] <i>to the condition of your finances. We urge you to ... discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from this bondage. Save a little money regularly to gradually build a financial reserve.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>And I imagine President Monson chuckled as he wrote:<br><br><i>Many more people could ride out the storm-tossed waves in their economic lives if they had a supply of food and clothing and were debt-free. Today we find that many have followed this counsel in reverse: they have a supply of debt and are food-free.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Let us examine more closely these five practices that can help you move toward living joyfully within your means.<br><h3><b><i>1. Create, Use, and Update a Family Budget</i></b></h3><br>Elder Robert D. Hales taught: "We help our children learn to be provident providers . . . by establishing a family budget. We should regularly review our family income, savings, and spending plan in family council meetings."<sup>12</sup><br><br>A budget is simply a plan for how you are going to spend the money that is available to you. Everyone, including you, should have a budget. To create a budget, you determine your spendable income and allocate it to different categories of expenses. Then you track your actual spending against your budget. A budget is a living document that is modified as conditions warrant. I suggest that every budget should allocate at least 10 percent to tithes and offerings, and most budgets should allocate at least 10 percent to long-term savings. You can find sample budgets on numerous Internet sites, such as the Marriott School's excellent site personalfinance.byu.edu<sup>13</sup> and lds.org,<sup>14</sup> as well as on many apps, such as Mint.<sup>15</sup> In my mind, the most overlooked budget category is "miscellaneous." Unexpected expenses always come up that don't fit neatly into your budget categories: perhaps a large car repair or, heaven forbid, a root canal--or, here at BYU, maybe an engagement ring.<br><br>In marriage relationships, both husband and wife should have a say in budget creation. In many marriages, one partner is a saver and the other partner is a spender. You might ask yourself which you are. Both play an important role in the marriage. Early in a marriage it is a great blessing when the saver can help the spender stay within the budget.<br><br>Elder RobertD. Hales poignantly illustrated this point in the following story:<br><br><i>We were newly married and had very little money. ... I saw a beautiful dress in a store window and suggested to my wife that if she liked it, we would buy it. Mary went into the dressing room of the store. After a moment the salesclerk came out, brushed by me, and returned the dress to its place in the store window. As we left the store, I asked, "What happened?" She replied, "It was a beautiful dress, but </i><b><i>we can't afford it!</i></b><i>" Those words went straight to my heart.</i><br><br>Elder Hales finished this story saying, "I have learned that the three most loving words are 'Ilove you,' and the four most caring words for those we love are 'We can't afford it.'"<sup>16</sup><br><br>The spender can also play an important role in the marriage. If, after a period of time, the family is doing well financially, the spender can take the lead in budgeting for some special expenditures that would strengthen relationships: perhaps a second honeymoon or a nice family vacation.<br><br>I invite each of you to create, use, and update some form of budget for the rest of your life.<br><h3><b><i>2. Minimize and Eventually Eliminate Debt</i></b></h3><br>President ThomasS. Monson recently quoted President J. Reuben Clark Jr. when hesaid:<br><br><i>Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it ... ; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, itcrushes you.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>So is any debt legitimate? The counsel of Church leaders on debt was summarized by Elder RobertD. Hales: "Some debt incurred for education, a modest home, or a basic automobile may be necessary to provide for a family."<sup>18</sup> I might add that necessary debt for a BYU education usually pays off quite well. A recent study revealed that the cost of a BYU education had the highest return on investment of any university in Utah.<sup>19</sup> Go, Cougars!<br><br>I would like to interject what I believe is the biggest financial mistake made by recent BYU graduates: buying a house that is beyond their means. There is a reason for this problem. When you apply for a mortgage loan, you are asked about your debts. Tithing represents a debt worth 10 percent of your income, reducing the amount you can afford for a house payment. Please treat 10 percent of your income as a debt when considering how much you can really afford to pay for a home.<br><br>If you already have debts, the key is to include a "debt repayment" category in your budget. The money allocated to this category should be applied as an extra payment each month to the debt with the highest interest rate until it is eliminated. Again, personalfinance.byu.edu has excellent advice on this topic.<br><br>The prophetic counsel is clear, but sometimes temptations are very challenging, even after being debt free for years. Let me confess and share another personal experience.<br><br>Tammy and I have committed to follow the prophet and live debt free and within our means. We don't have a mortgage or any other debt. We do make a car payment each month, but instead of paying a car dealership, we make a deposit into our own car savings account. A little while ago we took about four years of car savings and went shopping for a new car. We really liked a base model Toyota, and it fit our budget perfectly. We thought we were ready to buy, but then the salesman showed us the next model up. It was much nicer but was a little more than what we had saved. But then, and this was the temptation, we were led to a top-of-the-line model--a real dream machine.<br><br>Now, I have never been infatuated with cars, but driving that vehicle was a transcendent experience; it was so smooth and so powerful. I wanted it! I <i>really </i>wanted it, and Tammy wanted it too. We had just one problem: the car cost much more than what we had in our car savings. The sales person enthusiastically showed us that with our large down payment, our monthly car payment would be a pittance--very affordable! What would be wrong with a little debt if we could get what we wanted now? We wouldn't be irresponsible. We were sotempted!<br><br>Fortunately Tammy and I don't make a major financial decision on the spot. We talk about it, pray about it, sleep on it, and make the final decision when we're fresh and hopefully more inspired. So we went home and tried to talk ourselves into this brief excursion into debt. But alas, we didn't feel good about it, so we decided to wait.<br><br>When I told this story to my family finance class at BYU, one student asked, "Dr.Hill, why don't you just buy a used version of the car you want? It's better financially anyway." He was right. It is more economical to buy a used, low-mileage car than to buy a new car.<br><br>I got excited. Right after class I searched Carfax.com and found a beautiful car with low miles in Rexburg, Idaho, that fit our budget. My dad lives in Rexburg, so I asked him to take a test drive. He called back and said it was the best car he had ever driven and that if I didn't buy it, he would! I bought the car on the spot over the phone on the condition that my wife approved it--though I knew shewould.<br><br>Our anniversary was coming up, so I decided to surprise Tammy. I asked her to give me twenty-four hours to celebrate with a little getaway. We packed our bags and headed north on I-15. Tammy kept guessing where we were headed, and it is impossible to get anything over on Tammy, but this time I did. I just kept saying, "You'll just have to see where we're going, dear." She had no clue.<br><br>When we neared the car dealership, I said, "Let's just stop here for a minute." We walked into the showroom, and there was our gorgeous, new-looking used car draped in HappyAnniversary! balloons.<br><br>Tammy squealed in delight and nearly hyperventilated. A few seconds later she caught her breath and got concerned. She protested, "But, Jeff, we can't afford this." When she heard that we could pay cash for this used car, she hugged me, gave me a kiss, and said Iwas the smartest husband ever!<br><br>That is an experience I will always remember. I can honestly tell you that when you are true to a commitment to live debt free and within your means, you can live joyfully and claim blessings.<br><h3><b><i>3. Invest Early, Consistently, and Wisely toBuild a Financial Reserve</i></b></h3><br>Elder JoeJ. Christensen said in the April 1999 general conference:<br><br><i>There are those with average incomes who, over a lifetime, do amass some means, and there are those who receive large salaries who do not. What is the difference? It is simply spending less than they receive, saving along the way, and taking advantage of the power of compound interest.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Albert Einstein is thought to have said, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world." Let's consider an example of this wonder. Imagine that there are four twenty-year-old BYU students, each with $10,000 to invest now in preparation for retirement in 2065. Let's compare different investment options, assuming returns similar to the past few decades.<br><br>The first student does not trust the financial system, and he puts the money under his bed in a strongbox. In fifty years he still has $10,000.<br><br>The second student puts her money in a savings account, which averages about a 2.5 percent annual return. Because of compound interest, it doubles every twenty-five years. When she retires, she has $40,000.<br><br>The third puts his money in a safe government bond mutual fund, which averages about a 4.5 percent annual return. It doubles every fifteen years. By 2065 the $10,000 has become almost $100,000.<br><br>The fourth puts her money in a broad diversified stock market fund, which averages about a 10 percent return. It doubles every seven and a half years. In fifty years it doubles nearly seven times, and the $10,000 has become more than $1,000,000!<br><br>That is the miracle of compound interest. When you consistently invest like the fourth student, you have the peace of mind that comes from knowing you will be able to retire in the future and that if an emergency happens now, you have a reserve.<br><br>I invite my students, and I invite you, to begin to invest now. If you don't have much to invest, that's okay. You can start with as little as a one dollar a month automatic withdrawal from your checking account through some mutual funds that cater to the small investor.<sup>21</sup><br><br>In this regard, it is very important to remember that although money matters, it is simply a means to do something more important. Having a lot of money when you retire because you have made wise investments is meaningless in and of itself. Money only has value when it is used to do God's work with your family and elsewhere.<br><h3><b><i>4. Don't Do Dumb Things with Your Money!</i></b></h3><br>When dealing with money, use your common sense; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br><br>My first suggestion is to avoid speculation. Speculation is any investment that promises a greater-than-market-rate return. Most of these are scams or extremely high-risk ventures. In a letter from the First Presidency, members of the Church were warned about "those who use relationships of trust to promote risky or even fraudulent investment and business schemes."<sup>22</sup><br><br>I know of a young widow who invested part of the proceeds of her husband's life-insurance settlement with a close friend with the promise of a guaranteed high interest rate. Though the investment paid out for several years, one day the checks stopped coming. Soon thereafter, the company filed for bankruptcy, and the widow lost many tens of thousands of dollars. She felt betrayed that the sacred funds her late husband had provided were lost in this way.<br><br>It is important to realize that the only way to get greater-than-market-rate returns is to take greater-than-market-rate risks. This means that if you put money into investments that promise large returns--get-rich-quick schemes--you likely stand to lose much. It is much better to take the get-rich-slowly approach and invest wisely for the long term.<br><br>My next suggestion is to avoid home equity loans. When property values go down, home equity loans can leave you upside down in your home. This does not mean you are standing on your head in your living room; it means you cannot sell your home for what you owe on it. When that happens, you become a prisoner in your home because you can't sell it. Worse yet, many in this situation have lost their homes because they couldn't afford the payments when financial challenges occurred. Be very careful when considering a home equity loan.<br><br>Another suggestion is to avoid impulse purchases. I recommend you make a policy to never make a major purchase on the spot. Go home, have dinner, talk about it with your spouse or someone else you trust, pray about the decision, and decide later whether or not to make the purchase. You can remember this advice with the acronym HALT: don't make major purchases when you are <b>h</b>ungry, <b>a</b>ngry, <b>l</b>onely, or <b>t</b>ired.<br><h3><b><i>5. Be Generous and Share Your Resources withOthers</i></b></h3><br>The prophet Jacob provided some excellent counsel about riches and how they should be used:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the ­kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i> And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>We have a special responsibility to bless the poor with our resources. Elder JeffreyR. Holland eloquently taught that we are "to do what we can to deliver any we can from the poverty that holds them captive and destroys so many of their dreams."<sup>24</sup> Contributions to the Church beyond tithing can be helpful. Elder Holland also said, "Be as generous as circumstances permit in your fast offering and other humanitarian, educational, and missionary contributions."<sup>25</sup> There are also many ways to use your means in anonymous and ad hoc giving.<br><br>Here is one example: Tammy has taught me to be more generous when we go out to eat. She was a waitress earlier in life, so she is very aware of how much work servers do to make ends meet. She has encouraged me to stop being stingy and to be generous in my tipping. I have to tell you, it feels so good to give an unexpectedly large tip. I appreciate Tammy's generous spirit.<br><br>I invite you to be thoughtful and ­prayerful as you find ways to be generous and share your resources with others. I promise that you will feel joy as you do.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Let me conclude with a quote and my testimony. Elder RobertD. Hales taught:<br><br><i>We must practice the principles of provident ­living: </i><b><i>joyfully living within our means,</i></b><i> being ­content with what we have, avoiding excessive debt, and diligently saving and preparing for rainy-day emergencies.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>I have a testimony that when we understand that money matters and when we take the time to budget, eliminate debt, invest wisely, make smart financial decisions, and share our resources, we receive both material and spiritual blessings. I testify that we must build our financial homes upon the rock of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If we do this, when the rains of recessions descend, the floods of layoffs come, and the winds of high interest rates blow and beat upon our houses, our houses will not fall, for they will be founded upon the rock of Christ.<sup>27</sup> I invite you to live joyfully within your means for the rest of your life so that on Judgment Day you can give a good report of your earthly financial stewardship.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>E.

<h1>Your Fingers on the PULSE of Service - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The heart is a vital organ necessary to maintain life. The heart rate, also known as the pulse rate, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. In order for your body to function properly, it is important to have a continuous, regular, and strong pulse. With certain variations in the pulse, you may become sick and unable to function. Elder Marvin J. Ashton, in a general conference talk from October 1988, taught that the Lord measures an individual's heart as an indicator of that person's capacity and potential to bless others. In his words:<br><br><i>Why the heart? Because the heart is a synonym for one's entire makeup. We often use phrases about the heart to describe the total person. Thus, we describe people as being "big-hearted" or "goodhearted" or having a "heart of gold." Or we speak of people with faint hearts, wise hearts, pure hearts, willing hearts, deceitful hearts, conniving hearts, courageous hearts, cold hearts, hearts of stone, or selfish hearts.</i><br><br><i>The measure of our hearts is the measure of our total performance. As used by the Lord, the "heart" of a person describes his effort to better self, or others, or the conditions he confronts.</i> ["The Measure of Our Hearts," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1988, 15]<br><br>I recently saw a Facebook post from a wonderful friend who is a nursing student in Indiana. She had posted a video that had been presented by Dr. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, for his 2012 state-of-the-clinic address. The video really touched my heart and helped me to evaluate how I truly see and value others. I would like to share that video with you in the hope that it will do for you what it did for me and will start you thinking about the state of your heart. [A video was shown: <i>Empathy: The Human Connection to Patient Care,</i> youtube.com/watch?v=cDDWvj_q-o8.]<br><br>What if we could really see into each other'shearts? Would we understand each other better? By feeling what others feel, seeing what others see, and hearing what others hear, would we make, and take, the time to serve others, and would we treat them differently? Would we treat them with more patience, more kindness, and more tolerance?<br><br>A quote from Henry David Thoreau suggests that trying to see into each other's hearts could truly be something that could benefit our heart health: "Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?" (<i>Walden</i> [1854], I, "Economy").<br><br>While we may all look at things differently, our hearts beat with many of the same dreams. The 2015 Mutual theme, as found in Doctrine and Covenants 4:2, states:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i><br><br>This scripture teaches us that in order to stand blameless before God at the last day, not only should we serve Him with our might, mind, and strength, but it is also imperative that we serve Him with our heart. Our Heavenly Father and the Savior know our heart. Service with all of our heart must then be motivated by the pure love of Christ, free from all selfishness.<br><br>Since a strong and vibrant heart is vital to our physical and spiritual health, each of us needs to learn how to assess and monitor our own physical and spiritual heart rate. If you were one of our first-year nursing students, we would teach you how to take your own heart rate. This would be accomplished by taking your index and middle finger of either hand and placing them over the radial artery on the thumb side of your opposite wrist or by placing those same two fingers on the carotid artery on either side of your neck. By learning this simple technique, each of you could quickly and simply assess whether your ­physical heart was beating effectively.<br><br>Just as there is a necessity for each of us to know that our physical heart is functioning properly, it is equally important to know that our spiritual heart is healthy and functioning properly. Unfortunately, there is not a two-finger technique that I can teach you that will effectively assess and monitor your spiritual heart rate. But there are indicators from our daily life that help us to know where we stand spiritually. One of the most easily measurable of these indicators is our ability to help meet the physical and spiritual needs of others--or, in other words, our ability to be of service to those around us. And that is the topic I would like to address with you today.<br><br>I would like to suggest to you an acronym that will help you to assess, monitor, and improve your spiritual heart health. That acronym is PULSE, which is defined as follows:<br><br><b>P = </b>Pray: Pray to have a serving heart.<br><br><b>U = </b>Understand: Understand and recognize the needs of others.<br><br><b>L = </b>Lose: Lose yourself in the service of others.<br><br><b>S = </b>Spirit: Be Spirit driven--listen to and follow the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br><b>E = </b>Emulate: Emulate the Savior.<br><br>Let me now explore each of these with you in greater detail.<br><h2><b>First: Pray to Have a Serving Heart</b></h2><br>Heavenly Father knows each and every one of us. He knows our desires, unique abilities, and circumstances, and He knows how we can use them to bless others. As we pray, become closer to Him, and seek His direction, He will help us know who, where, and how best to serve.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard stated:<br><br><i>In your morning prayer each new day, ask Heavenly Father to guide you to recognize an opportunity to serve one of His precious children. Then go throughout the day with your heart full of faith and love, looking for someone to help. Stay focused, just like the honeybees focus on the flowers from which to gather nectar and pollen. If you do this, your spiritual sensitivities will be enlarged and you will discover opportunities to serve that you never before realized were possible.</i> ["Be Anxiously Engaged," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2012, 31]<br><br>President ThomasS. Monson has taught many times that Heavenly Father answers another person's prayers through us--through our acts of service and love.<br><br>Six months before my twenty-first birthday, my life was anything but hard. I had just finished my nursing prerequisites and had applied to the nursing program at the University of Utah; I had a super part-time job selling cosmetics for ZCMI, which included an hourly wage plus commission; I was seriously dating a young man and thinking I would be engaged in the not-too-distant future; and all was well with the world. And then my bishop, who just happened to be known as the "mission bishop" by the youth in our ward, called me in for an interview. My first thought was the obvious: he is going to ask me to go on a mission! And, sure enough, during the interview he encouraged me to put in my papers and go out and serve the Lord.<br><br>A mission was never part of my life's master plan, so I decided that I was not going to even consider the bishop's suggestion, nor was I even going to ask in prayer if that was what I needed to do. I didn't share this interview/request from the bishop with anyone--not my parents, not my closest friends, not anyone. I knew better than anyone else what course my life should take, and I didn't need anyone's help or advice!<br><br>Now, for those of you who have big grins on your faces and for others of you who are quietly chuckling to yourselves, you can see where all of this is headed--and you're absolutely right! When the other shoe finally dropped--and it did drop--it dropped with a loud bang! A mere few weeks after that initial interview, the young man I was dating stopped calling me without any explanation; the new manager where I was working decided she wanted everyone in that department to be full-time, and, since I was in school full-time and was not able to change my school schedule, I was moved to a less desirable area of the store and was no longer earning a commission from my sales; I was informed that I was not accepted into the nursing program; and the list went on and on. In a matter of months I felt like the whole world had come to an end.<br><br>President Era Taft Benson taught: "God willhave a humble people. Either we can choose to be humble or we can be compelled to be humble" ("Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign,</i> May1989,6).<br><br>Obviously I was not going to humble myself, so the Lord chose to do it for me.<br><br>It was at that moment in my life that I knew I needed to approach my Heavenly Father in prayer to plead for His forgiveness and ask what He would have me do. And I knew the minute that I asked, without a doubt, that I needed to serve a mission. By the way, from the moment the bishop asked me to serve a mission, I knew what it was that I was supposed to do, but I didn't want to pray about it because I knew that if I did, I wouldn't be able to ignore the answer and do what I thought was best for me. If I didn't ask, then I could simply go on as I had been and not have to worry about making dramatic changes to my master plan for my life. What I have since come to realize is that the real master plan for my life was, and is, really in the hands of the Master.<br><br>The time between when the bishop first interviewed me to the time when I entered the MTC here in Provo was a little over seven months. I served a full-time welfare service mission to the Asunción Paraguay Mission, speaking Spanish. Little did I realize what the Lord had in store for me in the future because I had been willing to replace my plan with His and to serve Him in the way that He intended.<br><h2><b>Second: Understand and Recognize the Needs of Others</b></h2><br>Sister Linda K. Burton gave a talk in the October 2012 general conference in which she suggested that in order for us to become more like the Savior as we serve, we need to remember a four-word phrase: "First observe, then serve" ("First Observe, Then Serve," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2012, 78).<br><br>I have found in my own experience that the more I observe, talk to, interact with, and take an interest in the lives of others, the better I come to know others' likes, dislikes, needs, and wants. Information can truly lead to inspiration. Serving others becomes easier because I better understand where they are and what they really need. This understanding leads to a greater desire on my part to make an effort to reach out and bless the lives of those within my sphere of influence.<br><br>In the College of Nursing we have a required global health course that is taken after the students have completed either their fourth or fifth semester in the program. I have the opportunity each May to take between fourteen and twenty nursing students to Ecuador in fulfillment of that global health requirement. While there, we have the opportunity to work with various nonprofit organizations. The more I go the more I am able to talk with those leaders and the people of Ecuador to evaluate their needs and in turn share those needs with the students. With the nonprofit organization Charity Anywhere, we are able to take teams made up of physicians, dentists, and an eye specialist into various communities and schools in the Otavalo and Tena areas of Ecuador. There we evaluate and serve the medical and dental needs of children and their parents. We also do classroom teaching and provide fluoride treatments to all of the children.<br><br>In Guayaquil we have worked with a nonprofit organization called Hogar de Cristo. This organization works with an impoverished area of approximately 400,000 people--some of them living on less than a dollar a day. A few years ago the leaders of Hogar de Cristo were concerned about many hungry children coming to school and were worried that these children were not growing as they should. One year they asked if my students would measure these children, as they wanted to start some school nutrition interventions. We measured height, weight, and hemoglobin and found that nearly 50 percent of the children had anemia. Since that time, we in the nursing program have worked together with Hogar deCristo and the BYU Department of Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Science to find a sustainable way to decrease the rate of anemia in Guayaquil--a study and intervention that is still in progress.<br><br>Luis Tavara, a representative of Hogar de Cristo in Guayaquil, always talks with the nursing students at an initial orientation. He tells them to "turn off the noises of the world in order to better see ways to reach out and serve." He also encourages them that "through the smiles in their eyes the children will feel hope." These words have had a long-lasting effect on many of the nursing students who have gone to Ecuador. One student said:<br><br><i>Even now when I am home, I continue to apply this principle every day in my life with each new or familiar person I come in contact with. I feel like this principle will make a huge difference in the nursing care that I will provide in my future. No matter the culture, economic status, religion, or personality of my patients, a "smile from the soul" truly is the greatest thing I can give them.</i> [Anna Mocke, 2015 Public and Global Health Ecuador course]<br><br>Throughout Ecuador we have held many LDS stake health fairs at the local meetinghouses and have been able to interact with large numbers of the members of the Church to do health screenings to measure height, weight, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. We have taught various health care topics such as cardio­pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the Heimlich maneuver, proper practices of nutrition, how to stay healthy, and the prevention and treatment of diabetes and hypertension.<br><br>Each year our BYU Student Nurses' Association and BYU nursing alumni come together to assemble kits to share with those in need. These include newborn kits, first-aid kits, hygiene kits, school kits, dental hygiene kits, and feminine hygiene kits. There have been so many people who have donated their time and money in order to provide the supplies for these kits, and, in turn, so many people in various countries have benefited from this service.<br><br>Each year as I take nursing students to Ecuador, we are able to continue to observe in order to be better able to serve.<br><h2><b>Third: Lose Yourself in the Service of Others</b></h2><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>Generally speaking, the most miserable people I know are those who are obsessed with themselves; the happiest people I know are those who lose themselves in the service of others. ...</i><br><br><i>... By and large, I have come to see that if we complain about life, it is because we are thinking only of ourselves.</i> ["Whosoever Will Save His Life," <i>Ensign,</i> August 1982, 5]<br><br>I had the wonderful opportunity to serve as our ward girls camp director this year. Two weeks ago I was at girls camp in Wallsburg, Utah, with our Young Women and their advisors. Sister Virginia H. Pearce was one of our nightly devotional speakers, and she taught us about "becoming." One of her statements about becoming was, "Be someone who reaches out to know and serve others--throw away the mirrors and look through the window."<br><br>To demonstrate this, she called up one of the young women and asked that young woman to stand facing her. Sister Pearce then pulled out a mirror and put it between the young woman and herself so that she, Sister Pearce, was looking into the mirror while she tried to talk with the young woman. Not surprisingly, it didn't even begin to be an effective or heartfelt conversation. This was a powerful object lesson that illustrated how difficult it is to communicate with and serve others if we are too worried about ourselves and see only ourselves and our needs. Sister Pearce then put away the mirror, pulled out a window frame, and put it between her face and the young woman's face. As she did so, we were able to see that the young woman had become Sister Pearce's focal point and that true service requires that we focus on the needs and emotions of others. Ofttimes we are so worried about ourselves and our own busy lives--as we look in mirrors while trying to look for opportunities to serve--that we do not see clearly through the windows of service.<br><br>In October 2009 general conference, President Monson stated:<br><br><i>Often we live side by side but do not communicate heart to heart. ...</i><br><br><i>... How often have you </i><b><i>intended</i></b><i> to be the one to help? And yet how often has day-to-day living interfered and you've left it for others to help, feeling that "oh, surely someone will take care of that need."</i><br><br><i>We become so caught up in the busyness of our lives. Were we to step back, however, and take a good look at what we're doing, we may find that we have immersed ourselves in the "thick of thin things." In other words, too often we spend most of our time taking care of the things which do not really matter much at all in the grand scheme of things, neglecting those more important causes.</i> ["What Have I Done for Someone Today?" <i>Ensign,</i> November 2009, 85; emphasis in original]<br><br>President Monson also has said:<br><br><i>We are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness. ... We are the Lord's hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us.</i> ["What Have I Done?" 86]<br><br>I have been very fortunate throughout my life to have a profession whose very purpose is service and gives me the opportunity of serving others daily. Everyone who comes to a medical facility is in need of being served in some way. Many days I would think to myself how awesome it was to not only be able to go to work and serve others but to also have that as my profession. It has truly been an amazing and fulfilling journey. I have worked in clinical settings as an emergency nurse and now as a nurse practitioner in urgent-care clinics, and what I have learned there I am now able to pass on as I teach nursing students the importance of serving others and treating each person with kindness and respect.<br><br>The inscription we read as we enter the BYU campus--which pertains to all of us--is "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." How awesome it is that every day I have worked has been a day of service! I would hope I could say that of all of the days that I am not working as well.<br><h2><b>Fourth: Be Spirit Driven--Listen to and Follow the Promptings of the Spirit</b></h2><br>Listen to the Spirit--He knows the heart ofeveryone--and trust Him. Elder M. Russell Ballard stated that<br><br><i>if you do this--at home, at school, at work, and at church--the Spirit will guide you, and you will be able to discern those in need of a particular ­service that only you may be able to give. You will be prompted by the Spirit and magnificently motivated to help pollinate the world with the pure love of Christ and His gospel.</i> ["Be Anxiously Engaged," 31]<br><br>One of my favorite scriptures is found in Proverbs 3:5–6, which reads:<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i><br><br>It is very obvious to me that the opportunity to be influenced by the Spirit and to serve a mission more than thirty years ago has led me to my current experience of now serving in Ecuador with nursing students. Because the Lord altered events in my life and led me to a place where I needed to speak Spanish and understand South American culture, He is now able to use me for His purposes. By listening to the Spirit, putting my trust in the Lord, and planning according to His will, I am able to find joy and fulfillment in serving the Ecuadorian people.<br><br>Also, in listening to the Spirit and trusting the Lord in choosing nursing as my profession thirty years ago, I have been greatly blessed as I have been able to care for the diverse medical needs of my family, friends, and neighbors. A few weeks ago the whisperings of the Spirit led me to pick up on early signs of pneumonia and sepsis that were affecting my father as we came back from one of his weekly dialysis sessions and to get him to the hospital--a course of action that led to the early intervention that he needed to stave off a much more severe and possibly life-threatening set of circumstances.<br><br>As a nursing professor here at BYU, I am now able to impart to my nursing students the importance of trusting the Lord and listening to and following the promptings of the Spirit throughout their careers--just as I have been given those same opportunities throughout mine.<br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball said:<br><br><i> God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom.</i> ["Small Acts of Service," <i>Ensign,</i> December 1974, 5; quoted in <i>Teachings of Presidents of the Church: SpencerW. Kimball</i> (2006), 82]<br><h2><b>Fifth: Emulate the Savior</b></h2><br>All of the prophets have declared that true happiness is found in following the example and teachings of Jesus Christ. He is the perfect example, as His was a life of service. When we serve our family, friends, and neighbors, we help those who are in need. As we emulate the Savior, we become more like Him. The Savior has given us an entire life of service to emulate, including healing the sick and ministering to the afflicted as well as causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, and the deaf to hear. He miraculously fed those who had no food; He raised the dead; and He took time for those in need, maybe even when He had not planned it into His day.<br><br>In April 2011 general conference, Elder Ballard shared some thoughts about serving asthe Savior serves:<br><br><i>"Jesus said ... , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>"This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as </i><i>thyself" (Matthew 22:36–40).</i><br><br><i>It is only when we love God and Christ with all of our hearts, souls, and minds that we are able to share this love with our neighbors through acts of kindness and service--the way that the Savior would love and serve all of us if He were among ustoday.</i><br><br><i>When this pure love of Christ--or ­charity--envelops us, we think, feel, and act more like Heavenly Father and Jesus would think, feel, and act. Our motivation and heartfelt desire are like unto that of the Savior.</i> ["Finding Joy Through Loving Service," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2011, 46–47]<br><br>One of my students this year wrote:<br><br><i>Serving the people in Ecuador also helped my understanding of Christ's role as a healer. When we think of Christ as a healer, we often think of all of the miracles He performed throughout His life on earth: healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead. However, this is not all that Christ is capable of as a healer. He is able to lift up the heads that hang down and heal broken hearts and wounded souls. This type of healing was what Ifelt we were able to participate in while in Ecuador. We may not have been able to heal every one of their physical infirmities, but we could help lift up heads that hung down, boost spirits, and heal hearts by providing a listening ear, a comforting hug, or a word of encouragement. All of these types of healing are accomplished by love. This experience in Ecuador helped me better understand how we can love as Christ did to help heal.</i> [Stephanie Squire, 2015 Public and Global Health Ecuador course]<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>When I think of the Savior, I often picture Him with hands outstretched, reaching out to comfort, heal, bless, and love. ...</i><br><br><i>As we emulate His perfect example, our hands can become His hands; our eyes, His eyes; our heart, His heart.</i> ["You Are My Hands," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2010, 68]<br><br>If we truly love and look to the Savior and try to emulate His life of service, we will more fully know how to best serve our fellowman.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I would ask you to ask yourself if you have a healthy heart with a continuous, strong, and regular pulse for service. If the answer is yes, then I would encourage you to keep praying for and making time to be of daily service. If, on the other hand, your heartbeat is a bit faint and your service pulse rate is a bit hard to effectively measure, I would ­suggest incorporating the PULSE acronym more fully into your daily life:<br><br><b>P</b>ray for a serving heart.<br><br><b>U</b>nderstand and recognize the needs of others.<br><br><b>L</b>ose yourself in the service of others.<br><br>Be <b>S</b>pirit driven--listen to and ­follow the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br><b>E</b>mulate the Savior.<br><br>I am grateful for the opportunity to be in the service profession of nursing with the opportunity to serve my brothers and sisters here on the earth. I love "be[ing] anxiously engaged in a good cause" (D&amp;amp;C 58:27), and I am grateful to be an instrument in His hands and pray that I will be ready when, where, and how He needs me, as I would hope you would be as well. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sondra D. Heaston was an associate teaching ­professor in the BYU College of Nursing when thisdevotional address was given on 23 June 2015.</i>

<h1>ve Up on Your Testimony of the Gospel - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Worthen, for the nice introduction. President Worthen mentioned that I graduated from the University of Utah. If that fact troubles any of you because of the long-standing sports rivalry, let me put your mind at ease. I recently received a very nice thank-you note from a graduating student. After saying lots of nice things, he concluded his note by saying, "Despite the fact that you graduated from the U, I think you're a great guy." So don't worry: I am a great guy, and I am thrilled to be here at BYU with so many great students and colleagues. I hope each of you feels that way too.<br><h2><b>The World Is a Dangerous Place</b></h2><br>Last week I had a great time with my son Tate and the rest of the priests and teachers from our ward on their annual high adventure trip. Among other things, we kayaked on the Green River and mountain biked in the La Sal Mountains. One of the highlights of the trip was rappelling down a 175-foot cliff below a double arch. Don't get the wrong impression; I am not a great adventurer and I am definitely not an experienced climber. I have always had a fear of heights, and before last week I had never rappelled. As I started the descent, the engineer in me started to think about how ropes can fray and carabiners can break. I know my fears were irrational, but there is some inherent danger in rappelling. Maybe a little healthy fear is a good thing if it helps me stay safe.<br><br>Rappelling isn't the only dangerous thing in the world. In fact, the world is basically a dangerous place. Here are some numbers from an article I read some years ago that illustrate what I mean:<br><ul><br> 	<li>You have a one in 11 million risk of dying from an earthquake or volcano.</li><br> 	<li>There is a one in 12 million chance you will die from leaking gas.</li><br> 	<li>You have a one in 6 million probability of being injured in an elevator ride.</li><br> 	<li>There is a one in 23 million chance that you will die from drinking detergent.</li><br> 	<li>Your risk of being infected with flesh-eating bacteria is one in 170,000.</li><br> 	<li>You have a one in 11,000 chance of being murdered, a one in 400 chance of being robbed, and a one in fifty chance of being burglarized.</li><br> 	<li>Certain risks depend on where you are born. For example, in the United States you have a one in 100 chance of dying before the age of five. In South Asia, on the other hand, you have one chance in eight.</li><br> 	<li>Other risks have to do with whether you are a man or a woman. For example, men are 2.3 times as likely to die in a car crash and 3.3 times as likely to accidentally ­poison themselves than are women.</li><br> 	<li>Women in the United States, on the other hand, have a one in 12,500 chance of dying in childbirth.</li><br> 	<li>I'm sure some of you have wondered this: what are your chances of being struck by lightning this year? The answer is one in 750,000.</li><br> 	<li>And, finally, a piece of good news: What are the odds that you will be hit by a meteor? Only one in 150 trillion.<sup>1</sup></li><br> 	<li>The dangers are real, and they make me worry. Anyone who has sent a daughter to her first day of school, dropped a son off at Scout camp, or given the car keys to their teenager for the first time knows what I am talking about. In preparation for all the dangers in the world, I want to sit my children down and tell them to look both ways before crossing the street and to chew their food carefully. I want to warn them to always wear their seatbelts and to check their blind spot. I want to tell them to not talk to strangers and to avoid volcanoes. I want to urge them to play tennis instead of football. I want to warn them of the danger of drinking detergent.</li><br></ul><br>There is one danger that is not listed here that worries me most of all. I would like to talk about it today.<br><h2><b>The Great Danger</b></h2><br>A few years ago one of my colleagues came to my office to tell me some sad news about a mutual friend. He told me that our friend had chosen to leave the Church because he no longer believed it was true. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My friend was a strong member of the Church, a returned missionary, a well-educated person from a good family, and someone who had served in positions of responsibility in the Church. And he was throwing away something that used to be ­precious to him.<br><br>I was surprised by how hard I took the news. I was shocked and saddened, and my mind kept returning to my friend and his family. I wondered how this could have happened. How was it possible that someone who at one point had a bright testimony of the gospel and had shared it with others was leaving the Church because that testimony was gone? In my mind it was a tragedy, and it affected me deeply. I am sure some of you have been deeply affected as someone close to you has lost their way and their faith.<br><br>This is the danger that I worry about: losing one's testimony, whether through a crisis of faith or through a slow, subtle decline. Closely related to it is the danger of "just getting by" with a testimony that is inadequate or incomplete. I know that each of you will undoubtedly face challenges to your testimony, and thedanger is very real.<br><br>Although I view what happened to my friend and to others like him as a tragedy, this experience has resulted in one positive outcome for me. It has made me think about my own testimony and reexamine what I believe. I have looked carefully at what I am doing to keep and strengthen my testimony, and I have made changes. The result has been great. As I have done those things that I know I must do to gain the kind of testimony that I want, I have felt the Savior's love for me, and my testimony of Him and of the restored gospel has grown. My knowledge is still imperfect and incomplete, but it has been exciting to feel it grow from something that was good into something that is much better.<br><br>What I want to share today is not just for those whose testimonies are at the point where they are considering leaving the Church or have already decided to do so. I assume that most people listening today are not in that category, but maybe some are. I also want to direct my comments to those whose testimonies are not as strong as they should be or want them to be; to those who struggle with doubt or wonder about certain doctrines; to those whose questions prevent them from being able to declare with confidence that they know the Church is true; to those who go through the motions of Church membership for family or cultural reasons but haven't felt the warmth of a testimony for some time; and to those who maybe find their belief and faith slowly drifting away and want to have them back. My thoughts today are also for those people who, like me, want their testimony to be stronger and want to avoid the danger of letting it die.<br><h2><b>Fight for It</b></h2><br>If I had to summarize in one sentence the key to keeping and strengthening your testimony, it would be this: You have to fight for your testimony.<br><br>There are many things we are willing to fight for. Who has been willing to go to battle, figuratively, for something they wanted badly? Who has put in long hours of hard study to get a needed grade on a final exam? Who has practiced diligently and passionately to master a sport or a musical instrument? Who would put up a fight if someone were trying to steal something of value from them?<br><br>Your testimony is your most valuable possession, and someone <i>is</i> trying to steal it from you. Can you imagine what your testimony would be like if you fought for it with the same tenacity with which you fight for other things in life?<br><br>I think there are two reasons why you need to fight for your testimony. First, you show your Father in Heaven how much you value your testimony and that you want to keep it. I believe He is more eager to give the gift of testimony to those He knows will cherish it, protect it, and fight for it.<br><br>The second reason is that those things that constitute a good fight are also the things that will naturally result in a stronger testimony. I am talking about prayer, study, fasting, and all of the tools that we already know to be key to gaining faith and knowledge. We all know that we need to be doing these things, but when it comes to growing our testimonies, it is not enough to just do them; we need to do them with purpose and focus and consistency. Doing them casually is not nearly enough when a testimony is in danger. If you are struggling with your faith and are not receiving the testimony that you want--despite prayer, study, and fasting--I urge you to not give up. Do these things with renewed vigor. Make it a true fight. I feel very strongly that our Father in Heaven will reward those who fight for their testimony.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, who has said many great things about faith and testimonies, said, "In moments of fear or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited." He went on to say, "Hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/lord-i-believe?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a> Fight for the testimony that you have, and your testimony will grow.<br><h2><b>There Is Only One Source of a True Testimony</b></h2><br>The next key should be obvious to everyone: our Heavenly Father, through the Holy Ghost, is the only source of a true testimony. Moroni promised that after doing your part to obtain a testimony, Christ "will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:4–5). No matter how impressive your learning, mastery of the scriptures, life experience, or logic and reason, only the Holy Ghost can impart the kind of testimony that lasts. You need to turn to God for confirmation of the truth.<br><h2><b>There Are Many Sources of Falsehood</b></h2><br>There is a corollary to that last statement: although there is only one source of a true testimony, there are many sources of falsehood.<br><br>About eleven years ago our twins, Max and Mia, were two years old and we were living in an apartment while I was in graduate school. To my wife's horror we discovered that there was a mouse in our apartment. We bought a mousetrap, put some peanut butter on it, and placed it next to a baseboard on the kitchen floor where we had seen the mouse. Two-year-olds and mousetraps don't coexist very well, so we took Max and Mia into the kitchen, pointed out the mousetrap, and explained to them how dangerous it was. We told them to stay away from it, to keep their fingers out, and that it would hurt them. We even used our scary voices: "No. Don't touch. Danger." A couple of days later, while most of us were sitting on the couch in the other room, we heard a snap and then a scream. We hurried into the kitchen and found little Mia with her fingers in the trap and peanut butter on her lips.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, there are many sources of falsehood in the world. Please don't put your fingers in those traps. Don't turn to them in your quest for a testimony. There have been, and always will be, intelligent and articulate people in the world who will try to convince you that the Church is not true, that God does not exist, and that anyone who believes that there is a God is foolish and naïve. Don't go to those sources. Don't turn to people on the Internet who are seeking to destroy your testimony. Like with our twins, I want to point at those traps and tell you how dangerous they are. I want to tell you to stay away from them, to keep your fingers out, and that they will hurt you. I want to use my scary voice: "No. Don't touch. Danger."<br><br>You would never turn to an engineering textbook to learn accounting or play basketball to prepare for a final exam. It just doesn't make sense. Turning to other sources for understanding or to gain a testimony makes even less sense. Don't do it. It will open the door to deception and confusion.<br><br>Some may think that if the Church is true then their testimony should be able to stand up to anything that people can write about the Church on the Internet. Others might claim that we are told not to read such things because the Church has something to hide. These claims just aren't true. It has never been a question of whether the Church is true or has something to hide; it is about the cleverness and subtlety of the adversary and his ability to deceive and confuse. He teams up with clever people who are very convincing. Together they always find exactly the right wedge to drive into the cracks in your faith. Please don't put your fingers in those traps.<br><h2><b>Choose to Believe</b></h2><br>The next key to getting the type of testimony that you want is to choose to believe. Elder L.Whitney Clayton stated, "The decision to believe is the most important choice we ever make."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/04/choose-to-believe?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a> Some may say that this is a naïve approach to finding truth and that choosing to believe something won't make it true. But that is not what we are asked to do. We know that choosing to believe is the <i>first step</i> toward knowing if something is true. The prophet Alma taught that we need to "exercise a particle of faith," "desire to believe," and let the desire work in us until we truly believe (Alma 32:27).<br><br>Elder Clayton emphasized the importance of choosing to believe. He said:<br><br><i> Belief and testimony and faith are not passive principles. They do not just happen to us. Belief is something we choose--we hope for it, we work for it, and we sacrifice for it. We will not accidentally come to believe in the Savior and His gospel any more than we will accidentally pray or pay tithing. We actively choose to believe, just like we choose tokeep other commandments.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>As part of choosing to believe, you need to suspend your doubts so that your faith and your testimony have a chance to grow. I am not saying that you need to pretend that your doubts or questions don't exist; you just need to move them far enough to the side to be able to, as Alma said, "give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart" (Alma 32:28). As the seed grows into a strong testimony, your doubts and concerns will be pushed further and further to the side. They may not immediately go away, but the strength of your belief will render them insignificant until the day when all doubts and questions will be resolved.<br><h2><b>Don't Let Unanswered QuestionsUndermine Your Faith</b></h2><br>We all have questions in life, many of which are unanswered. The next key to keeping your testimony strong is to not let those unanswered questions undermine your faith<i>.</i> When the friend I spoke about left the Church, one of the reasons he gave for not believing that the Church is true is that "the data don't support it." We naturally want to understand how everything fits together, how science and religion agree, or how Church history and secular history match up. We want facts. We want proof. We want data. I understand. I consider myself a scientific guy. I want to understand how it all works. But I can't let what I don't know destroy what I do know. My scientific side, as important as it is, can't dominate my spiritual side.<br><br>Regarding questions of faith, Elder Holland said, "In this Church, what we know will always trump what we do not know. And remember, in this world, everyone is to walk by faith."<sup>5</sup> This statement tells us two things: first, we do know quite a bit about how things fit together, and second, for those things that we do not know, we are just going to have to get by on faith. This does not mean that we should stop thinking deeply and asking difficult questions. It is important for us to continue to ask questions, but we must do it using the enabling power of faith, assuming that answers will come, rather than under the stifling influence of doubt. I firmly believe that eventually all questions of science, religion, and history will be answered in full.<br><br>Sometimes I draw strength from the fact that there are a lot of intelligent, educated people who have amazing testimonies of the Savior and the restored gospel. I think of the testimonies of President HenryB. Eyring, Elder DallinH. Oaks, and Elder RussellM. Nelson. They are educated, intelligent, and successful men, and they believe. I think of the testimonies of my friends, colleagues, and family. These people are smarter than I am, and they believe. I think about President Eyring's father, one of the most important theoretical chemists of the twentieth century. He believed. He also nicely summarized the issue when he said:<br><br><i> Some have asked me, "Is there any conflict between science and religion?" There is no conflict in the mind of God, but often there is conflict in the minds of men. Through the eternities, we are going to get closer and closer to understanding the mind of God; then the conflicts will disappear.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Remember that there are answers and there are reasons. God knows them and will help you understand them if you don't let the unanswered questions undermine your faith.<br><h2><b>Experiment Upon the Word</b></h2><br>The next key is to follow Alma's counsel to experiment upon the word. In science and engineering fields, experiments are essential. Scientists perform experiments to understand phenomena, to test hypotheses, and to validate theoretical models. Experiments are designed to answer important questions.<br><br>Some of my best friends are scientists. Dave Thomson, in the Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, conducts experiments that test whether caffeine affects the ability of skeletal muscle to grow when it is stressed. Matt Seeley, in the Department of Exercise Sciences, has conducted experiments in which he injects saline into a person's knee to cause pain and then measures the change in the person's gait in response to the pain. Without conducting these experiments, these men would never be able to know the answers to their questions.<br><br>My colleagues and I study how people interact with robots. In a recent project we worked with students and faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Communication Disorders to explore how therapists can use robots to help children with autism. The therapists used a robot to engage the children in games, sharing activities, and songs with actions, such as "Popcorn Popping." Although our results were not perfect, we found that for some children with autism, using robots can help them make improvements in important social behaviors.<sup>7</sup><br><br>What if we had dreamed up a robot but had never built it to see how it worked? Or what if we had built the robot but had never let the therapists use it in the clinic? Our work would have been useless. You can read all you want about a topic, you can think carefully about a research question, you can look at the theory and develop mathematical models, and you can even look at other people's research, but until you try something out--until you get your hands dirty in actual experiments--you will never get a definitive answer for yourself.<br><br>The same is true for obtaining and keeping a testimony of the gospel: you need to experiment upon the word. Only by getting your hands dirty can you get a definitive answer for yourself. In the Book of Mormon Alma told of the Lord's way of experimenting: you must desire to have a testimony, you must exercise what faith you have (even if it is very little), you must do those things that will make your faith grow, and then you must watch carefully to see if it grows (see Alma 32:27–33).<br><h2><b>Experiments Are Hard</b></h2><br>There is a problem: whether they are scientific or spiritual experiments, experiments are hard. They are so much work! It seems, at least initially, that they never go exactly as we plan. Sometimes this is because we are asking the wrong questions. Sometimes we are not following the correct procedure. Sometimes we are not patient enough, and we miss out on the beautiful results that would have come had we stuck with the experiment a little longer. Sometimes we need to repeat the experiment.<br><br>I teach a class called mechatronics that culminates in teams of students building and programming small robots to compete against other teams' robots. This class is a lot of fun, but it can also be really frustrating. One of the frustrating things about it is the attention to detail that is required for circuits, motors, and sensors to actually work. Here is a common scenario in the mechatronics class: A student will come to me and tell me that a circuit he built is not working, even though he connected everything <i>exactly</i> like he was supposed to. We then proceed to figure out what is wrong, checking all of the connections in the circuit. At a certain point I will ask, "Did you connect the ______ to the ______?" He will say that he did not, because that connection didn't seem critical. I will point out that the datasheet (aset of instructions for the circuit) says that that connection needs to be made. It is not an optional connection, and the circuit probably won't work without it.<br><br>When it comes to experimenting upon the word to gain a testimony, you need to conduct the experiments in the Lord's way. You need to complete all the required steps and make all the necessary connections to be successful. These steps include study, faith, prayer, and fasting. There is no other way to gain a testimony. If you leave one of the steps out, you can't reasonably expect to gain the testimony that you want. It just doesn't work that way. If the results do not come right away, reexamine whether you are doing all the things that you need to do. Be patient. The Lord's experimental method works. He wants to give you an answer if you continue to fight your way through the experiment. Once again, don't giveup.<br><br>Let me add that to receive a true and deep testimony of the gospel, you must live in a way that you can receive a witness from the Holy Ghost. President Eyring said the following about the effects of unworthiness on your testimony:<br><br><i>One of the effects of disobeying God seems to be the creation of just enough spiritual anesthetic to block any sensation as the ties to God are being cut. Not only </i>[does]<i> the testimony of the truth slowly erode, but even the memories of what it was like to be in the light </i>[begin]<i> to seem ... like a delusion.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_life-founded-light-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>If there are things in your life that prevent the Holy Ghost from being able to provide this witness, please fix them as part of your testimony experiment. Then the witness will come.<br><h2><b>Share It</b></h2><br>The last key is to share your testimony--whatever stage it is in.<br><br>My wife and I recently went to Singapore with a group of BYU engineering students. What a great experience! While we were there, I had two nice experiences as a result of people sharing their testimonies. One of the highlights of the trip was attending church with the Clementi Ward. The members of the wardwere so welcoming to us. Whatimpressedme mostwas how they focusedonsharingtheir ­testimonies.The youthspeakerssharedtheir ­testimonies. Theadultspeakerssharedtheir testimonies. The bishopric and instructors shared their ­testimonies. It was refreshing to feel such a focus on testimonies. It strengthened my testimony, and I am sure it strengthened theirs as they shared them.<br><br>While in Singapore we also learned something interesting about Emily, our oldest daughter: she's really great at writing letters. Every night we would look forward to reading her lengthy emails, which were informative, detailed, clever, and sometimes silly. She would tell us about what was going on at home and then tell us about each of her classes at school. On a number of occasions she wrote about what she was learning in seminary. She was studying the Martyrdom of the prophet Joseph Smith. In one of her letters Emily shared with us her feelings about the Prophet and about the ultimate price that he and Hyrum paid for the restored gospel. I can't tell you how good that made me feel. Although she might not have known it, she was sharing her testimony. It strengthened my testimony, and I know it strengthened hers. I need to be more like that. Ineed to find simple ways to share my testimony of the gospel. Maybe it will benefit ­others, and it will certainly benefit me.<br><h2><b>My Testimony of Testimonies</b></h2><br>Let me close with another beautiful statement by Elder Holland:<br><br><i>I know this work is God's very truth, and I know that only at our peril would we allow doubt or devils to sway us from its path. Hope on. Journey on. Honestly acknowledge your questions and your concerns, but first and forever fan the flame of your faith.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I want to share my ­testimony of testimonies. I know that no ­matter where your testimony stands, our Father in Heaven wants to help you make it stronger. I know that whether you never had a burning testimony or have temporarily lost it, He can help you find it. Whatever the source of your doubts or concerns, He can remove them. If you fight for your testimony and look to the only source of all truth, I know that you can have your own witness of the truthfulness of the gospel. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mark B.

<h1>r Bow Breaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the summer of 2001 I was serving as a counselor in the stake Young Women presidency in Stillwater, Oklahoma. For various reasons the stake presidency had come to us and asked us to plan for the next year's girls' camp at a state park within our stake boundaries. The park we ended up selecting had fewer affordable recreational opportunities than our previous location.<br><br>We considered a variety of new activities, each with their pluses and minuses. As a Girl Scout leader in Stillwater, I had learned that the local Girl Scout Council provided a two-day course through the National Archery Development Association that gave participants the training to be able to teach basic principles of archery and run a safe archery range. Obtaining the certification would give us access to a substantial discount in purchasing simple recurve bows and arrows. Through personal contacts at the local university I had determined that we could borrow Ethafoam targets and other basic equipment we would need to create a fun and safe experience for our Young Women. The girls loved this new activity. Even after I was released from the presidency, I received an annual invitation to attend girls' camp to run the archery program.<br><br>The so-called "fee" for attending the archery training was that I had my name added to a list of adults certified as level-one archery instructors who were willing to be called upon to run the archery range at various Girl Scout camp locations throughout the council. When it came time to renew my certification, I was asked to consider going through the level-two training, which meant that I would be able to teach the two-day, level-one course that I had previously taken. The level-two training was much more in-depth, focusing in greater detail on various equipment options, physical properties of various types of bows and arrows, refinement of shooting technique, and even how to use a bow string jig, a device that allows you to make a custom bow string.<br><br>At about the time I finished the level-two training and passed the written exam, I started rereading the Book of Mormon. With all of my newly acquired archery knowledge, when I came to the account of Nephi's bow breaking in 1 Nephi 16, I realized for the first time what a truly remarkable story this is. Like much of the Book of Mormon narrative, it is full of understatement. Because none of us here--well, probably none of us--is hunting with a bow as the sole means of providing dietary protein for ourselves or our families and because none of us is currently living in the extreme environment of the Arabian Peninsula, we take the brief details of the story at their simple face value. But doing so means we are not fully appreciating a number of important teachings found in these verses.<br><br>While the book of 1 Nephi is probably the most read, or at least the most often read, book in the Book of Mormon, I want to recall for you the details of this particular story. Nephi had just declared "hard things"<sup>1</sup> to his brothers, which included the truth that no "unclean thing [can] enter into the kingdom of God."<sup>2</sup> This happened while Lehi and his family had been dwelling in the valley of Lemuel, and Nephi's words caused his brothers to "humble themselves before the Lord."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Following this occurrence, Lehi found the Liahona outside the door of his tent. With direction from the Liahona, the family took their tents and departed "into the wilderness," traveling in "nearly a south-southeast direction" and pitching their tents first in a place they called Shazer,<sup>4</sup> which has the meaning of a place with trees,<sup>5</sup> and then on to other "fertile parts of the wilderness."<sup>6</sup> Nephi and his brothers began to hunt with their bows and arrows and stones and slings and were successful in obtaining the wild game the large family needed to survive.<sup>7</sup> Given the various hardships they had endured during their years in the wilderness, this must have seemed like an especially sweet time. There was plenty of food and, however briefly, Laman and Lemuel were not murmuring.<br><br>The point of this story is not to think that hard times are just around the bend when you are experiencing a time of plentitude and blessings. But it is interesting that we ­frequently find that pattern in the scriptures and in our lives. In an October 1995 general conference address, Elder Richard G. Scott taught:<br><br><i>Just when all seems to be going right, challenges often come in multiple doses applied simultaneously. When those trials are not consequences of your disobedience, they are evidence that the Lord feels you are prepared to grow more. ... He therefore gives you experiences that stimulate growth, understanding, and compassion which polish you for your everlasting benefit. To get you from where you are to where He wants you to be requires a lot of stretching, and that generally entails discomfort andpain.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>So, in continuing our story with Nephi, tragedy--and I don't use this word lightly or facetiously--struck, and Nephi's steel bow broke. Whether it was from years of use (a typical modern bow can be shot as many as 100,000 times without losing power when the bow is drawn back) or from corrosion from the high temperature and high humidity in the area or from some other cause, the result was the same. Nephi had lost the means whereby he could provide for his family.<br><br>Not only must his heart have been heavy because he and his family were tired and hungry, but Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael began "to murmur exceedingly"<sup>9</sup> against the conditions they found themselves in, against the Lord, and, it seems, especially against Nephi. The fact that their own bows had "lost their springs"<sup>10</sup> (from being overshot or from the sheer laziness of not unstringing them at the end of the day and releasing the tension on the bow<sup>11</sup>) and the fact that they had done nothing to replace these crucial tools seemed lost on them. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, commenting on this story, "One can almost hear them saying, 'Let Nephi do it. This trip was his idea.'"<sup>12</sup> We are told that even Father Lehi, who was now old and weary, started to murmur against the Lord.<sup>13</sup> Truly Nephi, a faithful and devoted servant of the Lord, was in a dire predicament. Or, as Elder Scott has described, the Lord felt Nephi was prepared to grow more.<br><br>At this point in the story Nephi did something that was really remarkable. He recorded:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said untomy father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Not only did Nephi <i>not</i> give in to the all-too-human pattern of complaining and feeling sorry for himself, but he also did a number of remarkable--even miraculous--things. First, he located the only kind of wood in that desert region that would have been suitable for making a bow.<sup>15</sup> Second, with no previous skill as a bow maker, he crafted a bow that was strong and balanced enough that he could shoot moving game with some degree of accuracy. Third, he fashioned a bowstring that was compatible with the strength of the wooden bow. And fourth, he made one arrow that was straight enough that it could be shot accurately and was sharp enough that it would kill game. As a further aside, somehow Nephi would have had to know that he now needed a longer arrow than the one he had used for his old steel bow with its tighter draw.<sup>16</sup> As Hugh Nibley observed, "Though it sounds simple enough when we read about it, it was almost as great a feat for Nephi to make a bow as it was for him to build a ship."<sup>17</sup><br><br>Like Nephi, each one of us is likely to experience the breaking of a bow--a major life challenge that has all the makings of a personal or family disaster or one that has all the makings of an opportunity to grow. In April 2009 general conference, President Henry B. Eyring said, "With all the differences in our lives, we have at least one challenge in common. We all must deal with adversity."<sup>18</sup> So what then does this extraordinary story from the Book of Mormon teach us about dealing with the trials and adversity that are part of this mortal experience? I think there are at least six principles we can learn from this story.<br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>Given what we already know about Nephi from the first fifteen chapters of 1 Nephi, even though we are not told explicitly that Nephi prayed, it seems inconceivable that in this very challenging situation Nephi would not have turned to Father in Heaven in prayer. Prior to this occurrence prayer is mentioned in connection with a number of major events: First, Nephi knew about the vision of the destruction of Jerusalem that Lehi had received, a revelation that came as a result of Lehi's prayer; second, in response to prayer Nephi's bands were loosed after his brothers bound him during the journey back into the wilderness with Ishmael and his family; and third, Nephi understood that the vision of the tree of life his father had received could only be understood by inquiring of the Lord--that is, by praying.<br><br>When prayer is a consistent part of our daily lives and we have learned to listen for answers to our prayers, we develop confidence in that process. With the still limited preparation Nephi had at that point, perhaps it would have been too much for him to undertake a project as big as building a boat for his family in which to sail to the New World without having had additional experiences to strengthen his testimony of the power of prayer. Certainly it was not just a good guess on Nephi's part that allowed him to make a bow of hunting caliber but rather divine inspiration that came out of a very regular pattern of calling upon Heavenly Father in prayer.<br><br>My guess is that in praying, Nephi did not ask that a new bow, fully formed and ready to solve his problem, be dropped into his lap. If that had been his strategy, it would have been much easier to have just asked to have fresh game delivered to the door of his family's tent. We know from Nephi's account in chapter 11 that he was allowed to see the same vision of the tree of life given to Lehi after "pondering [Lehi's words] in [his] heart."<sup>19</sup> One way of looking at pondering is as intensive preparation required for meaningful prayer. It seems likely that following some pondering, Nephi's words were not the sometimes rote words we use, "Bless me to ..." as in "Bless me to make abow," but instead the more thoughtful question "What can I do to ...?" as in "What can I do to make a bow that will allow me to hunt the game my family needs to survive?"<br><h2><b>Do</b></h2><br>Once Nephi had communed with Father in Heaven in a humble, pleading prayer and had spent time listening to His answer, Nephi had to get up off his knees and act. His family was hungry and temporarily at rest in an area with few alternative food choices to the game he must catch. There was not time for the self-indulgent luxury of self-pity or inaction. He found <i>nab</i> wood, the only wood in the area of the Arabian Peninsula thought suitable for making a bow,<sup>20</sup> and fashioned a bow out of it. Through inspiration or through actually trying to use the arrows from his steel bow, he realized that he needed a longer wooden arrow. Then somehow he was inspired to make a straight, wooden arrow with a head of sufficient lethalness so he could return to feeding his family. His willingness to go and do, as he had previously demonstrated in obtaining the brass plates from Laban, was again manifest in the effort he must have put forth to craft a newbow.<br><br>In my own family I have an example of someone who repeatedly went and did even when wallowing in self-pity might have seemed the more natural course. I am so grateful for her example. My great-grandmother Flora Mae Walker was born in Hillsboro, Texas, on August 14, 1899. Although I spent afair amount of time around her while I was growing up and she died shortly after my twenty-seventh birthday, I knew surprisingly little about her life while she was living. When I was a child, she was the grandmother who was never too busy to read to me; who invited me to spend the weekend with her at her third floor, walk-up apartment in Baltimore; and who had me work jigsaw puzzles with her. In her later years I would visit her in the nursing home when I returned to Maryland occasionally, but by that point she had severe dementia and the visits were for me--not her. There was nothing in my youthful interactions with her that would have led me to believe she had had a life filled with adversity.<br><br>She was the third child of Leonard Newman Walker and Mary V. Rinehart. When she was born, her father was in jail, having been charged with committing arson. Although I had always been told that her mother had died in childbirth, a cousin and I are now pretty certain from research that we have done that her mother abandoned her, leaving her in the care of the doctor who delivered her and his wife. Flora Mae was fortunate in that her father's sisters later took her into their homes, but she moved around with a great deal of frequency--sometimes living with her exonerated father and sometimes not. When she was seventeen she met and married Dr. Playford Rush, a young widowed physician who had come to Texas on assignment with the U.S. Public Health Service. Although doctors did not enjoy the level of income then that they do today, I am sure she thought this marriage was securing her future.<br><br>About a year later Playford was sent to Camp Merritt, New Jersey, where he was assigned to run a hospital for soldiers with Spanish influenza and other ailments and to provide for their needs before they were shipped off to Europe to fight in the Great War--World War I. Flora Mae was pregnant with twin daughters when she and Playford contracted the Spanish flu in October 1918. While an estimated 20 to 50 million people worldwide died in this pandemic, Playford was one of only three Public Health Service physicians who succumbed. Flora Mae survived, but she was a nineteen-year-old widow living 1,200 miles from her family and ready to give birth to twin daughters. From Public Health Service documents at the National Archives, I learned that she had to file a petition to receive any type of survivor benefits and was asked to prove that her deceased husband had contracted the Spanish flu as a result of caring for sickened soldiers. Only a few days before she gave birth to the twins, the panel that reviewed her petition granted her Playford's death benefit.<br><br>For the next few years she lived with family in the Houston area and with Playford's family in western Maryland. Then more tragedy befell her. Flossie, one of the twins, died from diphtheria when she was eighteen months old. The other twin, my grandmother Marjorie Rush, survived. Flora Mae remarried in 1923 and had two more children. On Christmas Eve 1935, when the two younger children had the measles, her second husband went out to get medicine and never returned. Surely her bow had broken--at least for the third time--and yet she went and did, perhaps because she was left with few other choices.<br><br>At various points, due to economic necessity, my Grandmother Marjorie lived away from Flora Mae with other family members. Later, during World War II, Flora Mae secured a night job working in Towson, Maryland, at the Bendix Radio Factory, where they made military aviation equipment. Almost unbelievably, to save the streetcar fare of a dime each way from her Baltimore apartment, she walked the sixteen-mile round trip. I have not yet mentioned that she was born with a type of congenital hip dysplasia and that she walked with a limp her entire life, making this five-days-a-week trip on foot in the humid heat of summer and damp cold of winter on the Mid-Atlantic Seaboard a special challenge.<br><br>The only way for Flora Mae to get a new bow was to do the hard work of making one--just as Nephi had done. Dennis L. Largey, in a 1991 Sperry Symposium address, observed:<br><br><i>Instead of murmuring, Nephi simply went to work and made another bow. Murmuring wastes time, lengthens one's journey, and hardens one's heart. ... God may not always stop bows from breaking, but he does help in the construction of new ones.</i><sup>21</sup><br><h2><b>Turn to Priesthood Leaders</b></h2><br>If I had been Nephi and had been able to successfully fashion a new bow and arrow, I think my thought would have been, "If I was smart enough to do this, I can certainly figure out where the game is that I should hunt." And yet Nephi, ever humble, did not do that. He returned to his father, his priesthood leader, and sought his guidance in the matter. Note the interesting pattern that first he prayed; second, he acted on the revelation that he received; and third, he turned to his priesthood leader for further counsel. One of the great challenges that each of us faces in this life is to develop spiritual self-reliance. Ihave found, as Nephi's story suggests, that we are most prepared to receive counsel from priesthood leaders when we have first communed with Heavenly Father and acted on the­inspiration we have obtained.<br><h2><b>Read the Scriptures</b></h2><br>After Nephi made a new bow and a single arrow, he returned to his father's tent and asked him to inquire of the Lord where he should go to hunt. In answer to this prayer, the Lord told Lehi to "look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written."<sup>22</sup> In our day, that ball, the Liahona, has been likened to the scriptures. Although our natures may be to lean to our own understanding<sup>23</sup> and we want to be dismissive of divine writ when we are facing great challenges, it is frequently then that scripture does hold the answer to dealing with adversity.<br><br>On July 7, 2011, four years ago today, I was diagnosed with stage-two invasive ductile carcinoma, a common form of breast cancer. Even though my mother's mother had died from this same type of cancer and my mother had had the same diagnosis as mine two years previously, I was in shock. I had thought this might be something that I would deal with in my late sixties as they had, but I wasn't even fifty. In the space of one phone call I went from someone who I would have considered to be very healthy to someone who was facing a major health challenge. My bow had broken.<br><br>One of the key impressions that I had during the time immediately following this diagnosis and while I was trying to determine what my options were was that I should redouble my scripture study. My initial reaction to this strong prompting was, "I am not going to find the cure for cancer or the name of the surgeon I should go to by reading the scriptures!" Yet as I acted on this feeling and read, I received very clear impressions about what I should do and who would be the best to help me in my particular situation. I was focused on the needs of my body, but I learned that the needs of my spirit were every bit as great, if not greater.<br><br>After extensive surgery, it was determined that due to my family history an aggressive treatment plan was needed and the best course of action would be a number of rounds of chemotherapy followed by more surgery. About ten days after my first treatment, my hair started to fall out by the handful, my bones ached with a flu-like intensity, and I started to experience the neuropathy--the numbness in my fingers and toes--that would last far beyond the chemotherapy treatments. Although I had tried to mentally prepare myself against it, a certain amount of self-pity set in. At about this same time came October 2011 general conference. As I tuned in to the first session, I remember praying that there would be something said that would help me in my current situation. In that Saturday morning session, the very first talk that was given was by Elder Scott on "The Power of Scripture." In this wonderful address that seemed to be given just for my personal ­benefit, he stated the following:<br><br><i>Scriptures can calm an agitated soul, giving peace, hope, and a restoration of confidence in one's ability to overcome the challenges of life. They have potent power to heal emotional challenges when there is faith in the Savior. They can accelerate physical healing.</i><br><br><i>Scriptures can communicate different meanings at different times in our life, according to our needs. A scripture that we may have read many times can take on nuances of meaning that are refreshing and insightful when we face a new challenge in life.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Again my attention was turned to the scriptures, but this time as a source of accelerated physical healing--as a way of making a new bow.<br><h2><b>Feel Gratitude in Your Circumstances</b></h2><br>Thinking about what we know from Nephi,it is difficult to imagine him whining orcomplaining as he petitioned Heavenly Father for His help. It is harder still to ­imagine that he would not have offered a prayer of thanksgiving when he was again able to feed his family.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell eloquently stated:<br><br><i>Broken bows litter the landscapes of our lives, representing yesterday's frustrations. These were real enough at the moment. Dotting the same landscape, however, are many more reminders of blessings than of discarded broken bows. May we have the eyes to see that which an outside auditor would surely see as he counts our blessings.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>We too can choose to be grateful regardless of our circumstances--even when our bows have broken. We can receive the calm assurance that our Father in Heaven loves us and isgiving us an opportunity to grow. In the April 2014 general conference President DieterF. Uchtdorf counseled:<br><br><i>We can choose to be grateful, no matter what.</i><br><br><i>This type of gratitude transcends whatever is happening around us. It surpasses disappointment, discouragement, and despair. It blooms just as ­beautifully in the icy landscape of winter as it does in the pleasant warmth of summer. ...</i><br><br><i>Being grateful in times of distress does </i><b><i>not</i></b><i> mean that we are pleased with our circumstances. It </i><b><i>does</i></b><i> mean that through the eyes of faith we look beyond our present-day challenges.</i><br><br><i>This is not a gratitude of the lips but of the soul. It is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind. ...</i><br><br><i>True gratitude is an expression of hope </i><b><i>and</i></b><i> testimony. It comes from acknowledging that we do not always understand the trials of life but trusting that one day we will.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>Thinking back to my own health challenge, it would be difficult to honestly feel gratitude <i>for</i> it. Yet I remember feeling a tremendous amount of gratitude in knowing that Heavenly Father was personally mindful of my situation, as shown by a nearly continuous stream of tender mercies that happened throughout that ordeal--of supportive phone calls from out-of-town friends that I hadn't heard from in years, of meals that just showed up at my house, and of thoughtful acts of service rendered by family, ward members, neighbors, and coworkers.<br><h2><b>Expect Miracles</b></h2><br>When Nephi's bow broke, his life and the lives of his family hung in the balance. What he needed was a miracle in order to find a solution. On lds.org a miracle is defined as "an extraordinary event caused by the power of God."<sup>27</sup> It is interesting that Nephi, Laman, and Lemuel saw many of the same extra­ordinary events caused by the power of God but that only Nephi recognized them for the miracles they were.<br><br>From June 2013 through December 2014 I had the privilege of receiving weekly missionary emails written by Emily Lewis, a BYU student who served in the Australia Adelaide Mission. Sister Lewis frequently concluded her emails with the advice to "remember to look for the miracles every day." Initially I was a ­little put off by this. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that in looking for miracles we demonstrate to Heavenly Father that we are open to and have faith in His power to cause extraordinary events in our own lives and in the lives of ­others. Nephi had the kind of faith required for a miracle--tobuild a working bow from the very limited materials at hand and to successfully hunt the game his family needed for their very survival.<br><br>We can trust in Heavenly Father that the growth we experience at the points at which our bows break will bring the miracle of blessings previously unimagined. Sometimes the evidence of such miracles may take time to recognize. In thinking back to my great-­grandmother Flora Mae Walker, I am sure that she had days and nights of despair, but I consider her posterity: daughters who had happy and long marriages of more than sixty years, grand­children and great-grandchildren who have made loving homes and had professional success, and even a few great-great-­grandchildren who are pursuing excellent educational opportunities such as those found at Brigham Young University. I think surely this is a miracle sprung out of adversity.<br><br>I think back to the health news I received four years ago today. Never could I have imagined in that moment or even in the year that followed that I would be standing here today having this opportunity to be the campus devotional speaker or serving as the university librarian at BYU. How could Ifail to see these things as miracles?<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>President Thomas S. Monson wisely observed, "Our most significant opportunities will be found in times of greatest difficulty."<sup>28</sup> As we pray, act upon the revelation we receive, counsel with our priesthood leaders, faithfully study the scriptures, feel gratitude in our circumstances, and expect miracles, we, like Nephi of old, will be able to make a new bow when ours inevitably breaks. In the language of the Doctrine and Covenants, we will be able to "come off conqueror."<sup>29</sup> I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jennifer Paustenbaugh was the university librarian at BYU when this devotional address was given on 7 July 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. 1 Nephi 16:1.<br><br>2. 1 Nephi 15:34.<br><br>3. 1 Nephi 16:5.<br><br>4. 1 Nephi 16:12–13.<br><br>5.

Today is July 14. For most it is just another hot summer day, but for those with French connections it is La Fête Nationale, the day that France celebrates its independence. Every July 14 I am reminded of my missionary service in France and Belgium years ago. One July 14 my missionary companions and I watched from the port of Calais as fireworks burst over the English Channel in beautiful celebration of French freedom. This was a wonderful time for me--the last summer months of my mission among a people I had come to love and with whom I had labored to build faith and trust in God. Their faith had been terribly challenged by the ravages of war and other events, but some received the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and have been greatly blessed by its teachings.<br><br>Faith in God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ is a powerful force that moves souls and nations to look to the heavens for understanding of the purpose of life on earth. For me, some of the most inspiring verses of scripture are those that enumerate the exploits of the faithful, as in Hebrews 11 of the New Testament and Ether 12 of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>In Ether, Moroni told us that<br><br><i>faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>He then reminded us of the immovable faith of Alma and Amulek, Ammon and his brethren, Helaman's sons Nephi and Lehi, and the brother of Jared.<br><br>In Hebrews 11, the apostle Paul wrote of the faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Sara. Of Abraham and Sara, Paul stated:<br><br><i> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Paul continued:<br><br><i>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</i><br><br><i>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Then, referring to all these noble souls, Paul made a statement that captures our attention:<br><br><i>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>What was Paul teaching us in this passage? Was he saying that these great ones understood that this earth was not their home but rather a stopover on their way through the eternities?<br><br>This is one of the compelling questions of mankind. Are we truly strangers and pilgrims on the earth and is there more to our ­existence than meets the eye? Here we live on this small but beautiful blue planet. We each make our way through life doing what we want or what others convince us to do, but what is the­purpose of it all?<br><br>My background is in the sciences, and scientists seek to understand the great questions of life by making observations. One of the most inspiring scientific endeavors of our time has been the exploration of our universe through the Hubble Space Telescope. Although I have no expertise in astrophysics, the subject fascinates me, probably as a result of watching too many episodes of <i>Star Trek</i> as a boy.<br><br>This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Hubble's launch. During those twenty-five years, a nearly constant stream of data has been coming from Hubble that has taught us much. One experiment, called the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field,<sup>5</sup> focused the telescope on a small region of the sky apparently devoid of stars and collected light at different times over a ten-year period, logging more than 500 hours. To get an idea of the size of this small area, it is roughly equivalent to what you would see if you looked into the sky through an eight-foot-long soda straw.<sup>6</sup> The Hubble images showed that this region was not devoid of stars at all but contained 5,500 galaxies, averaging about 100 billion stars each.<sup>7</sup> The light from the most distant galaxies had been traveling for about 13.2 billion years before being collected by Hubble.<sup>8</sup><br><br>From these data, astronomers have estimated that there are 200 billion galaxies in the universe with an average of 100 billion stars per galaxy. Doing the math gives two-times-10<sup>22</sup> stars in the universe--an absolutely mind-boggling number.<sup>9</sup> By measuring the distance to these galaxies and how quickly they are moving away from us and by combining this data with other observations of the early universe, astrophysicists have calculated that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old and is growing in size at a faster and faster rate.<sup>10</sup> For this accelerated expansion to be possible, about 70 percent of the universe must be something astronomers term "dark energy"<sup>11</sup> because we don't know what it is. For me, the grandeur of it all is eloquently captured by the words and music of our opening hymn, "If You Could Hie to Kolob."<sup>12</sup> When William W. Phelps penned the words of the hymn, he did not have the vision of the Hubble telescope, but he had the vision of Joseph Smith, and Joseph had the vision of God.<br><br>So how and why did all of this come to be and where do we fit in this great expanse of space? Science struggles to address these questions. However, there are other very important ways to learn truth. The apostle Paul taught in writing to the Corinthians, "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."<sup>13</sup> Paul continued, "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."<sup>14</sup> Thus God can reveal His existence, purposes, and truths to us by spiritual means that are just as real as physical scientific ­observations. This is what happened to Moses on the mountain.<br><br>Millennia before the Hubble telescope, Godspoke with Moses face-to-face and gave him a view of His creations. This experience is recorded in Moses 1 of the Pearl of Great Price:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; ofthe same he greatly marveled and wondered.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>In response to this experience, Moses exclaimed:<br><br><i>Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>Perhaps we also feel a sense of insignificance when attempting to fathom the vastness of creation. However, later in this revelation God taught Moses the purpose of His creations:<br><br><i>And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: Theheavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.</i><br><br><i>And as one earth shall pass away, and the ­heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.</i><br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--tobring to pass the immortality and eternal life ofman.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>In this transcendent passage God revealed that the purpose of this vast creation is for us, for our happiness, and for our eternal progression.<br><br>So where were we during this ­marvelous creation? The Lord asked Job this same question:<br><br><i>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? ...</i><br><br><i>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>One of the most essential truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that we are spirit children of the great Creator Himself, and we call Him Father because that is our true relationship to Him.<sup>19</sup> Knowing this relationship explains why He created all these things for us. Prior to our life here on earth we lived with Him,<sup>20</sup> and we were present and witnessed our earth's creation and shouted for joy because of it! This is why we truly are ­strangers and pilgrims on the earth.<br><br>For me, one of the most beautiful expressions of this truth was penned by the poet William Wordsworth. He came to an understanding of this truth without hearing the ­message of the restored gospel. He wrote:<br><br><i>Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:</i><br><i>The soul that rises with us, our life's star,</i><br><i>Hath had elsewhere its setting,</i><br><i>And cometh from afar:</i><br><br><i>Not in entire forgetfulness,</i><br><i>And not in utter nakedness,</i><br><i>But trailing clouds of glory do we come</i><br><i>From God, who is our home.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>So if we have come from God, then why arewe here? On occasion it seems like it might have been better to just stay put. Livingwith our Father in Heaven must have been wonderful, so why go to the trouble? This thought reminds me of something my father-in-law, Jean Marichal, would often quip in his native French language, exclaiming, "<i>Qui m'a poussé dedans?"</i> which, translated, means, "Who pushed me in?" He would say this mostly, but not entirely, in jest. The answer to why we are here was revealed clearly to Abraham, as recorded in the Pearl of Great Price:<br><br><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</i><br><br><i>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</i><br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Herein lies the answer to the great question of the purpose of life. We are here to learn to trust in God to the point that we do whatever He asks, and in so doing we become as He is.<br><br>It seems to me that the most important thing we can do in life is to find out if this really is true: that God is our Father, that we are strangers and pilgrims on the earth, and that we are here to become like our Father. So how do we come to this knowledge? The process begins by hearing of these things from those who know.<sup>23</sup> That is why we send missionaries throughout the world. My youngest daughter, Eva, is currently one of those missionaries, serving on Réunion and Mauritius, which are islands in the Indian Ocean--about as far away from here as is physically possible on earth. Many of you were in similar situations as missionaries, and perhaps some of you are here today because your hearts burned as the missionaries taught you of your divine origins and the purpose of life.<br><br>Hearing and pondering these things will lead us to pray, and through prayer our Father can tell us Himself that He is there and we are His children. Let me share an experience withyou.<br><br>While serving as a missionary in France, not long after the July 14 celebration I referred to earlier, my companion and I had spent the day working with the other missionaries in the city of Nancy. We were scheduled to travel that night to Strasbourg, about a two-hour drive away on the German border. I had returned in the evening with the missionary I was with and was waiting in the apartment for my ­companion to return.<br><br>My companion and the other missionary finally arrived a little after 10 p.m., apologizing for the late hour and explaining that they had been in a spirited discussion with an atheist who was trying to convince them of the error of their ways. We quickly packed our things and got on the road. While driving, my companion talked about the conversation with theatheist.<br><br>The arguments were all too familiar to me. God may exist, but there is no way to know for sure. And if He does exist, then He doesn't care about us or He would have stopped the terrible events in the world. Furthermore, our belief in God was a deception that made us feel better about our lives, but the reality was that when we died, there was nothing.<br><br>We talked about these issues and about how difficult it is for such a person to even want to know the reality of God. For some reason my companion's encounter left me perturbed, not because I was shaken by the arguments--for I had heard them many times--but because I was wearied by the unbelief of these people among whom I had spent so much time and whom Ihad come to care about.<br><br>I remember looking up into the night sky as we drove on and seeing it filled with stars. We almost never saw the stars because they were obscured by the city lights or by clouds. However, we were now far from the city, ­traveling through the Vosges Mountains, and the skies were clear. As I gazed upon the night sky, I had this overwhelming impression that God was in His heaven and was in control. I commented on this to my companion, wondering how anyone could look up into the night sky and not feel the same thing.<br><br>I was in this same state of mind when we arrived in Strasbourg around midnight. We apologized to our missionary hosts for the late arrival and laid out our bedding, which consisted of a foam pad and a sleeping bag for each of us on the floor. I knelt on mine to pray, as was my nightly routine. However, this prayer turned out to be anything but routine. As I prayed, I thought of the events and emotions of that night, and I pleaded, "Dear Father, I need to know if you are really there if I am going to continue in this work among such an unbelieving people."<br><br>As soon as that phrase formed in my mind, I was enveloped by an intense spiritual energy that pulsed through my body from my head to my toes and settled upon me. It was a warm, comforting feeling that stayed with me for a long time. It was the witness of the Holy Spirit to me that God was there and that He had heard my prayer. I finished praying and lay down to sleep, but the feeling would not go away. I lay basking in this powerful yet sweet sensation for some time until it slowly ­dissipated and I drifted off to sleep.<br><br>Since then I have never doubted the existence of God. I know He answered me. More than thirty years later that experience is still vivid in my mind. I do not know how the Spirit of God interfaces with our mortal physiology, but it is powerful and unlike any other ­emotion. It cannot be explained away.<br><br>So once we have come to know our ­relationship with our Father in Heaven and our purpose in life, then our path is set before us. However, part of the "prove them herewith" clause of the plan is to stay on the path and never forget the knowledge we have gained. Remembering our origins and purposes is key to our success here on earth. Remembering is one of the important themes in the Book of Mormon. Listen to the words of Helaman to his sons Nephi and Lehi:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Furthermore, it is for this same purpose that each week we take the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus's sacrifice and promise to "always remember him and keep his commandments."<sup>25</sup> Yet sometimes we forget, our vision blurs, and we do not live up to the knowledge we have received.<br><br>In such situations, perhaps we can learn something more from the Hubble telescope--not from its amazing images but from its near failure. To the horror of all those involved, when the first images came back from Hubble, they were blurred and out of focus. The shape of Hubble's mirrors were off about one-fiftieth the thickness of a human hair because of a few missing chips of paint that had thrown off the laser-guided measuring tool used to polish the mirrors.<sup>26</sup> Many thought that the Hubble telescope would be forever useless.<br><br>However, with a herculean effort by NASA scientists and astronauts, correction mirrors were designed and installed in space, removing the aberration. Making the repairs in space was so intricate that the team of astronauts spent twenty months practicing the procedure, with 400 hours underwater to simulate zero gravity, rehearsing on a mock-up of Hubble.<sup>27</sup> The repairs proceeded flawlessly, and NASA scientists celebrated in joy and relief when they saw the first crystal-clear images coming from the telescope.<sup>28</sup><br><br>There is a great lesson to be learned from correcting Hubble's vision. Sometimes small flaws can put our lives out of focus and we cannot see our divine origins. In such circumstances, our lives need not be scrapped like a piece of interstellar junk, but correcting mirrors can be installed--thanks to something more than a herculean effort that we call the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Jesus was the one who came forward in that Grand Council in Heaven, presenting Himself with the words "Here am I, send me."<sup>29</sup> He was the one who was faithful when facing unimaginable suffering, saying, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."<sup>30</sup> We can trust in Him and in His power to make things right again, and our lives can someday reflect views even more glorious than those from the repaired Hubble telescope.<br><br>At some point sooner or later, our time as mortals on this earth will end and we will learn that we were truly strangers and pilgrims here. This fact became devastatingly clear to me eighteen months ago when my younger brother Kendall died suddenly of a heart attack, seemingly in full health and just a few weeks after being released as bishop of his ward. His ward loved him, especially the youth. Professionally, he worked at the hospital in our small town and was similarly loved by the patients and by his coworkers.<br><br>Our family was emotionally shaken to its core by this tragedy, but our faith was not. We knew the promises of the Resurrection and had felt the power of the witness of Mary at the open tomb as she turned in hearing Jesus call her name, of the disciples on the road to Emmaus as their hearts burned within them while they conversed unknowingly with the resurrected Lord, of the apostles gathered together in fear and wonder of the events of that first Easter and then in what must have been utter joy as they felt the prints of the nails in His hands and His feet, and of the Nephite multitude as Jesus ministered unto them in power and glory. Jesus has overcome death, and, as a result, so will we.<br><br>This tragedy gave me great cause for reflection about my life and how I should spend the rest of my days. It also motivated me to have my physical heart carefully examined. One test was a cardiac perfusion test, in which you walk on a treadmill to get your heart rate up and then you receive an injection with a radioactive tracer. You are placed in a scanner that follows the tracer as it circulates through your heart. During the test you must lie very still under the scanner for some time so as not to disturb the imaging.<br><br>As I lay there, I closed my eyes trying to relax, wondering how my heart was performing in this test. Suddenly, without ­opening myeyes, I saw my brother walk past the ­scanner. He was dressed in his hospital scrubs, looking young and healthy. He moved past me to the other room where the monitor was showing the results of the scan. In my amazement, my first thought was, "What are you doing here?" and then the realization hit me that he was concerned about my well-being and wanted to know the results of the test. This view was gone in an instant, and I was left to contemplate it. The act was so ­typical of him, doing what he did in life, ­caring for others.<br><br>From this and many other experiences, I too confess that we are strangers and pilgrims on the earth, that life continues after our mortal bodies fail us, that our loved ones who have gone before know us and are there to help us. Alma declared this truth in saying:<br><br><i>The spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</i><br><br><i>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</i><sup>31</sup><br><br>I testify that this is so. Let me close with the final words of Brother Phelps's hymn:<br><br><i>There is no end to glory;</i><br><i>There is no end to love;</i><br><i>There is no end to being;</i><br><i>There is no death above.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>May we all live and love and serve to the measure of this knowledge. In the name of Him who makes it all possible, even our Savior Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Barry M.

<br>
Today I want to explore the topic of creativity and the spiritual connection it can help us have with our Heavenly Father. While creativity is an attribute we often associate with the arts, it is an important tool for finding our inner artistin every discipline at the university. The scriptures teach us that Heavenly Father is a profoundly creative Being, and He has made us to be that way too. Creativity helps us bring light to the world and our relationships and to find deep and satisfying joy.<br><br>At general conference in 2008 President Dieter F. Uchtdorf encouraged us to be creative:<br><br><i>The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. No matter our talents, education, backgrounds, or abilities, we each have an inherent wish to create something that did not exist before.</i><br><br><i> Everyone can create. You don't need money, position, or influence in order to create something ofsubstance or beauty.</i><br><br><i> Creation brings deep satisfaction and fulfillment. We develop ourselves and others when we take unorganized matter into our hands and mold it into something of beauty.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> You might say, "I'm not the creative type.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>."</i><br><br><i> If that is how you feel, think again, and remember that you are spirit </i>[children]<i> of the most creative Being in the universe. Isn't it remarkable to think that your very spirits are fashioned by an endlessly creative and eternally compassionate God? Think about it--your spirit body is a masterpiece, created with a beauty, function, and capacity beyond imagination.</i><br><br><i> But to what end were we created? We were created with the express purpose and potential of experiencing a fulness of joy. Our birthright--and the purpose of our great voyage on this earth--is to seek and experience eternal happiness. One of the ways we find this is by creating things.</i>...<br><br><i> You may think you don't have talents, but that is a false assumption, for we all have talents and gifts, every one of us. The bounds of creativity extend far beyond the limits of a canvas or a sheet of paper and do not require a brush, a pen, or the keys of a piano. Creation means bringing into existence something that did not exist before</i>.<i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> What you create doesn't have to be perfect. .</i><i>.</i><i>. Don't let fear of failure discourage you. Don't let the voice of critics paralyze you--whether that voice comes from the outside or the inside. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> The more you trust and rely upon the Spirit, the greater your capacity to create. That is your opportunity in this life and your destiny in the life to come. .</i><i>.</i><i>. As you take the normal opportunities of your daily life and create something of beauty and helpfulness, you improve not only the world around you but also the world within you.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Creativity is an essential part of my life--something I study and inspire others to find. It is a trait I hear a large number of people claim they don't have, but in my work I have grown to believe that every human being is capable of cultivating it. I have seen it bloom and develop in countless people who thought they would never find it. I have also needed creativity in parenting and in strengthening family life. Bringing imagination to every experience makes life fun.<br><h2><b>Our Creative Birthright</b></h2><br>What is creativity exactly and how do we find it, especially if we feel we don't have it? I like President Uchtdorf's definition: "Creation means bringing into existence something that did not exist before." I would like to take a broad view of creativity here. What kinds of creativity are you best at? Are you a maker, a thinker, an innovator, or a problem solver? Does your creativity shine most with your hands, your mind, or your heart?<br><br>We learn of Heavenly Father's creativity in Genesis, in the Pearl of Great Price, and at the temple.<br><br>The book of Abraham says:<br><br><i>Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made;</i><br><br><i> And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof</i>.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The second chapter of the book of Moses should sound familiar:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth; write the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.</i><br><br><i> And the earth was without form, and void; and I caused darkness to come up upon the face of the deep; and my Spirit moved upon the face of the water; for I am God.</i><br><br><i> And I, God, said: Let there be light; and there was light.</i><br><br><i> And I, God, saw the light; and that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness.</i><br><br><i> And I, God, called the light Day; and the darkness, I called Night; and this I did by the word of my power, and it was done as I spake; and the evening and the morning were the first day.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>And so the story of the great Creation unfolds. The story I have just read includes the spiritual creation of the earth, sun, and stars as well as the plants, trees, vines, and herbs. God made whales of the deep, fish, and fowl of the air. He made cattle, beasts, and creeping things.<br><br>This great event concludes with the creation of human beings. We read of the physical creation of Adam and Eve in the book of Abraham:<br><br><i>And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness; and we will give them dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</i><br><br><i> So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them.</i><br><br><i> And the Gods said: We will bless them. And the Gods said: We will cause them to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> . . . We will give them life.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>The story of the Creation informs us that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son are deeply creative beings. We are taught in these verses that we are made in the image of our heavenly parents and also in Their likeness. In other words, <i>we are also deeply creative beings</i>. We are meant to create, and this capacity is eternal. We were creative in the premortal existence and are meant to be so here on earth. From everything we learn about the hereafter through the scriptures and the temple, we know we will continue to live intensely ­creative lives.<br><br>Think about what we can take with us to the next life. All we get to bring are our talents, knowledge, experience, relationships, and creativity. Creativity is therefore enormously important to cultivate.<br><br>The plan of salvation teaches us that the premortal existence was a time when we were thinking, creating, and problem solving. We know that we had to make choices; one of the most important was that we chose to follow the Savior in the Council in Heaven.<br><br>What other evidence do we have of our creativity before we came here to earth? If we look closely at the scriptures we find radiant bursts of creativity from angels in important moments through time. A good example of this is the birth of our Savior. Luke tells us: "And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."<sup>5</sup><br><br>I don't think it is far-fetched to assume that this praise was heavenly music. I believe with all my heart that the heavenly host included all those who love the Savior and whose hearts resonate with Him. What I am trying to say is, I think we would have been included. If you could have been there, would you have? Iwouldn't have missed it. The veil is thin for me on that experience. I can almost touch it in my memory every Christmas when we raise our voices in song. Our joy must have been abundant in that moment; the heavens overflowed.<br><br>I have had the blessing of living a creative life at home and in my work. One of my jobs here at BYU is to cultivate creativity in ­others--to find and nurture their inner spark. What does a person need to be creative? Some of the markers I see are curiosity, eagerness to learn, courage to be innovative, willingness to work hard, a desire to be a problem solver, and the ability to learn from mistakes. These are the same tools required to excel in just about any discipline at the university.<br><h2><b>Creative Problem Solving and Collaboration</b></h2><br>Problem solving is a legitimate form of ­creativity and a tremendous skill. Ingenuity has been required of the prophets and their families. Noah, Nephi, the brother of Jared, and their families all had to build boats for epic trips that challenged their survival. They had to build unique vessels, unlike anything they had needed before. It is safe to assume that none of them was a professional boat builder. It is possible they felt inadequate for the job at first. But these families placed their confidence in the Lord and went to work.<br><br>We know that Noah was particularly challenged to make his vessel able to fit all thevaried animals of the earth. I have often wondered about the curious logistics this would require. How did he collect and store food? How did he keep prey safe from predators? How was the vessel compartmentalized to fit everything it needed to? Noah's creativity was constantly informed by his willingness to be reliant on the Lord.<br><br>In Nephi's case, the task would have seemed nearly impossible. When he was asked to build a ship, his first concern was that he didn't have tools or even know of a source for metal ore from which he could form some. But Nephi persevered by seeking inspiration and guidance every step of the way, and he got the task done.<sup>6</sup><br><br>The brother of Jared's story of creating vessels is touching to me because of his great desire to have light in them. He knew this was not only a practical desire for his people but also something that would help them have the psychological stamina to survive the trip. The book of Ether tells the account:<br><br><i>And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?</i><br><br><i> And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire</i>.<sup>7</sup><br><br>The brother of Jared went to work. The next chapter of Ether continues the story:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:</i><br><br><i> O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. .</i><i>.</i><i>. O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.</i><br><br><i> . . . Behold these things which I have molten out of the rock.</i><br><br><i> And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.</i><br><br><i> Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men.</i><br><br><i> And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>This remarkable passage reveals a number of things: The brother of Jared had a direct conversation with God; additionally, there was a creative collaboration on display. The brother of Jared found a solution for his problem and collaborated closely with the Lord to make it work. The Lord helped the brother of Jared because of his tremendous faith. This collaborative problem-solving experience helped the brother of Jared to know the Lord more completely. The verses later in the chapter teach us that the level of faith the brother of Jared demonstrated was so extraordinary that the Lord could not withhold anything from him.<br><br>Interesting patterns I have observed in our time are that modern studies frequently prove principles of the gospel to be true, and this particular topic is no exception. Current studies in popular culture teach us that collaboration is one of the most fruitful ways to inspire creativity. I won't belabor those references right now, but just remember this: we are stronger when we work together. We are even stronger when we invite the Lord to be a part of what we do.<br><h2><b>The Connecting Power of Creativity</b></h2><br>Studying the many cultures of the earth inspires my own creativity. One of the great privileges of my life has been to take my family to New Zealand for six months in 2012. What a great adventure we had! While there I learned about the customs, language, and art of the indigenous people, the Māori. Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand in Wellington had a remarkable exhibition while I was there called <i>Kahu Ora,</i> or <i>Living Cloaks</i>. It focused on <i>te kākahu Māori,</i> which, translated, means "Māori cloaks." It was one of the most beautiful commentaries on creativity I had ever seen. You can still see the supplemental material for the exhibit online, even though it is no longer on display. With a keyword search using the word <i>kākahu,</i> you will be able to find the website dedicated to the exhibition and learn more of what I speak.<sup>9</sup><br><br><i> </i>Making Māori cloaks is a labor-intensive craft. Think of the story of the Little Red Hen, who plants the wheat, grows the wheat, harvests the wheat, grinds the wheat, and then makes bread. The art of making cloaks is a harder job. It takes about two years to make one that is a masterpiece. The work is all done by hand. The weaver needs to grow and prepare the <i>harekeke,</i> or plant, into fine strands. Then the weaver will braid, weave, and twine it into a fabric, usually a large rectangle to drape around the body. The weavers frequently add feathers, such as from the kiwi, to every stitch. This can mean thousands and thousands of feathers. It also means the weavers have to track down the birds to get the feathers! They don't kill the protected birds; they search for the fluff the birds shed in the course of normal life. It is a long and drawn-out venture.<br><br>The cloaks are admired for their design and beauty, and weavers are considered great artists and are highly valued. I was personally most interested in hearing the weavers speak about how they see more than the physical creation of the cloak in their work but a kind of spirituality as well. The weaver primarily sees <i>aho,</i> or connection. She sees how the fibers come from harekeke, a plant from the earth. She sees how she has coaxed the fibers of the plants to connect together to make the cloak with warp and weft. She sees the significant time of her life dedicated and connected to the cloak. She remembers the <i>whakapapa</i> (or genealogy) of generations of weavers who kept the art alive to teach her how to make the cloak. She sees the connection of these weavers to <i>Hine-te-iwa-iwa,</i> the spiritual guardian of weaving, childbirth, and the cycles of the moon. She sees the love of her ancestors paired with her own love, woven into every stitch of the cloak. It is no surprise that Māori weavers believe all of this will connect with the person the cloak was made for and offer protection to the wearer.<br><br>To give you some background about why I am so touched by cloaks, you need to know that I am crazy about handwork. All textiles interest me. I am an avid knitter, embroiderer, and quilter. I love to work with my hands. Iam a maker. It is hard to explain why I am good at it, but it is almost like I have a genetic connection on a cellular level with all of the generations of grandparents who have had these same gifts before me. My fingers just know what to do. I feel <i>aho,</i> or a connection to the Māori way of thinking about creativity. Ifeel warmth, comfort, and connection to my ancestors who had these same talents and to God, who gave them to me. I feel at peace with handwork because I am doing what I was created to do. There are moments it feels sacred.<br><br>It is hard to explain to others how I feel about my creativity, but I found it expressed in a painting. The artist, Brian Kershisnik, calls it <i>She Will Find What Is Lost</i>.<sup>10</sup> For me, this painting is a wonderful expression of how we can receive inspiration. It resonates with how I feel when Iam being creative.<br><h2><b>Discovering and Developing Your OwnCreativity</b></h2><br>Another key to finding creativity is to seek diverse experiences that are enriching and will fill you with light. Doctrine and Covenants<i> </i>88:11 reads: "And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings."<br><br>What practical applications can creativity have for you right now in this moment? What can you do to turn on the switch for creativity? I have a bit of advice.<br><br>Study the creative thinkers, doers, ­makers, innovators, and problem solvers through time. It is impossible to study everyone, but pick a few you are drawn to, such as those in your field of study. Heavenly Father has sent astonishingly gifted spirits to be beacons of light for our world. There are aspects of their work that can always teach us and transform us. Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa, Galileo Galilei, Mary Cassatt, Michelangelo, Anne Frank, Ludwig van Beethoven, Marie Curie, Dmitri Shostakovich, Jane Goodall, Madeleine L'Engle, Copernicus, Florence Nightingale, Gregor Mendel, Jane Austen, and Leonardo daVinci. I could go on and on. If we tried to collectively make a better list than this, which I am sure we could, we would find the list to be almost endless. So much light has been sent to the world for our benefit and learning. The great Creator blesses us in so many ways. He creates magnificent and diverse spirits.<br><br>Find your sphere, your niche, and your ­specialty. "Trailing clouds of glory do we come"<sup>11</sup> is how William Wordsworth described our journey here to earth. We all come with particular gifts. Your time here at the university is a tremendous opportunity to discover, study, and develop those personal gifts. Study at your desk but also seek lively conversations with your peers and professors about the questions you have and the things you want to know. Ask them about the questions that burn inside of them. Have the courage to get to the bottom of the questions in your field. Bore deep to find what still needs to be studied. Have the fire in your belly to see things through, even when you are tired of the experiment. You will excel in your field when you are truly passionate and articulate about it. Be an artist in your discipline.<br><br>Beware of paralysis from criticism. Creativity and learning need freedom. Allow for time to get in the groove and to learn muscle memory. Sometimes it is our inner critic that is the greatest enemy to our own growth. Sticking with the critic doesn't get us past the stop sign. It is difficult to move forward with that negativity. Learn from your mistakes. It is okay to make mistakes. Instead of chastising your mistakes, study them. Be curious. My students will laugh when I tell you this, but I teach them to say often, "Thank you, mistakes." I make them say it out loud and smile when they say it! Turn off the critic and turn on the teacher inside of you. When you study your mistakes with patience and love, you can identify what needs to change and how. Patience will bring the malleability you need so that you can improve and move forward. This will also be the moment when you are magnified.<br><br>Parenting has taught me that mistakes are fine and are part of the process of learning. They help us learn better than any other experience. We would never scold a five-year-old for falling when learning to ride a bike. We cheer for the movement forward. We help the child get up, dust off, and try again--and again. Every person deserves that same ­courtesy, even you.<br><br>Get out of your comfort zone. The university is a rich environment in which to learn about things outside your discipline. In my experience, these are the crucial places that may stimulate your creativity most of all. Be hungry to learn your discipline. And when you are done studying for the day, learn about other things in your free time. Never stop reading, listening, and looking for evidence of divine light. To enrich your experiences, connect and collaborate with others who have different talents. This light will help you see your discipline with new eyes.<br><br>Here are some scenarios to get you started: If you are a painter, Provo is the perfect place to take up hiking, and don't forget to take a friend passionate about geology or botany with you so that you can learn more about the stunning landscape as you cover it. If you are a chemist, make friends with the people in your ward who love to cook to deepen your understanding of how and why things work in your kitchen. Your knowledge and a dose of chemistry can help them too. Cook together and share your creations with someone who is in need of good cheer. If you are an engineer, make sure you visit the BYU Museum of Art regularly and, for fun conversation, take a date who has artistic sensibility. Engineering and art are a perfect pairing, as demonstrated in the recent MOA exhibit <i>Folding Paper: The Infinite Possibilities of Origami.</i><br><br>If the only symphony you have ever listened to in your life is one you heard when an orchestra visited your grade school, then you really need to expand your horizons. Take the time this Sunday to listen to something you are pretty sure is a masterpiece, such as Beethoven's Symphony no. 9. The music and dance library in the HaroldB. Lee Library will have one for you to check out. Avoid earbuds and find a good stereo and a private place, and turn the stereo up a little louder than you think you should. Lie down on the floor so that you are not only listening with your ears but so that you can also feel the floorboards shake. That is what it feels like to be in the middle of the viola section. Not only will it resonate strongly in your heart that way but it will have the potential to be a spiritual experience. Become a concertgoer if that experience inspires you. If you don't like it, it doesn't mean it is bad music; it means you don't understand it yet. Campus has hundreds of concert opportunities for you to choose from. Seek to understand.<br><br>For musicians, I have a different assignment. Get to the physics lab and learn about the amazing sound room. If you are studying nursing, try going to the theater to study matters of the heart and to fill your mind with beautiful words, ideas, and conversations. It will help you interact with your patients. If you are studying law, have a party on Martin Luther King Jr. Day with history buffs, and celebrate by having a few speakers talk about the civil rights movement. The list is endless. Think outside the box. Find a discipline on campus you are curious about, and your creativity can lead you to know what it is that you need to do.<br><br>University life can be challenging. If your mind hurts from studying and your heart hurts because your mind is stuck and you don't have time for any of the above, then just step outside. Mount Timpanogos will always be there to greet you. A small break to smell the roses will clear the air and remind you of the great Creator. There will always be something in nature to stimulate creativity in your heart and mind if you look for it.<br><br>Creativity has an almost magical property that I found best stated by the poet Maya Angelou: "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."<sup>12</sup> The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us that this is truth: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day."<sup>13</sup><br><br>If you don't feel you have an ounce of ­creativity, then go to the Lord and petition Him. Creativity is your birthright. He will help you find the ore to make the tools. He can magnify you beyond what you ever thought was possible. He will help you to meet the full measure of your creation because it is everything He made you for. He will not only show you your gifts, but we learn from the story of the brother of Jared that He will be able to reveal Himself to you if you come to Him in faith and invite Him to be a part of the collaboration. Inviting creativity into your professional and private lives is worth searching and striving for; don't ever give up.<br><br>I have a strong testimony that being creative is one of the most important things we have come to this life to practice. We are here to have familial relationships, make good choices, and gain a body but also to find our soul, or what Wordsworth calls "our life's star."<sup>14</sup> May you be illuminated to find your internal angelic being who courageously chooses the Savior and chose to come to this world. By discovering and illuminating your celestial self, may you in turn illuminate others to find their own light. May the Lord bless you as you discover your creativity and spiritual gifts and as you strive to become who you were always meant to be. You will know it is the right path when the journey brings you closer to Him.<br><br>I have an abiding love for my Heavenly Father, the great Creator, and for His Son. Their love, artistry, and creativity are ­endless--as Ihope ours someday will also be.<br><br>I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Claudine Bigelow was a BYU professor of viola and associate director and graduate coordinator for the School of Music when this devotional was delivered on 4 August 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>e Manner of Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I express my sincere gratitude and pleasure on receiving the degree of doctor of science and Christian service from Brigham Young University. I am not an alumnus of BYU. As I look back fifty-five years to when I visited the campus for the first time, I wish that I had received my undergraduate education at BYU. As I receive this distinguished degree, I join my wife and our two sons in having a degree from BYU.<br><br>I offer a few thoughts to the graduates as you embark on your life prepared by the degree from BYU that you will receive today.<br><h2><b>Become a Scholar for Life</b></h2><br>As I began my studies leading to the degree of doctor of medicine, the dean of the medical school met with the students. He said:<br><br><i>You are graduate students and are expected to learn on your own by your own effort. We will help you learn, but we will not spoon-feed you. We have a library of medicine. I would suggest that you go there, take a book from the shelves, read from it, andlearn.</i><br><br>Today all of this information is available onthe Internet, so it is easy to be studying and learning all of your life.<br><br>Resolve any conflict that you may have in your mind regarding scientifically based knowledge and knowledge that comes from the gifts of the Spirit. Remember the words ofIsaiah:<br><br><i>Whom shall he teach knowledge? ...</i><br><br><i>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.</i> [Isaiah 28:9–10]<br><br>When one comes to the understanding that all knowledge has its origin with God and is given to man incrementally for the benefit of humankind, there is no conflict between science and gifts of the Spirit. We then qualify toreceive new knowledge and recognize it rightfully as a gift from God.<br><h2><b>Select Great Mentors and Follow Their Ways</b></h2><br>On the first day of my training to become a heart surgeon with Dr. John W. Kirklin, one of the pioneers of the use of the heart-lung machine, he stated emphatically: "Try to do everything exactly as I do it!" At first I thought him to be arrogant, but as I considered more thoughtfully what he had said, I realized if I were ever to approach his excellence as a cardiac surgeon, it was incumbent upon me tofollow his ways as accurately and precisely as possible.<br><br>President Russell M. Nelson, then Doctor Nelson, invited me to work with him in the practice of cardiovascular surgery. His environment was one in which honesty and doing what is right were the principles that guided all personal and professional relationships. Intellectual honesty means never leaving anything to chance. Intellectual dishonesty means thinking it will be okay when you know all is not right. Doing what is right means always taking the high road even if it is more difficult and less politically expedient.<br><h2><b>Find Ways to Provide Christian Service</b></h2><br>It has been easy for me as a medical doctor to provide service to others in time of need. It has been my responsibility to be available to the sick and afflicted. Illness does not have a calendar or a clock--there are no weekends, and illness frequently attacks late in the night. Medicine as a profession requires that we work when there is a need and stay with it until the problem is resolved.<br><br>I have learned that the times I taught and provided my skills as a surgeon without compensation to those living in deprived conditions were the most rewarding experiences of my professional life. Teaching and operating in hospitals in China, Russia, Latvia, and Ukraine not only provided care for people in need but also advanced quality of care provided by the dedicated doctors working and doing their best with what little they had in those hospitals.<br><br>It may seem strange for me to speak of the end of a career that you have not even started. The reality is that your productive life working for compensation is limited and the time will pass too soon until you retire to the life of a pensioner. You may then choose a life of full-time play or full-time rest. I would suggest that it is better to prolong your career by continuing to use your talents in service to others.<br><br>When I left the rigor of the operating room, I was called to senior missionary service with my wife, Cheryl. We served full-time in the Missionary Department for nine years, organizing and supporting hundreds of volunteer health professionals responsible for the health and safety of more than 83,000 missionaries serving in missions worldwide. It was a second career for me, requiring study and learning in order to advise proper care for afflicted missionaries. I observed the deep concern of the Brethren of the Twelve and the Seventy whenever a missionary was seriously injured or ill. It was a blessing to observe divine intervention saving missionaries when we had done all that wecould.<br><br>Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, ­provided the ultimate example of service to others. Throughout His ministry, as He went about teaching His gospel, He blessed and healed the sick and afflicted. Interestingly, many of the healing miracles of Jesus Christ were accomplished on the Sabbath. There were many times that I had to work on Sundays, holidays, or other inconvenient times, and I could have used my profession as an excuse not to serve in the Church and for other worthy causes. The blessings that accompany pure Christian service given whenever there is need, however, are so wonderful that any personal sacrifice should be made to receive them. As we serve others after the manner taught by Jesus Christ, we feel His love and focus our lives on becoming more like Him. In His name, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald B. Doty, MD, thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon, received an honorary doctorate when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2015.</i>

<h1>vidual Stewardship - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Statistics was a difficult class for me. I didn't know how important it would be for me later on when I started doing research, so I didn't feel like I needed to give the course work much attention or dedication.<br><br>So naturally I felt uncomfortable when my professor began class one day exhorting us to consider the time, tithes, donations, and support given to contribute to our individual learning. I don't remember what he said exactly, but he suggested we honor those contributions by taking our education--even the smallest assignment--more seriously.<br><br>For the first time since I had arrived, I recognized within myself a feeling of entitlement--<br>a mentality that I had earned my time here at BYU through my own efforts. This way of thinking had cheapened my education and led me to disregard the sacrifices that others had made to help me.<br><br>In his first encyclical, Pope John Paul II warned that we tend "to see no other meaning in [our] natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption."<sup>1</sup> He was focusing primarily on our stewardship over nature. But I think this idea can be applied to our perspective on almost anything. We often only find meaning in things to the point that we can use them for our gain.<br><br>This had become my mentality. Classes were valuable if they were entertaining or if they somehow furthered my personal interests. Anything beyond that was just another frustrating requirement that I had to get out of the way. I had stopped trying to find meaning in things if they didn't seem relevant to me at that exact moment. Even worse, I felt that I was justified in feeling this way because, after all, I had earned my time here. I should be able to use it as I liked.<br><br>But by thinking this way I had been hampering my progress as well as that of others. When we think of our opportunities as being owed to us, a pure and sacred source of motivation is lost. The truth is, we have been greatly blessed, and--for the most part--­without any deservedness of ourselves. Our education and the degrees denoting it, which we will receive tomorrow, are blessings from God and thus are ultimately another aspect of the stewardship that God has assigned each of us.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 104:13, Christ revealed:<br><br><i>It is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures.</i><br><br>We can now choose to use that stewardship as God directs us or use it for our personal pleasure and gain.<br><br>More important, let us consider this question: How has God directed us to use our stewardship?<br><br>Following the murder of his brother Abel, Cain was confronted by the Lord: "Where is Abel thy brother?"<br><br>Cain responded with a question that points toward the purpose of our stewardship as ­disciples of Christ: "Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9).<br><br>Zygmunt Bauman, paraphrasing the ­philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, said:<br><br><i>From</i> [this] <i>question all immorality began. Of course I am my brother's keeper; and I am and remain a moral person as long as I do not ask for a special reason to be one. Whether I admit it or not, I am my brother's keeper because my brother's well-being </i><b><i>depends</i></b><i> on what I do or refrain from doing. And I am a moral person because I recognize that dependence and accept the responsibility that follows. ... </i><i>My brother's dependence is what makes me an ethical being. Dependence and ethics stand together and together they fall.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I would hope that everyone here has a desire to be moral individuals. I believe that the Honor Code that we have tried our best to uphold points us in that very direction. The root of morality, according to Levinas and Bauman, is recognizing our role as our ­brothers' and sisters' keepers. Everything else--living the commandments, dedicating ourselves to our education, and drawing closer to God in any way--serves as a way to increase our awareness of that role, our desire to fulfill it, and our ability to do so.<br><br>Since that day in my statistics class and throughout approximately 100 hours of course work and a full-time mission, the Lord has continued to teach me in small ways that this concept is real--that my choices directly and indirectly sway all within my sphere of influence and many beyond that sphere and that, ultimately, I <i>am</i> my brother's keeper.<br><br>Consider your degree. You are now equipped not just to make more money or provide for your future family--though these things are important--but also to be a better steward. This is a common mantra, both within the Church and around the world. You have been given greater power, knowledge, and capacity.<br><br>You now have greater responsibility.<br><br>Whenever anyone hears that I am in the landscape management program, they always seem to have something that they need help with--deciding what kind of shrub to plant on the shady side of their house or figuring out how to treat the aphids on their plum tree. In these small ways I can work toward fulfilling my stewardship.<br><br>Likewise, I guarantee that from here on out you will be faced with opportunities to use this power--both to get gain and, in other cases, to lift and help those around you. Which type of opportunity will motivate your choices and color your perspective?<br><br>I would like to finish with a few verses from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And I consecrate unto them this</i> [opportunity] <i>for a little season, until I, the Lord, shall provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence;</i><br><br><i>And the hour and the day is not given unto them, wherefore let them act upon this</i> ­[opportunity] <i>as for years, and this shall turn unto them for their good. ...</i><br><br><i>And whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.</i><br><br><i>Verily, I say unto you, I am Jesus Christ, who cometh quickly, in an hour you think not.

<h1>es to Emulate: To Do and To Be: - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Elder Oaks, for your very important address. My wife, Wendy, had planned to be with us today. Unfortunately, she sprained her ankle and is propped up at home watching these proceedings on TV. She was on the faculty here for thirteen years. We love BYU. She joins me in extending our heartfelt congratulations to all graduates and their families. We are especially grateful for the excellent messages given by three of the leading lights of this dispensation: President Kevin J Worthen, Dr. Donald B. Doty, and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.<br><br>President Worthen stands tall in his position as the thirteenth president of the university. He excelled in his chosen field of law and once served as dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and as advancement vice president at BYU. In the Church he serves as an Area Seventy. We trust him. His peers look up to him. His students emulate him.<br><br>Dr. Donald B. Doty is regarded across the globe as the premiere teacher of cardiac surgery. His textbooks are used by specialists throughout the world. You will want to read every word of his amazing biographical summary in your commencement program. While excelling in his profession, he has served in the Church as bishop, stake president, regional representative, and Area Seventy. Later we called upon him to direct the medical affairs of the Missionary Department, which he did as a volunteer for nine years. We are most grateful for his and Cheryl's building a network of help for our missionaries that will endure for years. We love them and salute them today, particularly Brother Doty as he gets his honorary degree. No one could be more deserving.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks and I were called to the Quorum of the Twelve in April 1984. It has been my rare privilege to sit beside him in our quorum meetings for more than thirty-one years. You know of Elder Oaks' past service as the eighth president of BYU and as a justice of the supreme court of the state of Utah. Today you heard him talk about your need to take heart. He also asked you to consider what God wants you to be: to be joyful, to be creative, and to develop a love of God that will bring you a fulness of joy.<br><br>Now, let me share a thought for you graduates. You are entering a new phase of life. To this point you have been striving to meet expectations imposed upon you by other people. You have passed exams and may have to pass others in order to become certified. You have been jumping over high hurdles established by others. In order to prepare for what you want to do in life, this is good. But with this transition in the pursuit of your formal education, you need to continue to focus on becoming the person the Lord needs you to be. Strive to develop the spiritual attributes of faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence.<br><br>These attributes are difficult to measure, but they constitute the substance of what the Lord hopes for each of you. Remember His counsel posed to us as a question: "What manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>Each day we can become more like Him, regardless of our chosen field of occupational endeavor. That is the lesson I would like you to learn from leaders like President Worthen, Dr. Doty, and Elder Oaks. With each passing day they have worked hard to become more like the Lord. You, too, can do as they have done. You, too, can leave a legacy of faith in your families to bless generations yet unborn.<br><br>Now, with the apostolic authority vested in Elder Oaks and me, we would like to bless you with joy, health, and wisdom to sustain you throughout your lifetime of opportunity, with success in your educational and occupational pursuits and within your families. We bless you in your Church service to participate joyfully in building up the kingdom of God upon the earth. We so bless you, with our expression of heartfelt love and gratitude for each one of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2015.</i>

<h1>raduation: Elder Oaks&#039;s 2015 August Commencement Address</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, a commencement exercise is a happy time for graduates, for parents, for friends, for teachers, and for the administration. It is a time to celebrate past accomplishments and to certify graduates' progress from one status to another. For them, it is a rite of passage, like a christening, a baptismal service, a coming-out party, or a wedding reception.<br><br>But the gaining of knowledge and skills is an incomplete view of the significance of education. Of even greater importance is the question of how those attainments are to be used. That is the question sought to be answered by graduation speakers. Our function, as one has said, is "to hold you here long enough to let solemnity sink in."<sup>1</sup><br><br><b>I.</b><br><br>You graduate in challenging times: wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis, and the prospects of financial disasters. More important, values and standards honored for thousands of years are now being denied or cast aside. Selfishness is replacing service. The fundamental freedoms of speech and religion are being questioned. Evil is being called good and good is being called evil.<br><br>Though men's hearts are failing them, you should take heart. There have always been challenging times. We, the generations of your predecessors, have survived daunting challenges, and so will you. The answer to all of these challenges is the same as it has always been. We have a Savior, and He has taught us what we should do. At the conclusion of His earthly ministry He declared: "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>As His witness I testify that His teachings are true and that the way He has marked out is the way to peace in this world and everlasting life in the world to come.<br><br><b>II.</b><br><br>Foremost among the things you should remember from your years at BYU are the teachings you have received about the things of eternity and the principles of right and wrong that have been up front in your religion classes and pervasive in many others.<br><br>At Brigham Young University we like to quote the teachings of the founder, President Brigham Young. He spoke as an extraordinarily wise leader and he also spoke as a prophet. He taught this about the purpose ofeducation in the gospel of Jesus Christ:<br><br><i>All our educational pursuits are in the service of God, for all these labors are to establish truth on the earth, and that we may increase in knowledge, wisdom, understanding in the power of faith and in the wisdom of God, that we may become fit subjects to dwell in a higher state of existence and intelligence than we now enjoy.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>In teaching the Saints how to conduct their lives in harmony with the gospel in a world that pursues other values, Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The man or woman who enjoys the spirit of our ­religion has no trials; but the man or woman who tries to live according to the Gospel of the Son of God, and at the same time clings to the spirit of the world, has trials and sorrows acute and keen, and that, too, continually.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Truly, as the Savior taught, we cannot "serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).<br><br>Brigham Young had an inclusive attitude toward his fellowmen that each of us should understand and emulate in a world in which many do not share our values:<br><br><i>It has never altered my feelings towards individuals, as men or as women, whether they believe as I do or not. Can you live as neighbours with me? I can with you; and it is no particular concern of mine whether you believe with me or not.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>He also said:<br><br><i>Our religion ... is adapted to the capacity of the whole human family. It does not send a portion of the people to howl in torment for ever and ever, but it reaches after the last son and daughter of Adam and Eve, and will pluck them from the prison, unlock the doors, and burst the bonds and bring forth every soul who will receive salvation.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Finally, you should of course remember the needed fraction of all you have learned here. But even more important, you should remember that those whose sacrifices have supported your education expect you to use that education in the service of your fellowmen and in furtherance of your own becoming what God created you to become.<br><br><b>III.</b><br><br>Father Lehi taught that the children of God exist "that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). That great truth is fundamental to our philosophy of life. The kind of joy referred to in the scriptures is not the happiness we experience in temporary rushes of pleasure, such as we enjoy in today's recognitions. The joy that is the purpose of our existence is intense and enduring. We may properly say that it is eternal.<br><br>Where do we find our greatest joy? I suggest that it is in creativity--the process and feeling of creating something. Mothers have surely realized that kind of joy, and fathers too, though to a lesser extent--at least at the beginning.<br><br>Creativity in business or in a profession is the same for men and for women. I am not qualified to speak of the joys of creativity in establishing a business or in the practice of medicine or musicianship, but I have some idea of creativity in the practice of law. Much of the practice of law is repetitive drudgery, but there are moments of joy in a new insight or in producing a good piece of legal work, like a letter of opinion. I have also experienced joy in various kinds of English composition as I have tried to express a thought or explain a principle as clearly and persuasively as possible.<br><br>You will recognize similar examples of the joy of creativity in other lines of work. Surely the process of cultivating living things and seeing them come to maturity and harvest creates joy in farmers and in teachers. There is also joy in writing or in creating a work of art or in a performance that brings one of these to life for an audience. And overarching all of these is the joy we experience in many forms of service to our fellowman, as Dr. Doty has explained so persuasively and has so effectively demonstrated inhis life.<br><br>But all of these illustrations are only mortal or temporary examples of the joy of creativity. We have no assurance that most of the things that bring us joy in mortality will continue in the next life. The diploma you have received this day is but one example.<br><br>I believe that our greatest joy is found through the gospel of Jesus Christ, which explains our origin as spirits, the creation of the world, our purpose in mortality, and our destiny in eternity. Explanations of the plan of salvation often use the word <i>joy.</i> When the foundations of the world were laid, we spirits "shouted for joy" (Job 38:7). The announcement of the Savior's birth was a message "of great joy" (Luke 2:10). His Atonement and Resurrection fill us "with great joy" (Alma 4:14). The love of God is described as "the most desirable above all things" and "the most joyous to the soul" (1 Nephi 11:22, 23). Finally, the Savior Himself described the experience of returning to dwell with God as a "fulness of joy" (3 Nephi 28:10; D&amp;amp;C 93:33).<br><br>The gospel's assurance of a continued embodied existence after this life illuminates our understanding of the ultimate joy of creativity. A favorite illustration of that truth is the Lord's great explanation that His work and His glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Surely our greatest eternal joy will be in the creativity that lives beyond this mortal life and gives joy after the Resurrection and throughout all eternity. That is why, as God has revealed, "eternal life ... is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>And so I come to this vital advice to you graduates: Treasure and enlarge your family connections. Cherish and use your opportunities for creativity in eternal marriage. And value your friendships and opportunities for service, for those efforts can also be eternal.<br><br><b>IV.</b><br><br>I conclude with an additional thought, which is important to all of us.<br><br>During His journey across Samaria, Jesus rested at Jacob's well. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water from that deep well, He asked her for a drink. She marveled that a Jew would speak to a Samaritan. Jesus replied that if she knew who He was, she would ask Him for living water. Seeing that Hehad no implement to draw water, she questioned how He could obtain any water togiveher.<br><br>Before we remind ourselves of His answer, we should note the similarity of this incident to our present circumstance. The Savior is in our midst, sometimes personally, frequently through His servants, and always by His Spirit. His power is such that He could obtain anything on this earth. He need not ask for water at the well, for tithes and offerings at the Church, or for service to His children. He asks us for these temporal things--just as He sought a drink from the woman at Jacob's well--so He can bless us with something of far greater importance than what we give.<br><br>In answer to the Samaritan woman's ­question, Jesus said:<br><br><i>Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</i><br><br><i>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i> [John 4:13–14]<br><br>On this graduation day it is appropriate to think of your education and your degree as implements that can draw water from a deep well. You can use those implements to satisfy thirst and other earthly desires for yourself and those dependent upon you. On occasion they can also be used to provide earthly support for the Savior and His work and His servants. But we must never forget what the Savior told the Samaritan woman: "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again." Only from Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior of this world, can we obtain the living water whose partaker shall never thirst again, in whom it will be "a well of water springing up into everlasting life."<br><br>Jesus taught us how to obtain the living water that springs up into eternal life. Even as we celebrate our ability to draw water from Jacob's well or other mortal replenishments, we should remember that these other sources are insignificant in value beside what we can obtain from Jesus' teachings, His atoning sacrifice, His commandments, and the covenants we make with Him. Even as you value the mortal progress we celebrate this day, do not forget that eternal reality, of which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H.

<h1> What Our Heavenly Father Wants Us to Be - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What an awesome sight to look over this blue sea of BYU graduates! You have just graduated from one of the world's greatest universities. My name is Terry Seamons, president of the BYU Alumni Association. One privilege that is mine as alumni president is to officially welcome you into our BYU Alumni Association. So I hereby confer upon each of you a lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 410,000 living alumni. You will have many opportunities over the years to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with this university.<br><br>The mission of BYU "is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life."<sup>1</sup> This mission does not end today at graduation. Your learning doesn't end, your quest doesn't end, and our relationship doesn't end. Our mission as alumni is to extend this marvelous BYU experience beyond graduation and build lifelong relationships with our alumni and friends. Consider those spiritual and temporal lessons that you have learned here. We hope that you will treasure these great lessons and stay connected for good throughout the rest of your lives.<br><br>Check in with us from time to time and let us know what you are doing and how you are doing. Through our alumni campaign--we call it RISE--we have begun collecting the stories of more than 6,700 of our former students. Here is just one of them.<br><br>Arizona graduate Duane Oakes initially struggled to find his place at BYU. With only a few friends and no family nearby, he was contemplating returning home when he met a student-government advisor who told him he wasn't going anywhere because she was going to mentor him. As he was helped, he discovered that he had a passion for helping other students and became involved. Through an educational career he has devoted himself to keeping the legacy going of the things he learned at BYU. He stayed involved.<br><br>Now Duane serves on the faculty of Mesa Community College and directs the Center for Community and Civic Engagement. He and his wife now lead the Arizona BYU Alumni Chapter in Phoenix. We love his story. We would love to hear your stories, and we invite you to share them at rise.byu.edu.<br><br>You are now entering another phase of your eternal progression. We hope your experiences at the Y have opened your eyes to future possibilities. Understand that none of us has "arrived." We are all in a process of "becoming." As you know, that process is fraught with trials and tests. But fundamental to this process is our belief in the fact that we <i>can</i> become what our Heavenly Father wants us tobe.<br><br>Let me share a favorite story: <i>Hope for the Flowers</i> by Trina Paulus. This is a story of how two cater­pillars traversed the trials and risks in their lives to become beautiful butterflies. It started with discovering what a butterfly was and finding that they were meant to become butter­flies. Each had to come to grips with the question "How can I believe there's a butterfly inside you or me when all I see is a fuzzy worm?"<br><br>"How does one become a butterfly?" one caterpillar asked the other. The reply was ­classic: "You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar."<br><br>Does that concept sound familiar? The caterpillars began making cocoons, but they realized how big a step it was since they would never be able to return to caterpillar life. The insight of the author is then found in the following statement: "During the change, it will seem to you or to anyone who might peek that nothing is happening--but the butterfly is already becoming. It just takes time!"<br><br>As the first caterpillar was about to close up his cocoon, he said to the other, "You'll be a beautiful ­butterfly--we're all waiting for you!" For courage, the second caterpillar hung right beside the first cocoon and began to spin her own. The author's final message is found in this inspirational statement: "Imagine, I didn't even know I could do this. That's some encouragement that I'm on the right track. If I have inside me the stuff to make cocoons--maybe the stuff of butterflies is there too."<sup>2</sup><br><br>You have the stuff, my brothers and sisters, to become all that Heavenly Father wants--to be like Him and to dwell with Him eternally. Itis my prayer that each of you will realize this God-given promise and continue your quest to become that beautiful butterfly. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Terry R.

<br>
I extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes to each of the graduates today. Graduation is properly a time of celebration--a time to rejoice in the success you have all achieved in earning your degree. It is also properly a time to look forward to what lies ahead--that is in part why we call this ­ceremony a commencement.<br><br>Many of you will go immediately into your first post-college full-time job. Others will head to graduate school. Some will dedicate themselves to the full-time pursuit of raising children. Each of these new adventures will likely be challenging, stimulating, and, in a few cases, close to all consuming--in ways that may cause you tolose perspective.<br><br>As you begin this next phase of your life, especially the majority of you who will eventually spend most of your waking hours in a career outside the home, I ask you to reflect on the words of Os Guinness, who astutely observed that, in today's society,<br><br><i>work takes up so many of our waking hours that </i><b><i>our jobs come to define us and give us our ­identities. We become what we do.</i></b><sup>1</sup><br><br>The world would often teach us that <i>we are what we do.</i> It does not take long in most social gatherings to realize this. One of the first questions that is asked when meeting a new person in a professional setting is "What do you do?" The answer to that question not only determines the subject and length of the ensuing conversation but also often creates the identity of the respondent from that point on.<br><br>Guinness urges us to not fall into the trap of defining ourselves by our jobs but instead to view our jobs--indeed, our entire lives--as a calling and to choose our jobs and how we fulfill them by determining who we are. In his words:<br><br><i>Calling reverses</i> [the world's] <i>thinking. ... Instead of, "You are what you do," calling says: "Dowhat you are.</i><i>"</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I urge you to consider this concept as you move ahead with your lives, because who you are is extraordinary--"beloved ... son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents" with "a divine nature and destiny."<sup>3</sup> And as a result of who you are--and who you can become--you can have a profound impact on those around you, not only in your jobs but also in your communities and, most important, in your homes.<br><br>Because you have lived in the unique environment that is Brigham Young University for the past few years, you may overlook the depth of the impact that those who become what the university and the gospel urge them to become can have on others on this campus.<br><br>In 2005, Naomi Schaeffer Riley wrote a book about religiously affiliated universities in the United States. The book is entitled <i>God on the Quad.</i> Riley began her book describing a speech given by author Tom Wolfe at a Class Day address at Harvard in which Wolfe described our current time frame as "the era of the 'fifth freedom'--freedom from religion."<sup>4</sup> In a subsequent interview, Wolfe observed that in our society there has been a removal of what he called this "last hobble" onour freedom.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Having grown up in an environment that largely shared this very secularized view, Riley was intrigued by the increase in popularity of religiously affiliated universities, and she set out, in a somewhat skeptical manner, to visit some of those universities in order to explore what she called "the missionary generation" at America's religiously affiliated universities.<br><br>Her first visit was to BYU. She arrived on campus on September 10, 2001, the day before the date we now refer to as simply 9/11. She described what happened as the events of 9/11 unfolded:<br><br><i>I began the first formal interviews for this book on September 10, 2001. The next day, two thousand miles from home, I sat on the edge of my hotel bed, looking out over the strip malls to the treeless </i><i>mountains beyond, wondering more than anything</i><i> else about how to get home. Home for me is Blue America. I have lived in four states, all in the northeast. I attended two secular colleges and grew up with a sense that religion, while socially beneficial ..., was not true. In other words, I had already expected to feel distinctly out of place on these campuses. And the events of that Tuesday morning only intensified the feeling.</i><br><br><i>Over the next week, the students at Brigham Young</i> [University] <i>tried to welcome me into their lives. While national tragedies tend to bring out the best in many people, the first representatives of the "missionary generation" I encountered </i><b><i>could not have made a greater impression upon me.</i></b><i> Their kindness and compassion, their civic-mindedness, their understanding and interest in national and international affairs, the quiet comfort they were able to find in their faith, and their ability to relate to this stranger in their midst gave me cause for optimism.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>These BYU students had a profound impact on Riley because they understood who they really were, and they were able to communicate that to her in a way that we may not always discern since we are already here. You can have a similar impact on those around you if you understand and realize who you reallyare.<br><br>After describing her initial experience at BYU, Riley continued her introduction to the book by writing:<br><br><i>At the end of his Class Day address, Tom Wolfe worried that the "religious self-discipline that ran through the American people from one side to the other" and held this country together through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has now disappeared. Wolfe predicted that the twenty-first century would be a period of "revaluation," in which we will have to "create an entirely new ethical and moral framework." Searching for a person who</i> "[could] <i>lead mankind into</i> [such] <i>a new era," Wolfe asked his audience, "Where else should we find such a person but at Harvard?</i><i>"</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Riley then asked, tellingly, in the last words of her introduction, "Where else, indeed?"<sup>8</sup> Herunwritten--but clear--answer is perhaps at places like BYU.<br><br>As you begin this next phase of your lives, do not underestimate your potential for good in the world. Many in the world are searching for the kind of competence, compassion, and vision you have developed as a result of the gifts God has given you, including your education here. If you will remember who you are--sons and daughters of heavenly parents with a divine purpose for your lives--you will find that who you are will define everything you do and that the things you do will make aprofound difference in the world.<br><br>May it be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 13 August 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am humbled to stand before you. Many of you will know that the First Presidency originally assigned Elder L. Tom Perry to speak here today. I am honored to stand in his place.<br><br>In the past ninety days we have witnessed, as President Russell M. Nelson likes to say, "the graduation" of two extraordinary Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. President Boyd K. Packer was made a General Authority just after my tenth birthday. Elder L. Tom Perry was ordained an Apostle before my wife, Kathy, and I were married, when we were students here at Brigham Young University. For more than forty years they sat together in the Quorum of the Twelve, and for more than half of that time they sat next to one another. President Packer, with a smile, would say that the Lord put Elder Perry next to him to kick him in the ankles when he got out of line.<br><br>During those many decades they moved across the world and used every opportunity to testify of the divine mission of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the restoration of His gospel. And as they bore witness of Him, He refined them, purified them, and sanctified them. President Packer, who was by his nature a very private man, would lament at times that members of the Quorum of the Twelve were destined to die onstage.<br><br>President Packer had a very quick wit. One Thursday morning before our meeting began in the temple, Elder Perry was conversing with me at the junior end of the semicircle of chairs. President Packer, speaking in a cheerful voice so all could hear, said, "Tom, come up here where you belong. Ten good men have died to put you in this chair."<br><br>They both moved through the veil with dignity and spiritual power.<br><br>On the week that Elder Perry passed away, he attended our meeting on Tuesday. On Tuesday night, as recorded by his son, Lee, he had a spiritual experience that let him know his time was soon.<sup>1</sup><br><br>With Elder Russell M. Nelson on assignment in eastern Europe, Elder Perry, on Wednesday morning, called Elder Oaks and Elder Ballard to his apartment. He told them his time was short and that he would not be coming back into the office. He recorded a six-minute message for the Quorum of the Twelve, telling us he loved us, encouraging us in the work ahead, and bearing his sure witness of the Savior. We were sobered as that recording was played for us Thursday morning in the temple.<br><br>The First Presidency went Thursday afternoon to say their good-byes to their dear friend. Elder Nelson called Elder Perry from Bulgaria Thursday evening. On Friday morning President Packer rose from his feeble ­condition and traveled to Elder Perry's apartment to say good-bye. They reflected on their many years together. President Packer reminded him that Elder Perry had always said that he wanted to go through the veil at least one day before President Packer. They rejoiced that they would soon see each other on the other side.<br><br>On Friday afternoon, just after 4:00 p.m., Kathy and I had the chance to visit with Elder and Sister Perry. Elder Perry was sitting in a comfortable chair, weak but conversant. He asked us, as he did all the members of the Twelve, to watch over and care for his dear Barbara. He expressed his love for us and we expressed our love for him. I told him that in a few years, as I followed him out of this earthly experience, I hoped he would be there to greet me. He promised that, if given permission, he would. He told us he would do all that he could to bless our work from the other side of the veil.<br><br>Less than twenty-four hours later he stepped through the veil. Thirty-four days later President Packer followed him. I, with you, revere these two disciples of Christ. I confirm to you that they were honest men, holy men--devoted to the callings that they had received and full of the pure love of Christ. I testify that we will yet see them again.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, we live in very interesting times. Here are some selected statistics from recent studies:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Worldwide there has been a 35 percent increase in terrorist attacks in the past year.<sup>2</sup></li><br> 	<li>In 2013, 41 percent of all births in the United States were to unmarried women, compared to 18 percent thirty-five years ago.<sup>3</sup></li><br> 	<li>Adult Americans claiming no religious affiliation increased from 16 percent in 2007 to 23 percent in 2014.<sup>4</sup></li><br> 	<li>Nearly seven in ten Americans say doctors should be legally allowed to assist terminally ill patients in committing suicide.<sup>5</sup></li><br> 	<li>There are now more than 43 million refugees worldwide, displaced from their homes because of conflict or persecution.<sup>6</sup></li><br></ul><br>And how about this very recent concerning headline: "California College Will Now Ask Students to Pick from Six [Different] Genders" in their application for admission.<sup>7</sup><br><br>And this one: "Another Day, Another Mass Shooting in America."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Finally, this sobering headline: "Why Selling Baby Parts Should Shock No One."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Let me close with a happy headline from the <i>Washington Post:</i> "World's Youngest Double Hand Transplant Recipient 'Woke up Smiling.'"<sup>10</sup><br><br>As I said, we live in very interesting times, yet marvelous times. We are in the dispensation of the fulness of times, when the fulness of the gospel has been restored and as the world is being prepared for the glorious Second Coming of the Savior. These are days of looking forward, of beautiful anticipation. These are our days.<br><br>We know as we approach the Second Coming of the Savior that our world will be full of commotion and confusion. Many in society will disregard the commandments of God. I have often quoted this statement by President Thomas S. Monson: "Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and it's growing ever wider."<sup>11</sup><br><br>As these temptations and distractions increase and as the gospel of Jesus Christ becomes less palatable to the world, sadly we will see more among us who will lose their way.<br><br>When I was a young man growing up in southeastern Idaho, I remember frequently hearing a quote from Elder Heber C. Kimball given in 1867:<br><br><i>To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves. The difficulties will be of such a character that the man or woman who does not possess this personal knowledge or witness will fall. ...</i><br><br><i>... The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>More than ever in the sixty-four years of my life, this prophetic statement by Elder Kimball is coming to pass. Deep, continuing conversion is becoming much more important for those desiring to keep their covenants. It is becoming more and more precarious to stand on ­borrowed light.<br><br>You may think that my message is sounding a little gloomy, but stay with me. Hope is on the way.<br><br>The Lord has long anticipated this important period of human history. He knows the end from the beginning. The Savior has assured us in our day, "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you."<sup>13</sup><br><br>As we find our way in a world less attentive to the commandments of God, we will certainly be prayerful, but we need not be overly alarmed. The Lord will bless His Saints with the added spiritual power necessary to meet the challenges of our day.<br><br>Here is my major theme this morning: As evil increases in the world, there is a compensatory spiritual power for the righteous. As the world slides from its spiritual moorings, the Lord prepares the way for those who seek Him, offering them greater assurance, greater confirmation, and greater confidence in the spiritual direction they are traveling. The gift of the Holy Ghost becomes a brighter light in the emerging twilight.<br><br>To understand better, think of these comparisons: If the world were growing more physically dark, He could give us enhanced night vision. If loud noises were constantly in our ears, He could give us a filtering mechanism to block the unwanted sound. If the race we were running was extended, He could give us increased lung and muscle capacity. If the exam we were taking was more difficult, He could quicken our minds--a blessing many here at BYU would like to receive.<br><br>My brothers and sisters, as evil increases in the world, there is a compensatory power, an additional spiritual endowment, a revelatory gift for the righteous.<br><br>This added blessing of spiritual power does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It is willingly offered to us; it is eagerly put before us. But as with all spiritual gifts, it requires our desiring it, pursuing it, and living worthy of receiving it. "For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?"<sup>14</sup><br><br>Faith is the muscle of spiritual knowledge and power. Faith is a spiritual gift of God, but it is developed and magnified as we eagerly pursue our journey of embracing and following the Savior. I remember once long ago, before I was serving as a General Authority, having a man approach me whom I had known for some time in business. We talked about a challenge he was facing in his life, and I gave him some of my thoughts.<br><br>He then said to me, "Neil, you have something I don't have. You have faith in God."<br><br>The way he said it to me, I sensed he felt that having faith was not something chosen or determined by me or by him but that somewhere in the lottery of life my gene pool had brought a quality of believing and trusting in God that his gene pool had not. This, my brothers and sisters, is not a correct notion of faith in God or faith in Christ. And you believe it above all others because you are here at Campus Education Week.<br><br>Let us have confidence in the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ to lift us and to lift those we love to greater heights. One of President Packer's favorite scriptures was in Alma 31--and he would read it to us in the way I will read it to you:<br><br><i>As the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had</i> [a] <i>more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought itwas expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>There is virtue in the word of God. There is power in the testimony of Jesus Christ. There is truth in the Savior's gospel. It will shape us and mold us as we allow its powerful effects tomove upon our mind and upon our spirit.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father desires that faith will grow within the hearts of all His sons and daughters. As one repents, opens her heart, or seeks to strengthen his faith, the Lord is magnanimous and generous in return. Alma said, "Remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name."<sup>16</sup> You of course will remember that Alma talked about arousing our faculties, experimenting upon the words of Christ, and exercising faith to give additional place for faith to grow.<sup>17</sup><br><br>Never forget that the seed must be nourished. We need to help those we love to understand that faith is not stagnant. It is either growing or it is diminishing. We have all been taught these things. Faith grows by repentance and obedience, by prayer and scripture study, by attending Church and taking the sacrament, and by serving and associating with other believers.<br><br>I emphasize once again: As evil increases in the world, the Lord does not leave us on the same footing. In a world that would diminish or discard or impair belief, there is an added spiritual power for those who are willing tosettheir course on increasing their faith inJesus Christ.<br><br>Let me give you three examples from our world today that reveal the Lord's hand at work in bringing more spiritual power to His Saints.<br><br>It has only been in the last few years that technology has allowed us to link our generations more completely. A year and a half ago we gave the challenge to the youth to bring as many names to the temple as baptisms they perform in the temple.<br><br>Elder Samuel Hepworth, a missionary in the Chile Concepción Mission, wrote me justlast month, explaining the spiritual power of finding his ancestors. He began his letter this way:<br><br><i>Dear Elder Andersen,</i><br><br><i>I know that I am not to write the apostles directly, but my mission president gave me permission.</i><br><br><i>Thank you for</i> [the] <i>challenge from 2014. That changed my life completely.</i> [It] <i>was my catalyst to get me going on my own.</i> [My trips to the temple were] <i>made even more special by bringing my own names. . . . As I did my own work instead of just following my mom's instructions, I found a greater satisfaction than ever in the work, and the Spirit entered my life even stronger.</i><br><br><i>I have been sharing</i> [the challenge] <i>with all ofthe missionaries and members here in Chile. ... I have never seen more hearts turn to their fathers than is happening right now.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Along with Elder Hepworth, the youth of the Church have responded by the thousands and tens of thousands, and names submitted by youth have more than doubled since the challenge was issued only eighteen months ago. As the hearts of the children have turned to their fathers, the youth have been given an added gift of spiritual power. If you have not seen this yet in the youth, go to lds.org and read of their experiences or, better yet, talk to those youth who are in your family or who live near you. If you or members of your family have not committed yourselves to finding names from your family for your ordinances inthe temple, now is the time to begin.<br><br>Let me share a second example: In the twenty-two years that I have been serving as a General Authority of the Church, the number of temples has increased from forty-four to 147. In only twenty years the Lord has given us three times the number of temples.<sup>19</sup><br><br>Why is that? We now have temples closer and more accessible than ever before. But in these times of commotion the Lord expects us to adjust our habits and be in His house more often. Listen to these beautiful words by President Monson:<br><br><i>As we enter through the doors of the temple, we leave behind us the distractions and confusion of the world. Inside this sacred sanctuary, we find beauty and order. There is rest for our souls and a respite from the cares of our lives.</i><br><br><i>As we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality and a feeling of peace which will transcend any other feeling which could come into the human heart. We will grasp the true meaning of the words of the Savior when He said: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. ... Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). ...</i><br><br><i>My brothers and sisters, in our lives we will have temptations; we will have trials and challenges. As we go to the temple, as we remember the covenants we make there, we will be better able to overcome those temptations and to bear our trials. In the temple we can find peace.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Did you hear the promises from God's prophet? We will be better able to overcome temptations, bear our trials, and find peace.<br><br>Let me read you a letter from a very ­righteous woman who recently experienced a ­tragedy in her marriage that was not of her doing. She wrote:<br><br><i>I had a beautiful experience in the temple this morning. My husband and I usually went to the temple each year on our anniversary. I decided a week ago that it might be good for my emotional recovery to go to the temple even though, of course, he would not be with me on this day that we should have celebrated our twentieth anniversary.</i><br><br><i>For the past two years I have researched and done the ordinances for a family. In a miraculous series of events, around the time I first became involved in family history (after everything happened with my husband), I found a brother of my great-great-great-grandmother ... was missing from the family tree and had not had his temple work completed and had not been sealed to his parents although my grandfather had had the rest of the family's work completed years ago.</i><br><br><i>I asked my brother-in-law to do his temple work, and then I did the work for his wife. When I was completing the initiatory work, I felt her presence so strongly, and in my mind I heard her say the words "find my family," with the implied message to complete their temple work. Through researching I would discover that she had seven sons! Two had had their temple work done by others, but I was able to submit the information for the other five sons and their wives. My 17-year-old son did the baptisms for the sons, my brother-in-law did the initiatories, and my missionary son and his fellow missionaries did the endowments. My teenage daughter and I completed the ordinances for the sons' wives.</i><br><br><i>Even though all the preliminary ordinances had been done, because of my own marriage situation I had not wanted to go to the temple to participate in the sealings for this family. It was too painful. However, as time passed I have found that in the last few months I have been doing better and have been thinking about it. During the last few weeks especially, I have felt compelled to complete the sealings for this family. The work that needed to be done included sealing the woman whose words "find my family" had made such an impression on me as well as her two younger sisters to their parents.</i><br><br><i>So I made the decision I would go today, a day I celebrated my own wedding anniversary for so many years. I was very nervous, but I took courage. I have never done sealings in the temple without my husband, so this was really a new experience for me ... , but the reality is that it is now necessary for me to do many things requiring faith that I have never done before alone.</i><br><br><i>I felt very grateful for a kind and compassionate sealer in the temple today ... , and one of the other men in the session was our stake patriarch, who gave my son his patriarchal blessing. I don't think he recognized me, but having him there put me at ease. The temple workers were very nice to me, and I really appreciated it because (unknown to them)I was very nervous. I am sure the Lord knew how Ifelt.</i><br><br><i>Somewhat surprising to me, I deeply appreciated the time of sitting in the sealing room waiting for my turn and thinking about the blessings in the sealing ordinance as they were repeated over and over again. I participated in the last sealing of the session, acting as proxy for my great-great-great-great grandmother with her husband, as their son, Benjamin, missing from the family for so many years, was now sealed to them. I felt an overwhelming and unexpected feeling that they were there. It was a beautiful testament to me of the power of eternal families as, first, their son was sealed to them and then I acted as proxy for the woman whose words "find my family" had touched me so much, and our stake patriarch was proxy for the couple's five sons. They were then sealed, linking this family together. It was truly an amazing experience.</i><br><br><i> Afterward I went to the celestial room ... and had a few minutes to ponder on eternity alone--or maybe not alone--as I read 2 Kings 6:16, which speaks of unseen heavenly hosts that are at times "with us." I felt that feeling today in the temple.</i><br><br><i>On a hard day, I was not expecting this, but I'm sure it was a special blessing for me and another assurance in my life that I can move forward. ... I felt very blessed today in the temple! It gives me hope for happy days ahead.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Listen to the poetic words of my friend, Thomas L. Kay:<br><br><i>I will leave the tumult of the world.</i><br><i>I will leave the world behind.</i><br><i>I will go to where the Spirit is,</i><br><i>In God's temple I will find.</i><br><br><i>I will find the things the world can't give.</i><br><i>I'll escape this mortal strife.</i><br><i>I will find the things that matter most.</i><br><i>I will hear the words of life.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>The temple is an added gift from heaven to us. We need to embrace it with renewed dedication. Our children will need the temple even more in the years ahead. Teach them to love the temple. Help them to be ready to receive their endowment and eventually their sealing. Teach them how to prepare for these sacred ordinances and help them see how doing these ordinances will be a constant gift to them throughout their lives. As they do temple work, they will not only go through the temple but, as Brother Truman G. Madsen used to say, they will allow the temple to go through them.<sup>23</sup><br><br>Our world of technology and communication, with all of its distractions, provides the third example of a compensatory spiritual blessing for the righteous. The words of the Lord's prophet, the First Presidency, and the Quorum of the Twelve are always available to lighten our path and help show us the way. Their united voice, if followed, will help set aside the enticing voices of the world. The men who occupy these positions would claim no personal perfection, but I witness to you that as the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve prayerfully approach the Lord, He shapes our thinking and direction and reveals His will for His covenant people, and indeed for all the world.<br><br>In recent months the First Presidency and the Twelve have felt an undeniable direction from the Lord to declare and reemphasize the Sabbath day and the importance of worthily partaking of the sacrament. As we take the sacrament, we remember the Savior and His Atonement. We come repenting of our sins, pledging our loyalty to covenants made with Him, and hearing again the promises He makes to us. To always have His Spirit with us is a pearl of enormous value. Receiving the sacrament on Sunday is more and more like an oasis in the desert--bubbling with cool spring water, quenching our spiritual thirst and relieving our parched souls.<br><br>President Russell M. Nelson's April general conference talk was titled "The Sabbath Is a Delight." President Nelson explained how he approached the Sabbath:<br><br><i>In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things <b>not</b> to do on the Sabbath. It wasn't until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a <b>sign</b> between me and my Heavenly Father (see Exodus 31:13; Ezekiel 20:12, 20). With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don'ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, Isimply asked myself, "What <b>sign</b> do I want to give to God?" That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>In our day the Lord has promised that honoring the Sabbath will help us in keeping ourselves "unspotted from the world."<sup>25</sup><br><br>Can you see the Lord's hand in giving us the technology to turn our children toward their fathers? Can you see why the Lord would greatly increase the temples upon the earth? Can you see the Lord's purposes in helping us to more fully honor the Sabbath day? These are compensatory spiritual gifts from heaven for the righteous. And there are many, many more. As we recognize and embrace them, they heighten our spiritual sensitivities, offering greater assurance and confidence. The precious gift of the Holy Ghost becomes a stronger beacon, and we more clearly see those things that are unseen.<br><br>This added spiritual power does not just fall upon us. It comes as we act. The scriptures tell us that "Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord,"<sup>26</sup> but he and his family still needed to build and enter the ark.<br><br>God prepared the means for the children of Israel to be healed from the fiery flying serpents, but He still required that they look upon the serpent of brass attached to Moses' staff.<sup>27</sup><br><br>The Saints sang in our dispensation, "We'll find the place which God for us prepared,"<sup>28</sup> but they still had to pick up their handcarts and go west.<br><br>Let me return to the beautiful quote by Brother Heber C. Kimball:<br><br><i>To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves. The difficulties will be of such a character that the man or woman who does not possess this personal knowledge or witness will fall. ...</i><br><br><i>... The time will come when no man nor woman will be able to endure on borrowed light.</i><sup>29</sup><br><br>I like to think of it this way: If two people are walking together along a very gentle terrain, one lantern is often sufficient. But when the time comes, as it does with each child, that he or she steps away from us to take his or her own journey, our light is no longer sufficient to light his or her way. And while one may be linked tightly to a companion--if you are fortunate enough to have a companion of faith--if we unexpectedly face jagged rocks and uneven cliffs, each needs his or her own lantern to light the path.<br><br>In this month's First Presidency message, President Monson said:<br><br><i>We must develop the faith necessary to survive spiritually and to project a light for others. We must nurture our testimony until it becomes an anchor to our lives.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>I pray that your faith in Him will always be an anchor to your souls. I give you my sure witness that Jesus is the Christ. He is resurrected. He lives and He guides His holy work upon the earth. As you look to the Lord Jesus Christ in all you do, may your faithfulness, Ipray, bless those you love as they also seek to follow the Savior and follow in your path. Ipromise you that as you embrace the spiritual gifts prepared for the righteous, He will steady you, strengthen you, shape you, and secure you. You will be His. I so witness, in His holy name, the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil L.

<h1>t for Perfection and Eternal Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I wish to begin my remarks today with an expression of gratitude to the academic administrators on campus. This year the deans of three of our academic colleges completed their service in the office, and their replacements were appointed following a thorough search process. Associate deans have been invited to serve with these new deans in the college leadership. In addition, twelve department chairs completed their terms this year and, following careful consideration and upon recommendation of their deans, new chairs were appointed this summer. This constitutes a significant fraction of the academic leadership on campus.<br><br>As you know, BYU has a rather unique model of rotating academic leadership. At universities elsewhere, appointment as department chair or college dean is usually a career move, and the candidate who seeks the position generally abandons the traditional faculty life of teaching and research. By contrast, at BYU, academic administrators serve for a season (although at times it may seem to them like an eternity). They make difficult decisions they will live with after their administrative appointment ends and they again take an office next to their faculty colleagues inthe department.<br><br>This model means we are continually training new administrators. Their appointments come with high expectations and little personal tangible benefit. We have no executive salary structure at BYU. Deans and chairs agree to serve--generally without aspiring to the position and most often with hesitation to take on the assignment--motivated by love and loyalty for the university and its mission, their college, their faculty colleagues, and most important, the students. These administrators set a tone for the student experience through direct influence on academic programs; expanding student opportunities; faculty hiring, development, retention, and promotion; and resource distribution--and, it must be candidly acknowledged, more than a little conflict resolution. And despite knowing the enormity of the task, our colleagues accept the invitation to serve anyway.<br><br>In April of this year we honored at a retirement dinner forty-one of our faculty colleagues who had completed their professional service here. Remarkably, half of them had served as academic administrators during their BYU career.<br><br>Every seven years our academic and academic support units are reviewed as part of our university assessment process. Two faculty of stature from universities elsewhere are invited to participate in the review of every academic department, reading the self-study and investigating the department's operation in a campus visit. The two external reviewers begin their campus visit with a meeting in my office, where I have the opportunity to acquaint them with BYU and its mission, resource base, governance, and constraints. The external reviewers are astonished when I describe the university's model of rotating academic leadership. In multiple such meetings external reviewers have asked me, "With so little benefit to them personally and professionally, how do you get faculty to serve in these leadership positions?" It is difficult for them to understand when I smile and tell them that BYU faculty are uniformly committed to what we are trying to accomplish here and accept leadership responsibilities out of a deep sense of loyalty to the university. So as I begin my remarks today, I want to publicly and energetically express our thanks for the usually thankless work of the deans, associate deans, and department chairs--those who are now serving and those who have unselfishly served in the past.<br><h2><b>Staying on Course</b></h2><br>Recently I read the interesting history of the life and accomplishments of Florence May Chadwick. Florence was born in 1918, grew up in San Diego, California, and at an early age developed a passion for swimming--long-distance swimming. At age ten she took fourth place in a two-and-a-half-mile "rough water" ocean swim. The next year she won first in a six-mile rough water swim across the San Diego Bay channel. For the next nineteen years she continued as a competitive long-distance swimmer.<br><br>In August 1950, at the age of thirty-one, Florence swam the English Channel from France to England, a distance of about twenty-three miles, in thirteen hours and twenty minutes, breaking the world record set twenty-four years earlier by American swimmer and Olympic champion Gertrude Ederle. One year later Florence swam the reverse route from England to France--reportedly much more difficult because of challenging tides and currents--in sixteen hours and twenty-two minutes, making her the first woman to swim the English Channel in both directions.<br><br>On July 4, 1952, at the age of thirty-three, Florence Chadwick set out to be the first woman to swim the twenty-one miles between Catalina Island and Palos Verde on the California coast. The water was cold, and ocean predators circled around her repeatedly. Several times her support crew had to use rifles to scare off the sharks. Over the course of the swim a thick fog set in, making it difficult to see. Despite encouragement from her mother and her trainer, who were in one of the support boats, after fifteen hours and fifty-five minutes (approximately sixty thousand strokes into the crossing), Florence felt she couldn't go on and asked to be taken out of the water.<br><br>As it turned out, she was only half a mile from land. She told a reporter, "Look, I'm not excusing myself, but if I could have seen land, Iknow I could have made it."<sup>1</sup> Two months later she tried again. The fog was very dense, but this time she made it, in thirteen hours and forty-seven minutes, breaking the twenty-seven-year-old record by more than two hours. She was the first woman ever to complete the swim. She reportedly stated that she was successful the second time because while she swam, she kept in her mind a mental image of the shoreline.<sup>2</sup><br><br>This inspiring account underlines the importance of keeping one's mind on the goal in any endeavor. To quote that wisest of sages, Yogi Berra, "If you don't know where you are going, you might end up someplace else."<br><br>In the past year President Kevin J Worthen has repeatedly reminded us of our goal:<br><br><i>The mission of Brigham Young University--founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--is to assist ­individuals in their quest for perfection and eternallife.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/merrill-j-bateman_mission-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a><br><br>President Worthen's reminders have been invigorating to me and serve to keep us all from getting lost in the fog. The BYU mission statement is what fundamentally distinguishes BYU, at the very least in principle, from very fine universities elsewhere. Our stated mission is ambitious--even audacious. How can a bunch of faculty trained traditionally in physics, dance, biology, and comparative literature assist others at the university in their quest for perfection and eternal life? And a related question is <i>why?</i> At the beginning of each new school year it has been my practice to read some of the foundation documents of Brigham Young University--President JeffreyR. Holland's "A School in Zion," President J.Reuben Clark Jr.'s "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," President Spencer W. Kimball's "Education for Eternity" and "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," and Elder Neal A. Maxwell's "Discipleship and Scholarship," to name a few. All have written powerfully about the central place of learning and particularly about <i>this</i> place of learning in the kingdom.<br><br>President Worthen recently responded to a question regarding the challenges Brigham Young University faces in maintaining its unique focus. He listed two. The first challenge is outside regulation that may make it difficult to achieve our mission. The second is what he called the challenge of Doctrine and Covenants 121:35. Let me share his words:<br><br><i>Verse 34 says, </i><i>"</i><i>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?" The first part of verse 35 answers that question: </i><i>"</i><i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men." In the academy in particular, there will always be a pull for us to become like others. The prestige lies in doing research that may not be exactly the way we would do it if there were not outside peer pressure. There is pressure to emphasize research more than teaching, to ignore undergraduates. One of the things we need to be constantly concerned about is that our hearts don't get set so much on the things of this world and aspire to the honors of men that we start to drift internally.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>It is the constant reminder of our mission that will help keep us on course despite the fog. Without this careful mapping of our course, we may find ourselves swimming in circles, so to speak, in the day-to-day responsibilities of faculty life at BYU. Indeed, even extraordinary accomplishment against traditional measures of academic success--­analogous to swimming at a world-record pace--will do us little good if we arrive at the wrong finish line.<br><h2><b>Learning to Learn</b></h2><br>The major educational goals articulated in our mission statement aspire to (1) the teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, (2) pursuit of a broad university education, (3) instruction in the special fields of the various disciplines across campus, and (4) scholarly research and creative work.<sup>5</sup> Clear in these objectives is that <i>learning</i> is central to BYU's reason for being. It would seem, therefore, that learning to learn is vital.<br><br>It is about several dimensions of this important charge that I wish to speak today. Learning to learn is important not only for our students--over thirty thousand of whom will arrive next week--but for us. President Worthen has reminded us that the mission of the university is to assist <i>individuals</i> in their quest for perfection--not just students, not just visitors to campus, but faculty and staff and administrative colleagues as well. Indeed, it would seem a bit hypocritical for us to embrace the mission with <i>only</i> our students in mind, neglecting our own quest along the way. We, too, must learn and grow and progress.<br><br>Even respected colleagues outside our community who are not familiar with Brigham Young University's aspirational mission assert that the bar should be set higher in the delivery of higher education. William Deresiewicz, former university professor at an Ivy League school and now an author, has advocated for a broader university education that has a ring of "the balanced development of the total person"<sup>6</sup> from our mission statement that is at the core of our work at BYU. Deresiewicz wrote:<br><br><i>The purpose of college ... is to turn adolescents into adults. You needn't go to school for that, but if you're going to be there anyway, then that's the most important thing to get accomplished. That is the true education: accept no substitutes. The idea that we should take the first four years of young adulthood and devote them to career preparation alone, neglecting every other part of life, is nothing short of an obscenity. If that's what people had you do, then you were robbed.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>It is both our charge and our opportunity to teach and to model for our students the divine linkage between learning and perfection and to do it in an environment of faith.<br><h2><b>Learning Through Trial and Error</b></h2><br>New students who come to BYU are among the best in the nation. Indeed, there is nothing average about the average freshman at BYU. With application records that show dizzying schedules, these students have studied, performed on the field and on the stage, worked, and served at levels that are intimidating to those of us who came to the university as students decades ago. But in this BYU environment they will face rigor and challenge unlike what they have navigated before, and it will demand more independence than ever before in their lives. Now contact with Mom will be reduced to a daily cell phone call (or two or three) and Dad will not be there to put a foot down if needed. Gone are the days of forgiving high school teachers. Students will face less memorization and more demand for critical thinking, and they will have to adjust to fewer sliding deadlines. It is both our charge and our challenge to help them <i>learn to learn.</i> For many, BYU will introduce them to their first serious failure, and it may be unsettling. We must help them understand that there is little real growth without stretching and stumbling.<br><br>President Worthen counseled the students in his devotional address in January of this year that they should learn to fail successfully. Are we prepared to model this in our own professional lives? Unfortunately, most of us, students and faculty alike, seek to insulate ourselves from failure. The thought of trying something unfamiliar without the certainty of succeeding is often paralyzing. If we are to learn to learn, and teach our students the same, we must be prepared to risk a venture that may not succeed.<br><br>Perhaps more than success, what we should be cultivating is resilience. In her research to write <i>The Rise: Creativity, the Gift of Failure, and the Search for Mastery,</i> Sarah Lewis interviewed more than 150 professionals in diverse fields who had faced major setbacks. She observed that individuals who have reached a level of professional stature and had a failure hit them would never call the experience a failure. The term <i>failure,</i> she points out, does not capture the rebounding energy that can come afterward. She concludes in her work that the opposite of failure is not <i>success,</i> which is a word that captures a moment in time. Rather, the opposite of failure is <i>mastery,</i> which describes acontinuous process.<sup>8</sup><br><br>There is something reminiscent of the plan of salvation in her observations. We grow through trial and error, and in this environment the students learn what might be termed "academic repentance." Fearing failure, how many students avoid taking a challenging class that might stretch them because it could hurt their GPA? As faculty we wisely caution them relative to this restrictive thinking but then hesitate to submit our fine scholarly work to a more prestigious journal because we fear what the reviews might be.<br><br>Two weeks ago I enjoyed a delightful visit in my office with a former student and his family--one of several visits in the years since he graduated. This student's name is Alberto Serrano, and I share his story with his permission. This student enrolled in an introductory thermodynamics course I taught thirteen years ago--fall semester 2002. At that time students in the civil engineering program enrolled in the thermodynamics course in the Mechanical Engineering Department as part of their required curriculum. To be quite candid, the civil engineering students had little interest in the course. It was outside their discipline, with little relevance to their focus. While the course was taken at the sophomore level by mechanical engineering students, civil engineering students often left it to their last year to satisfy this requirement. The course is challenging and cumulative, and students who struggle in the beginning often have difficulty all the way through. Like so many of my colleagues on the faculty, I have high expectations for students, and I structure the course so that students take weekly quizzes, complete weekly homework assignments, and take three midterm examinations plus a comprehensive final exam.<br><br>It is with this background as context for the course that I describe Alberto Serrano. Alberto enrolled in the thermodynamics class as a civil engineering senior--in the last year of his undergraduate program. He had done very well in his prior course work. He and his fellow civil engineering students sat on the back row, it seemed, daring me to try to interest them in thermodynamics. Alberto did poorly on the first exam, well below the class average and likely a failing grade. My teaching experience has exposed me to students in this situation who complain, retreat, and surrender for the remainder of the course after such a failure. Alberto came to my office after the first exam and asked how he could better prepare. He did not blame me or the exam, as students are sometimes prone to do. Rather, he took personal responsibility for his own misstep and determined to turn negative to positive.<br><br>Like other students who ask how they can improve when they find themselves in the same situation, I made a challenging and demanding suggestion of Alberto. Typically an engineering textbook has dozens of problems at the end of each chapter, and the instructor chooses a small subset of problems to assign as weekly homework to the class. This has been my practice. I told Alberto that if, in addition to the assigned homework, he would work as many of the <i>unassigned</i> problems at the end of each chapter in the textbook as he could, I would help him with questions that arose. I told him that while I would not award him extra credit for the unassigned problems he completed, I was confident his understanding of the material and exam scores would improve.<br><br>I have made this offer many times to students with few committed takers, so I was not hopeful Alberto would respond. But he did. Right away I began to see Alberto regularly and frequently in my office--multiple times a week. And he came in with sheaves of homework paper. In those visits he first asked questions about the problems assigned as homework and then would move on to the unassigned problems he was working on. He wouldn't leave my office until all of his questions were answered. He became more engaged in class, asking deeper questions that went beyond the often-asked "Will this be on the exam?"<br><br>It is my recollection that Alberto completed every homework problem in every chapter of the text we covered in class. On the second midterm exam Alberto scored well above the class average. On the third midterm his score was the highest in the class. He ended the semester with a perfect score on the weekly quizzes and a near-perfect score on the assigned homework. Whereas Alberto was on track early in the semester to finish the course with a failing or D grade, he ended the semester with an A−. He <i>earned</i> this final grade in every noble sense of the word. Never prior to my experience with Alberto, and never since that semester, have I had a student so diligent and so committed to independent learning--toturning failure into mastery.<br><br>Since his graduation, Alberto has invited me to provide letters of recommendation as he has pursued employment opportunities. As you might guess, writing a sterling recommendation for him has come easily to me. His professional accomplishments since he left BYU are reflective of the approach to failure he cultivated as a student.<br><br>President Worthen's counsel to students applies both to them and to us:<br><br><i>We will all fail. More than once. Every day.</i> ...<br><br><i>My plea for you today is to learn how to fail successfully.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-j-worthen_successfully-failing-pursuing-quest-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>9</sup></a><br><h2><b>Learning Through Correction</b></h2><br>Another significant and central dimension to learning to learn is being open to critical feedback and being willing to act on it. Unfortunately it is human nature to take correction so personally as to view it a threat. Defending our position may be warranted, but to dismiss constructive feedback is to pass up an opportunity for improvement. In our faculty role, providing correction seems to come quite naturally, but inviting constructive feedback on our own work is so very intimidating. And we tend to dismiss feedback that originates with those we view as less capable, less experienced, or of lesser stature or position. Ihave been impressed with more than one dean who regularly asks what they can dobetter.<br><br>Late in 1823, a few months shy of his eighteenth birthday (the age of our matriculating freshmen, I might add), Joseph Smith was feeling anxious about lapses in his teenage judgment and his weaknesses and mistakes ("follies," in his words). He went to the Lord inprayer. Verse 29 of his history reads:<br><br><i>In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the ... twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>I am struck with the thought that this ­seventeen-year-old prophet-to-be was in a state of acknowledging his weaknesses and was seeking critical feedback when he approached heaven that night. What came of his inviting feedback? It was on this night and the following morning that Joseph entertained the angel Moroni four times, that he was perhaps first introduced to his prophetic charge, that he was first instructed in any detail relative to the Restoration, that the first intimation of priesthood authority and keys came, and that the existence of the Book of Mormon was first made known to him. While Joseph's prayer in the Sacred Grove was and is a singular event in the world's history, it might be argued that it was his solicitation of heaven's corrective feedback that September night three and a half years after the First Vision that triggered the detailed sequence of events in the Restoration. Inviting correction brings blessings--often profound blessings--to those willing to listen. These words from Proverbs hold a powerful promise and seem to­underline the important role of correction in learning to learn:<br><br><i>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Interestingly, in the thirty-one chapters of Proverbs there are more than a dozen admonitions for us to welcome reproof--and a few rather stern warnings to those who bristle under such correction. After all, in the spirit of learning to fail successfully, might not <i>reprove</i> be easily translated as <i>re-prove,</i> implying another chance after correction?<br><br>Let me give a word to department chairs, faculty stewardship committees, and new ­faculty mentors in this regard: Constructive yet compassionate feedback is necessary to faculty growth and is particularly crucial in the early years of a new faculty member's appointment. "Reproving betimes with sharpness"<sup>12</sup> can mean a gentle but candid conversation relative to teaching, scholarly productivity, collegiality, etc. I am not talking about ascolding, although I must admit Ihave needed a "professional spanking" from time to time. Nor am I suggesting that criticism replace well-deserved praise. There are few things that cause me to try harder than to have someone elevate me with praise far above what I deserve. What I am suggesting is that progress is possible only where specific areas for improvement are noted. Criticism is best served with kindness. And to all of us faculty who receive critical feedback, let us remember past successes. We have all experienced a brutal peer review of our scholarly work, siphoning the excitement and confidence out of us. After a few days we pick ourselves up off the floor, drag ourselves back to the manuscript, and go to work on a revision. Invariably the revision is stronger. We ask no less than this of our students when faced with critique. They deserve no less from us, who are charged with assisting in the quest forperfection.<br><br>Our primary responsibility at the university is the learning of our students. That learning takes place in the classroom, the laboratory, the field, the clinic, the studio, and the office--even the Testing Center. Given the vital role of teaching at BYU in this, our primary charge, it seems acutely important that we seek to assess confidently our effectiveness in this area of stewardship--that we welcome feedback from the students we are seeking to influence. Now, I understand that there are few faculty issues that produce more emotion and debate than student ratings. However, in the spirit of inviting corrective feedback, which we seek to cultivate in our students, let me suggest that student ratings are the students' chance to help us in this our most significant BYU stewardship.<br><br>The current student-ratings tool has been used since fall semester 2001. The instrument has twenty-three questions, including two questions related to overall rating of both teacher and course. A single question invites student narrative comments. The current tool has served us well, but over the course of time we have identified deficiencies in the instrument and in the way results have been interpreted. Of particular concern has been our inability to define the bounds in accuracy of the student ratings.<br><br>Six years ago my predecessor, John S. Tanner, empaneled a large group of faculty from diverse disciplines across campus to investigate these deficiencies and propose a new ratings tool. Our colleagues on the Student Ratings Task Force have worked long and hard on this assignment, asking fundamental questions about what to measure, whether it can be measured, how to measure it, how confident of the measurements we can be, and a host of other relevant issues. After thorough study and consideration of the related academic literature, they determined that a new instrument would need to feature fewer questions and provide greater opportunity for student comment. They concluded, further, that a new survey should focus more pointedly on teaching effectiveness and the achievement of the BYU Aims.<br><br>My impression is that the Task Force's work has been something of a constitutional-­convention experience--conflict and ­compromise--except that their labor of love has gone on for considerably longer than the convention delegates' blistering summer of 1787. The group has debated the philosophy ofstudent ratings, studied thoroughly the current instrument and ratings histories, scoured the academic literature on student ratings, considered and reconsidered new ratings questions, debated some more, run pilot evaluations in their own classes, investigated the characterization of statistical accuracy of ratings, and debated again. The Task Force first presented its findings and proposed a draft survey tool to the Academic Vice President's Council in April 2014. Over the course of several long meetings, we engaged in some refinements to their draft instrument. The Task Force's work at that point was presented to the deans and to the Faculty Advisory Council. Thereafter a small-scale pilot in about twenty classes, using the proposed ­survey tool, was approved.<br><br>With encouraging results from this pilot, and after further refinements, a broad campus experiment with the new ratings tool was approved for winter semester of this year. While the opportunity to opt-out of participation in the pilot was offered, the vast majority of you used the new tool in your classes. Iexpress gratitude to you for your willingness to engage in the experience. The winter semester pilot included 4,875 sections from 2,141 courses and 2,059 instructors, with more than 85,000 student ratings completed. Roughly 13percent of the courses surveyed were at the graduate level, with the remainder equally divided between lower- and upper-division undergraduate courses. More than 70­percent of the students responded, up from our ­historical average of about 65 percent using the­current ratings instrument.<br><br>Based on the pilot results, the Task Force has concluded that we can assess the student experience and that we can accurately aggregate the questions related to teacher effectiveness and confidently evaluate the students' perception of their achievement of the BYU Aims. The new ratings instrument has only nine questions, with extensive student commentary invited. Further, and perhaps most significantly, for the first time we feel able to identify the statistical error bound in the aggregate ratings, equipping us to avoid inappropriate interpretation of the evaluation data. The ratings instrument and pilot data will be presented to all department chairs early in September, with a similar presentation to the Faculty Advisory Council as soon as we can get on their schedule. With the advantages offered by the new instrument and analysis of the ratings data, it is our hope that we will be in a position to adopt it campus­wide this semester.<br><br>I recognize that this new student ratings instrument is unlikely to answer all questions about student evaluations. However, it is my hope that we can acknowledge the utility of inviting feedback from our students and that we can recognize the potential for improvement that will come as we respond to that feedback. We are positioned to do this with a faculty-designed instrument whose results we can consider with confidence. I acknowledge with deep gratitude the thoughtful, careful, collaborative, and sometimes painful but always patient work of our colleagues on the Student Ratings Task Force.<br><br>In our quest for perfection and eternal life, may the BYU community view corrective feedback as the pathway to improvement that it is intended to be, and may we offer feedback both to students and to our colleagues in that spirit. Let me quote again from Proverbs:<br><br><i>Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.</i><sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Learning Through Scholarship</b></h2><br>If we are to assist students in their quest to learn to learn, we faculty must walk the walk. Our mission statement declares:<br><br><i>Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and will be encouraged.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>This board-approved declaration emphatically illustrates that faculty learning is a central--essential--part of our work at the university. One might ask, "Why is faculty scholarship so important when the portion of our time spent on scholarly activities could be directed to teaching more students, especially in a time of growing stress on admissions at BYU?" The Lord has made it clear that cultivation of active, thinking, engaged minds is an indispensable part of the quest for perfection. Consider the following revelatory pronouncements:<br><ul><br> 	<li>"Behold, the Lord requireth the heart anda willing mind."<sup>15</sup></li><br> 	<li>"Teach ye diligently ... things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass ... ; and a knowledge also ofcountries and kingdoms."<sup>16</sup></li><br> 	<li>"It is impossible for a man to be saved inignorance."<sup>17</sup></li><br> 	<li>"The glory of God is intelligence."<sup>18</sup></li><br></ul><br>I could go on and on citing relevant prophetic references. No doubt our scholarly activity contributes to the body of knowledge in our disciplines. I don't want to be profane, but it would seem that for us there is a deeper--an eternal--consequence to our journal manuscripts and our juried artwork. There seems to be an unmistakable connection between the learning process and the quest for perfection and eternal life. We mustbe scholars willing to invest in the hard work of learning and professing what we learn in our own academic lives. And we must do it "even by study and also by faith."<sup>19</sup> Who better and where better to model for ­students and others how this is done than byus atBYU?<br><br>Such passion about learning leads to our developing the same appetite we hope for inour students. We come to view our university service as so much more than work. A noted author described it this way: "The more I want to get something done, the less I call it work."<sup>20</sup> I am quick to confess that scholarship <i>is</i> work--hard work. Nothing associated with the reach for excellence has ever been easy.<br><br>I am reminded of a joke I heard long ago.<br><br>An angel appeared at a faculty meeting and told a senior, respected, and accomplished academic that in return for his unselfish and exemplary behavior, heaven would reward him with his choice of infinite wealth, unlimited knowledge, or unspeakable beauty. Without hesitating, the wise faculty member selected unlimited knowledge.<br><br>"Done!" said the angel, and he disappeared in a cloud of smoke and a bolt of lightning.<br><br>Now all heads turned toward their esteemed colleague, who sat surrounded byafaint halo of light.<br><br>After a long silence, one in the group ­whispered, "Say something."<br><br>Their senior colleague sighed and said, "Ishould have taken the money."<br><br>There is no shortcut to learning, and ­knowledge alone can be empty.<br><br>Brigham Young stated:<br><br><i>And when we have lived millions of years in the presence of God and angels ... , shall we then cease learning? No, or eternity ceases.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>An interesting recent academic publication is relevant here. The paper detailed a psychological study revealing that the more people think they know about a topic, the more likely they are to allege understanding beyond what they know, even to the point of feigning knowledge of false facts and fabricated information. This phenomenon is termed "overclaiming," and it appears those individuals who believe they already have a high level of knowledge in a particular area are especially vulnerable. The authors of the study warn that<br><br><i>a tendency to overclaim, especially in self-perceived experts, could have adverse consequences</i> [and] <i>may discourage individuals from educating themselves in precisely those areas in which they consider themselves knowledgeable.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Being the expert on a subject can be exhilarating, with students and colleagues hanging on our every word. However, without a deep commitment to continued learning, we will fall victim to overclaiming, and no one likes a "know-it-all."<br><h2><b>Learning Through Love</b></h2><br>Now let me share a thought that has persisted in my mind for some time. Brigham Young University is a concentrated community of consecrated Latter-day Saints. But we are all humans, with human failings and human trials. The mission statement gives us guidance:<br><br><i>Certainly all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Our achievement of academic distinction must not come at the expense of civility, collegiality, or collaboration. Unlike the stark reputation of the cutthroat academy, at BYU we know that knowledge and fundamental Christian goodness are complimentary virtues. Our institutional ranking and individual faculty recognition will rise no higher than the simple way we treat each other. Even with ­cutting-edge curriculum and world-class research and creative work, "if ye have not charity, ye are nothing."<sup>24</sup> Empathy and excellence are not mutually exclusive, and bearing one another's burdens is a covenant charge that makes no distinction between family, neighbors, colleagues, staff, or students. I have been impressed with colleagues across campus who have achieved international stature and whose interactions with others exhibit their love of God. At BYU, if we are to achieve our mission, we cannot be casual about how we learn or how we live. This should be our goal: education of the whole person, taught by­precept and example.<br><h2><b>"A World We Wish to Improve"</b></h2><br>Brigham Young University is a unique place. You are a unique faculty. Our students are a unique population. The influence of BYU is difficult to measure, but once in a while an experience gives a glimpse of that influence. Iconclude today with one such experience.<br><br>A colleague told me of a recent visit to ­campus by a faculty member of stature from avery fine East Coast university, where he has taught for more than twenty years. The visitor, not of our faith, came to BYU, presented a department lecture, toured the facilities, visited with a handful of faculty who shared his research interests, and interacted with students. At the conclusion of his visit he graciously expressed a positive view of the university and left for home.<br><br>Months later the visitor called his BYU host out of the blue and stated that during his visit he had been impressed with the collegiality of the faculty, the depth of questions asked by students, the department's vision, the university's commitment to undergraduate education, and the quality of both faculty and students. He shared that, during his visit to campus, he had felt something that he couldn't really describe, but in the months that followed that feeling had caused him to think many times about the department and university. Those feelings led him several times to the BYU website, where he navigated to multiple documents detailing our unique identity and focus. He reported having read in its entirety the Academic Freedom Policy and said it was the most coherent and well-thought-out policy he had ever seen. He read the BYU mission statement and The Aims of a BYU Education document and remarked how impressed he was with both documents and the commitment of the university to a balanced focus on spiritual development and traditional academics. He then asked how the department might respond to an application from him for its next faculty position vacancy.<br><br>The final sentence in the mission statement declares:<br><br><i>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Thank you for being a central part of that influence.<br><br>I am grateful to be a faculty member at BYU. I am grateful for the university's ambitious mission and to be engaged with you in seeking to achieve it. Finally, I am grateful for my association with you across campus. May we have a productive year--a year of success and influence elevated and shaped by BYU's unique mission to "assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." May our firm embrace of the mission clear the fog that could cause us to drift from the influence prophets have envisioned.<br><br><i>Brent W.

<h1>t and Determined Community of Learners and Lifters - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to see you all here this ­morning and to feel the joy, warmth, and enthusiasm you radiate. I count it as one of the great blessings of my life that I have the opportunity to associate daily with such ­talented, consecrated people whose main focus is to provide our students with the kind of holistic learning experience that President SpencerW. Kimball called "education for eternity."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_education-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a> I am grateful beyond words to each of you for your efforts in that remarkable and remarkably rewarding enterprise.<br><br>I don't think that anyone who has heard me speak this last year will be surprised that this year's annual university conference theme--"Assist Individuals in Their Quest for Perfection and Eternal Life"--is a line from our mission statement.<sup>2</sup> That deeply rich foundational document was the central focus of my remarks at this conference last year, and I have tried to mention it (if not make it the main theme) in the many speaking opportunities I have had since then. Given that effort, Icouldn't help but occasionally wonder if my almost obsessive emphasis on the mission statement was having any impact. Was anyone listening? Did anyone care?<br><br>Such inquiries usually end up being ­rhetorical. But on occasion, heaven provides small but encouraging indications that the message is getting through--though sometimes in the most unexpected ways and in the most unanticipated places. I suppose many of you have already seen this clip from a tele­vision show last month, but because it gives me a little boost every time I see it, I hope you don't mind indulging me in showing one more time the segment of <i>Jeopardy!</i> that aired on July23, 2015.<sup>3</sup> [The video clip was shown.]<br><br>Who knew that attendance at last year's annual university conference would be ­preparation for a final <i>Jeopardy!</i> question? Given the answers of the first two contestants, maybe I should have given some emphasis to spelling and considered adding a veterinarian program to the university. In any event, Iappreciate the publicity that the show gave to what is our unique mission to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.<br><br>In this last year we have seen some of the fruits of our long-term efforts to achieve that and the other goals set forth in the mission statement. Those who arrived early at this session may have seen several examples in the pre-conference presentation on the beautiful new video display boards overhead. In fact, the video display boards themselves are partial fulfillment of one aspect of our mission. The mission statement challenges us to provide "astimulating setting" in which our students can pursue "the full realization of human potential."<sup>4</sup> The display boards will certainly make it easier for those who attend events here to be more fully immersed in and uplifted by the many different kinds of activities that occur here, from concerts to basketball games to performances and devotionals. All will be more stimulating, thanks to the efforts of those who made the acquisition and installation of the video boards possible.<br><br>Let me also note the new seats in which you are seated. There is no explicit reference to comfort in the mission statement, but surely the kind of learning that we hope occurs in this building will be enhanced by the fact that those who attend can focus on the words of the speakers or the skill of the performers and not on avoiding the embarrassment that comes from placing your knees into the back of the person in front of you or worrying about whether you will need to schedule a visit to your chiropractor because of the contortions required to fit into the allotted space. I extend my personal appreciation to Physical Facilities, OIT, Special Events, and all the other organizations that in a very short window between Women's Conference and August commencement provided an extreme makeover and greatly extended the life of this most important gathering place on our campus. It was truly a heroic effort by so many.<br><br>Equally impressive and equally impactful were the efforts of our physical facilities and grounds crew personnel to complete the second phase of our Campus Drive redesign, rendering the campus more beautiful, more pedestrian friendly, and overall more conducive to the kind of life-changing experience we hope our students have here. I also express appreciation to all of you who soldiered on through the construction delays and detours during the summer. We know it was disruptive, but the end result is an enhancement of the stimulating setting in which our students will carry on this phase of their quest for perfection and eternal life.<br><br>Our mission statement also commits us to preparing our students in such a way and to such a degree that they are "capable of competing with the best in their fields."<sup>5</sup> There was ample evidence this past year that this is occurring on campus in a wide variety of ways.<br><br>For example, performers from BYU's Theatreand Media Arts Department won more than fifteen awards at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival--eleven of which recognized students participating in <i>Our Town,</i> a reinvention of the American ­classic by the students who incorporated film into the live play.<br><br>A team of BYU accounting students earned first place at the national Deloitte FanTAXtic case study competition, where teams from more than 100 universities were asked to review the situation of a hypothetical company and recommend solutions based on their knowledge of tax law and practices. This is the ninth time in the past fourteen years that BYU has brought home the top prize.<br><br>The women's volleyball team played in the national championship game, upsetting higher-ranked Arizona, Florida State, and Texas along the way and becoming the first unseeded tournament team ever to reach the national championship game.<br><br>And four BYU broadcast journalism ­students won Gracie Awards, national honors given by the Alliance for Women in Media to recognize the accomplishments of women in media and entertainment at the local, public, and student levels.<br><br>There are numerous other examples. I don't have time to mention them all, but I invite you to take note of and celebrate these kinds of successes in your individual colleges and departments. In our journey up the mountain, we need to pause from time to time to enjoy the view that we have gained as a result of our combined efforts.<br><br>In short, we have accomplished a lot this year. And as a result of the hard work and dedication of so many--not just this past year but for many decades--we are part of an extraordinary university with a strong foundation. That fact is recognized by others who come here. You all know that representatives of the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, our main accreditation body, visited campus this past April. I am happy to report that the visit went well and that we have recently been informed that our accreditation has been reaffirmed. I express my appreciation to so many--especially Jim Gordon and his team--who worked so hard to achieve thisresult.<br><br>I could go on and on, but let me conclude this brief report on where we are and what we have accomplished by sharing with you the just-completed video produced by Julie Walker and her team in University Communications to introduce BYU to prospective students.<sup>6</sup> It provides a general overview of what this university has become over the years and demonstrates that, as we look toward the future, we are built upon a very strong foundation. [The video was shown.]<br><br>It is clear that we are in a good place. But we cannot stop now. As President Kimball reminded us during his address "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," there are still hills ahead of us and mountains left to climb.<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a> We have a remarkable history, and we are extraordinarily situated at the present. But what about the future? What can we do this year to better assist individuals in their quest for perfection? Where do we go from here? Those who attended my inauguration and have noted the references to mountains, hills, and climbing in my remarks so far today are probably expecting at this point to hear the refrains from the closing number of <i>The Sound of Music</i> and a call for us to "go to the mountains."<br><br>I love that allusion and will return to it throughout my administration, but today Iwant to focus on particular aspects of that ascent that come from a complementary theme sounded in another address in that inauguration ceremony. While you may--or may not--have listened intently to my remarks last September, I paid most attention to the address given by President Henry B. Eyring. And I had a particular reason for doing so.<br><br>When the invitation to accept my current position came to me from the First Presidency early in 2014, I did not receive much by way of instruction--or at least I do not remember receiving much. I must confess that I experienced a bit of shock when the invitation came, so when I left the Church Administration Building that morning, I could not recall any particular charge or instruction about the course of the university or the focus I should have. It was not a particularly comforting feeling. Therefore I paid particular attention towhat President Eyring said during the inauguration last September, hoping to find some direction in his remarks. And, as is usually the case when we concentrate on the words of prophets, I was amply rewarded, both in the moment of delivery and during subsequent reviews of his remarks.<br><br>What initially stood out to me was President Eyring's statement that the course of this university had been set by its founder, Brigham Young, in a one-sentence declaration. Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>Put forth your ability to learn as fast as you can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith you possibly can, and then distribute your knowledge to the people.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_leader-learners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>8</sup></a><br><br>Embedded in that profound sentence are three important insights. First, those of us at this university have an obligation to learn as fast as we can. Second, this kind of learning requires all the strength of both our minds and our faith. And third, our responsibility does not end when we have acquired all the knowledge that results from that kind of effort; we are required to distribute that knowledge to others--or, as President Eyring phrased it later in his remarks:<br><br><i>The vision at the founding was that all here will seek truth not for themselves alone but will also distribute what they have learned to bless others.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Summarizing this view, President Eyring suggested that we have built and should continue to build on what he called this "shared vision of learning, teaching, and serving that has shaped this university."<br><br>Now, some may think that this emphasis on learning, teaching, and serving applies only to the core academic enterprise and that President Eyring's charge was aimed only at the faculty. It is true that this vision requires faculty who are continually learning, both in their particular substantive areas and in the common enterprise of teaching in which all faculty are involved. It is also true that the insights faculty gain in that endeavor are to be shared both with the students they teach and with others outside the university, including not only their peers in their disciplines but also others in the world at large. However, President Eyring made clear that this one-sentence charge from Brother Brigham was "a message to <i>all</i> in this enterprise" (emphasis added). No one is exempt. The charge is intended to have an effect, President Eyring said, on "those who study, teach, and serve here." That seems to cover everyone: faculty, students, and staff.<br><br>It might also seem to describe the role of each of those groups. The students study, the faculty teaches, and the staff serve. However, I believe that this threefold description of learning, teaching, and serving not only makes clear that every person involved in this enterprise has a role to play but, more important, also describes the threefold responsibility that every person shares no matter what his or her particular role may be. In other words, I believe President Eyring's charge was for <i>all</i> of us to engage in <i>all</i> aspects of the direction given by President Young. Let me reiterate Brigham Young's instruction: Each of us--­faculty, staff, and students--are to "put forth [our] ability to learn as fast as [we] can, and gather all the strength of mind and principle of faith [we] possibly can, and then distribute [our] knowledge to the people."<br><br>To quote President Eyring, "Students, ­faculty, and staff" (note again the universality of the charge) should be "driven by a desire and a strength of mind to learn as fast as they can" and then to share their knowledge in ways that serve the needs of others.<br><br>President Eyring then used a distinctive phrase to describe the kind of university this effort would produce: "This is a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters." What a wonderful description this is of what we should be: a community of learners and lifters. I believe it is by creating a community of learners and lifters that we will best be able to play our individual roles in assisting individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.<br><br>Creating a community of learners and lifters is an ambitious and, I must admit, somewhat abstract goal. Just what does it mean at an operational level? I will confess that I don't fully know the answer to that question, and Iam inviting you today to begin a larger conversation about what it may mean to you both individually and as members of specific units on campus. However, let me offer a few more concrete thoughts that may help guide that conversation.<br><br>First, being part of a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters means that everyone should be using their strength of mind and faith to learn as much as they can about the field and enterprise in which they are engaged. For the faculty members this means that they need to be current--indeed, cutting edge--in their understanding of the discipline in which they are working. As faculty, we cannot simply dust off the notes of our classes that we have been using for years and teach from them. We must be involved in research, especially research that we can share with our students in some way. The result of this determined effort will be the discovery of new insights about both the specific substantive disciplines of the faculty and the methods of teaching that enhance learning.<br><br>But that same charge applies as well to those who work on the grounds crew or in the laundry or at the press or in dining services, technology, office work, or physical maintenance. There is something <i>each</i> of us can learn in our areas that will increase our knowledge and also increase our ability to perform our assigned tasks better.<br><br>But President Eyring's charge is to go beyond the mere acquisition of abstract knowledge, as essential as that is. It is a charge to consider ways in which that knowledge can have a practical application in helping others. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University seeks to improve and "sanctify" itself for the sake of others--not for the praise of the world, but to serve the world better.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The final requirement, then, is to look for opportunities to share that information with others so that their lives can be better. This may be easier for faculty who have a ready-made audience in the form of both students in their classrooms and peers in their discipline. But the charge extends to <i>all</i> involved in this enterprise. Each of us should look for ways to distribute the knowledge we have in such a way that it blesses others. For those in nonacademic units it may mean that you share the insights with coworkers or others engaged in similar activities outside the university or even with family members. For students it likely means sharing newly acquired knowledge with fellow students in class or other venues. And all of this sharing must be with the idea not of impressing others with how smart we are or how much information we know but with the desire to make others' lives better.<br><br>Imagine a community in which all members are truly engaged in an individual and collective effort to use all their minds and faith to learn as much as they can and as fast as they can, with the ultimate goal of sharing insights with others to improve their lives. Surely that would be both a vibrant and a determined community, to use President Eyring's phrase. And it would be a community that is alive with ideas and insights gained from a sustained, substantial desire to learn, as well as one with charity generated by that same kind of effort to use that knowledge to improve the lives ofothers.<br><br>We do not begin this effort at ground zero. As President Eyring noted, "Inspired leaders and teachers here have made it possible for students to begin to serve with what they have learned while they are still here" through mentored learning and other opportunities in which faculty invite students "to participate as partners in their own studies"--thereby lifting while they are learning.<br><br>Indeed, one of the distinctive traits of this university is the extent to which students have the opportunity to work with faculty members outside of class, including on specific research projects. In the most recent National Survey of Student Engagement survey of senior ­students, 36 percent of BYU seniors indicated that they had worked with a faculty member on a research project. That is 50 percent higher than the participation rate at other universities in our same Carnegie classification and even higher than that for other universities of our size.<br><br>Using data obtained from our alumni questionnaire and expanding the question toinclude any regular work with faculty outside the classroom, you can see the growth of faculty-student mentoring over the years, with the latest survey indicating that 49 percent of our students have had such a mentored learning experience before they graduate. Such experiences are invaluable preparation for so many things, including graduate school. Thus it is not surprising that the number of our alumni who three years after graduation have either completed or are in graduate school has also increased over the years--with the most recent data indicating that 40 percent of our alumni are in that category. While I understand the important difference between correlation and causation, I think it not entirely coincidental that those who have worked with a faculty member outside of class are more than twice as likely to attend graduate school as those who do not, as indicated by the data. Such one-on-one interaction is one prime example of the way in which faculty learners become lifters in the very process of learning.<br><br>For a number of reasons--including because we are beginning to reach the limits in some departments of the number of individualized experiences students can have on campus--we are increasingly relying on well-structured and well-planned off-campus internships in which we can partner with those outside our campus to provide transforming learning experiences to our students. Such experiences provide our students with both new opportunities to learn and additional venues in which to share what they have learned. We have over the years seen a marked increase in the percentage of our students who are taking advantage of these potentially transforming opportunities, with 56 percent of those in the most recent group for whom we have data having completed an off-campus internship while at BYU. Like mentored learning opportunities, internships can provide vital preparation for the next step our students will take in their quest for perfection and eternal life. Tellingly, in that regard, 49 percent of those who completed off-campus internships received a job offer in the subject matter of their internships.<br><br>Consistent with Brigham Young's vision, the impact of such experiences is not limited to the students themselves. In many instances students are able to share what they have learned in ways that extend the impact of what happens here well beyond the borders of our campus. You may have seen the extensive media coverage generated by a group of BYU mechanical engineering students in Professor Mark Colton's class.<sup>11</sup> These students focused their capstone project on helping children in wheelchairs. Motorized pediatric wheelchairs can cost up to $10,000. They are often so heavy that they are not able to go up steep inclines--thereby limiting the things that their occupants can do. So this class set out to design a lightweight wheelchair that could be constructed for less than $500. The results are shown in a video. [A video was shown.]<br><br>NBC News and other media outlets highlighted the project. That prompted email inquiries to BYU from throughout the world. Let me share just two examples.<br><br>From Rohan Mehra, exhibition content developer, Science Museum, London:<br><br><i> I develop ... exhibits on contemporary science and engineering at the Science Museum in London. We're curious about potentially displaying a version of the wheelchair and interviewing the minds behind it. Do you know if a version could be provided (at our cost) for a period?</i><br><br>Frank Niendorff:<br><br><i>Very impressive project. After reading about the wheelchair, I am interested in finding out </i>[whether] <i>the plans, specs, and material lists are available. I live in Austin, TX, am retired, have a full workshop, and would very much like to make some of these wheelchairs and give them to the children's hospital or other charitable organizations that support disabled children.</i><br><br>The last line of our mission statement expresses the firm belief that "the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission ... will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish to improve."<sup>12</sup> The wheelchair project is exhibit A, offered as proof that establishing a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters will better enable us to fulfill that charge.<br><br>With such persuasive evidence of the far-reaching and long-lasting positive impact of mentored learning and internships, it should be no surprise that we intend to make mentored learning and internship experiences a priority this year and in the years to come. We are looking for ways to increase both the number and quality of those opportunities for our students. We will use the endpoints of the rather impressive data of student involvement I cited today as the baseline for one measure of how successful we are in fulfilling our charge to become a community of learners andlifters.<br><br>As we do that, we anticipate that there willbe even more interaction between our faculty and staff on the one hand and our students on the other. As this happens, I implore you not to focus solely on the secular knowledge you will be sharing with our students. For us to fulfill our charge to be learners and lifters in the eternal and most important sense, we must also engage in spiritual mentoring. As you interact with these wonderful young people, keep in mind President Kimball's observation:<br><br><i>You can ... be more effective in the service you render students if students see you as individuals who have blended successfully things secular and things spiritual in a way that has brought to you earned respect in both realms.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>In that regard, President J.Reuben Clark Jr.'s admonition to never let your faith be difficult to detect is fully applicable to this enterprise.<sup>14</sup> I implore you not to hide what is most important to you and what will be most important to those whom you mentor. You can best help lift them at critical points in their quest for perfection and eternal life only if they clearly understand the true source of all knowledge and wisdom and service and power. We must ever point them to Him.<br><br>As we jointly and universally engage in the process of learning and lifting, we will create a community that is not only distinctive but in some ways unique. We have seen examples of that on this campus as well. As those who have been at BYU for some time will have discovered, employment slots, or FTEs, as we call them, are among the most valuable resources on campus. People can be hired to help in any part of campus only if there is an authorized FTE for that position, and those positions are limited. FTEs are sometimes more difficult to find than the funds to pay the salary. In most organizations, such precious resources would be carefully collected and guarded--and probably hoarded--within units. And yet, several years ago, the nonacademic support units on campus concluded that they could best help advance the mission of the university by consolidating their efforts and freeing up FTEs to be transferred to hire more faculty members. The six Teaching and Learning Faculty Fellowships announced this morning represent just a portion of the sacrifice made by the university's support services to make that happen. This is a remarkable example of consecration that is not likely to be found in many, if any, other places.<br><br>A similar example occurred this past year. As many of you know, we have for the past few years been raising funds for a new addition to the engineering building. Despite strenuous efforts and generous donations by many, the project seemed somewhat stalled last fall. During that fundraising period, DeanRod Brown of the College of Life Sciences noted that his college's need for a new facility had been generously and fully funded by the Church. Having been blessed in that way, he wondered if there was anything the College of Life Sciences could do to help with the engineering project. After some discussion, the College of Life Sciences agreed to make a significant donation to the engineering project, using funds that could appropriately be repurposed in that way. Shortly thereafter, the Division of Continuing Education made a similar donation, and then Print and Mail Services followed suit. When these remarkable donations were announced at a meeting of our major donors this past spring, one donor--who has been involved with a number of ­universities--commented, "This kind of thing would not happen at any other university." Ibelieve he is right. This is a unique academic community in which people by nature lift and help one another in unexpected, and almost miraculous, ways.<br><br>Let me give one concluding example--one that is perhaps less dramatic but likely more representative of the often unnoticed ways in which learning and lifting occurs on this campus.<br><br>As many of you know, law school can be very competitive. At most law schools, including BYU's, students are literally ranked in order by their grades, and employers often make the initial hiring decisions based primarily on that ranking. It is an environment rife with competition--looking at the other person, trying to better them. To add to the tension, in most law-school classes the seemingly all-important grade is determined solely on the basis of the final examination. As you might imagine, the stress levels at the law school are quite high during finals.<br><br>On one occasion I led a student discussion on pride and competition. In that setting, a first-year student, who had recently been through the soul-trying experience of the first set of law-school finals, related the following experience, which I share with his permission:<br><br><i>When I came to BYU Law School, I immediately developed a big, fat crush on my entire 1L class: they were the nicest, smartest, most interesting ­people that I had ever been around. ...</i> [Even though] <i>I realized right away that I was outgunned, outsmarted, and outpaced in every class ... , I didn't resent the successes of my peers; they were ... my friends, and I liked them. ...</i><br><br><i>As classes ended,</i> [however,] <i>and our 1L class threw all its weight, collectively and individually </i><i>..., toward finals, I was anxious. The anxiety grew and turned black. I studied hard and long, but I felt more insecure the more I studied.</i><br><br>The student went on to say that he began to stay away from his classmates because each interaction with them increasingly convinced him that they knew more than he did and that he was, therefore, destined to fail.<br><br>He then related:<br><br><i>I was praying early one morning about finals, asking for help to do my best</i> [or even to just pass the class], <i>and I began describing the bleak feelings I harbored, and I asked for help. After a few minutes, I</i> [suddenly] <i>found myself</i> [praying] <i>not</i> [just] <i>for myself but for my classmates, and not just for those few that I knew .</i><i>.</i><i>. struggled</i> [with the material,] <i>as I did, but for the gifted and the talented as well. I prayed that they would do their best, that they would have peace and clarity. As I prayed for them ... , I felt a surge of love for the classmates I had admired and had liked so much in the beginning.</i><br><br>He then began to reengage with his fellow students, not just to learn from them but with the thought that he might actually have something he could offer to them. At that point his stress level dropped dramatically, his learning increased considerably, and his view of law school and life was transformed. He was a learner and a lifter whose lifting amplified his learning. Who knew that finals, especially law-school finals, could be a spiritual experience? They can--and should be--at BYU.<br><br>And so we look forward to the coming year with optimism, knowing that as we become a vibrant and dedicated community of learners and lifters, we will truly assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.<br><br>There will be challenges. Some of what we do will not win the praise of the world; indeed, some of the things we do may be ridiculed. Events around us will cause some to question our values and our course of action. We are ready to address such challenges in ways that I may explain more fully at a future time. In the meantime, we can all take comfort, as did I, in the words of President Eyring at last September's inauguration:<br><br><i>In the midst of what may at times seem a tumult,</i> [President Worthen] <i>will be carried back to the view that is the heart of this university by the joy he has always found in being a determined learner and a mentor of other children of God. ...</i><br><br><i>... He will then find himself saying quietly in the face of what appear to be crises, "Things will work out."</i><br><br>I bear my witness that, as President Eyring testified, God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ live and that "They have been and always will be attentive to the needs of all who study and serve others here and who go on learning and serving others over their lifetimes and beyond." As we follow that clearly marked path, we will be blessed and prospered. I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen was president of Brigham Young University when this address was given at the BYU annual university conference on 24 August 2015.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>y Are You Swimming? - Peggy Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to fall semester. We hope you have all been able to settle into your new schedules. Fall semester can be a time of fresh starts. It can be a time of great expectations. It can also be a time when things are practically perfect. For example, it is probably safe to say that right now most of you have perfect grades in all of your classes! It can be a time when hopes run high and your roommate situation is quite fabulous. It is a time when all of our athletic teams are on course for ­tremendous seasons--yes, even perhaps national championships! And it is a time when you are able to meet new people, even perhaps that special someone.<br><br>The beginning of fall semester can indeed be an exciting time. You are most likely focused on a course of study and ready for what this new semester has to offer. We are excited for you! We hope that all of your expectations are met and that your experience here is a wonderfully memorable one. We also hope that as you are here at Brigham Young University and after you leave to pursue your own course in life, you will always take great care to do those things that will keep you out of harm's way, both temporally and spiritually; that you will have proper focus and perspective; and that you will heed the counsel of Nephi's brother Jacob, who said to his family, "O be wise; what can I say more?" (Jacob 6:12).<br><br>Sometimes as we embark and proceed on a new journey we find that our expectations are not met. What we had anticipated and hoped for in the beginning of our journey has not come to pass. Our ideals are not our realities. Maybe we are not getting the grades we had hoped for or we haven't met that special someone. Perhaps we didn't get the job we thought we deserved. We may find that things are just not working out as we had planned. The question then becomes, What will be our reaction to our unanticipated situation? What will we do? This is where I believe Jacob's counsel to "be wise" deserves serious attention.<br><br>At times, in these situations, the easiest thing to do is to place the responsibility for our situation on something or someone else. This is a dangerous course to take. It is harmful. It is extremely unwise. We see this in the Book of Mormon when people blamed their behavior on the traditions of their fathers. Not accepting responsibility for the direction of our own lives can distort our perceptions and can cause us to lose focus of the things that are important. It can cause us to become disoriented and can keep us from progressing. It is a waste of valuable time in these days of our earthly probation.<br><br>Another easy but unwise thing we might do during unforeseen situations is obsess about things we can't control. Recently I read about "a thrill-seeking photographer" who was described as a person who "often diced with death in the water."<sup>1</sup> He would repeatedly put himself into very dangerous situations in order to capture footage of extreme water events. Even though he "was described as an experienced waterman,"<sup>2</sup> this young man unfortunately died because of his dangerous fixation. He "drowned after he was sucked into a deadly whirlpool he was trying to film."<sup>3</sup> "There was a sign warning people not to swim [near the whirlpool], but it was ignored by [this young man]."<sup>4</sup> As this young man's family dealt with the loss of their son, they "warned others 'not to do this sort of thing'" and to "take heed of any warning signs present."<sup>5</sup><br><br>The image of this young man being drawn into a deadly whirlpool reminds me of how we can easily be drawn into dangerous situations if we lose focus. We need to be careful and heed the warning signs--such as promptings from the Holy Ghost, advice from our loved ones, or even counsel from Church leaders--sothat we will not be drawn into the potential whirlpools of life. When we dwell on things we can't control, we often fail to understand the gravity of the warning signs--or simply fail to even see them. Instead of looking for ways to overcome adversity, we sometimes focus on things we can't control. This causes us to murmur and wallow in self-pity. This can be deadly to our salvation. When we obsess over things we can't control or refuse to take responsibility for our actions, we become caught in a whirlpool. In other words, we stop progressing and are simply churned round and round by conflicting currents.<br><br>A perfect illustration of the different ways we can behave when encountering unexpected disappointments is found in the Book of Mormon. Nephi stated:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow. .</i><i>.</i>.<i> After Idid break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and ... they did suffer much for the want of food.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel ... did begin to murmur exceedingly. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i>Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having lost their springs, it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea, insomuch that we could obtain no food. ...</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow</i> [and] <i>an arrow. .</i><i>.</i>.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families.</i> [1Nephi 16:18–21, 23, 31]<br><br>Even though Nephi, Laman, and Lemuel were all equally suffering from want of food, each made a choice. Laman and Lemuel chose to blame Nephi and obsessed over the loss of his bow while apparently ignoring the fact that their own bows needed fixing. This did nothing to improve their situation. On the other hand, Nephi made the wise choice to progress. He took responsibility, focused on the things he could control, and did something about his family's situation.<br><br>It is important to keep a proper focus even when things are not going as planned. Instead of being caught in the whirlpools of life, as Laman and Lemuel often were, it is important to continue to progress toward our goals, no matter how difficult the situation may be.<br><br>I am reminded of the advice of a little fish named Dory to her friend Marlin while searching for Marlin's son, Nemo, in the 2003 Disney movie <i>Finding Nemo.</i> Marlin is very distraught over his missing son. Dory tries to encourage Marlin by telling him:<br><br><i>When life gets you down, do you wanna know what you've gotta do? ...</i><br><br><i>Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do wedo? We swim, swim.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>We will be held accountable for all we do. What will we do when faced with situations that could potentially cause us to lose our focus? Will we flounder by blaming others and losing focus so that we are sucked under by the whirlpools around us, or will we choose to keep swimming? I believe that we will be faced with unexpected situations throughout this life because that is the nature of this life. I also believe that we can prepare ourselves and be ready when these things happen. To prepare ourselves, we ought to follow King Benjamin's counsel:<br><br><i>Watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives.</i> [Mosiah 4:30]<br><br>As we do these things and choose to ­progress, even in the face of adversity, God "shall consecrate [our] afflictions for [our] gain" (2Nephi 2:2).<br><br>This is my testimony and my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy S.

<h1> Character - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I join Peggy in welcoming you to the new school year. For some of you, including an unprecedented number of returned missionaries, this will be your first semester as full-time students at BYU. Others are back for another round. For all, it is a wonderful time of new opportunities, challenges, and, we hope, optimism. As Peggy mentioned, the women's volleyball and soccer teams are both ranked nationally. The men's and women's cross-­country teams both won their first meets. And this past weekend the football team demonstrated that Book of Mormon scriptures apply to our times. Read Moroni 7:29 before you watch the replay of that last play.<br><br>Peggy next mentioned Laman and Lemuel in her talk. Several years ago, while reading the Book of Mormon, it dawned on me that I had probably been too hard on Laman and Lemuel. Or, more accurately, I realized, to my chagrin, that at times I had been more like them than I cared to admit. While we tend to think of Laman and Lemuel as disobedient rebels who never did anything right, the narrative from their perspective would probably have been much different. My guess is that for much of their lives, Laman and Lemuel considered themselves active members of the Church, doing the things that they were asked to do, even the hard things.<br><br>Think about it. When their father asked them to leave behind their riches, abandon their friends, and go out into the wilderness, did they go? Yes.<sup>1</sup><br><br>When their father asked them to return to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass from Laban--not an easy task--did they go? Yes.<sup>2</sup><br><br>When their father asked them to return again to get Ishmael and his family, they complied.<sup>3</sup><br><br>When their brother asked them to help build a boat, even though he had no prior experience in such an endeavor, did they help? Eventually.<sup>4</sup><br><br>And when they were instructed to get on that boat--to trust their lives and those of their families to a craft that had not only not been tested for seaworthiness but had also not been built in the normal manner--were they willing to trust their leaders and follow their instruction? Absolutely.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Given this outward obedience, in my mind's eye I can see Laman and Lemuel responding to their father's repeated entreaties to be obedient by saying, "We have done everything you have asked us to do. What more do you want?"<br><br>What Lehi wanted from his sons, and what God wants from us, is not just outward physical compliance but also inward spiritual commitment. He wants not just our acts but our hearts, minds, and souls. And if we don't give those to Him, eventually things will go wrong, as the experiences of Laman and Lemuel demonstrate.<br><br>In one sense, what separated Laman and Lemuel from Nephi was not so much their outward actions--although at critical times there were significant and telling differences in their actions, as Peggy has pointed out--but rather their inward attitude, which eventually became part of their character. If we had to choose one word to describe Laman and Lemuel's attitude toward life, my guess is that most of us would choose the word <i>murmur.</i> Laman and Lemuel were world-class murmurers. According to the Book of Mormon record, Laman and Lemuel murmured at least ten times,<sup>6</sup> and the number was likely higher. Nephi eventually gave up counting and simply noted, "I do not write upon these plates all the words which [my brethren] murmured againstme."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Yes, for the most part Laman and Lemuel did the major things that were asked of them, at least until they reached the promised land. But they did so reluctantly--mumbling, grumbling, complaining, and murmuring every step of the way and, as near as I can tell, making themselves and those around them quite miserable most of the time. The Book of Mormon makes clear that in the long run, this attitudinal difference eventually led to significant, even eternal, differences in the outcome of their lives. Their inward attitude eventually came to shape their characters and define who they were.<br><br>It was in regard to this attitudinal issue that I began to feel an uncomfortable kinship with Laman and Lemuel. I must confess that from time to time in my life I have been a bit of a murmurer myself. In fact, in my youth--Iam not proud to admit--I was quite proficient at it. In all my years of playing basketball, I'm not sure I ever agreed with a foul called on me! And I usually mentioned it at that very moment--often under my breath, sometimes out loud, but consistently complaining nonetheless. And eventually that began to spill over into other parts of my life. With that guilt on my mind and realizing the toll that such an attitude had had on Laman and Lemuel, I wondered what it was that made those two brothers so quick to murmur. Was it just part of their nature? Was it that they enjoyed being miserable? Or was there some other cause?<br><br>The Book of Mormon provides an answer to that question near the beginning of the account. The first time we read that Laman and Lemuel murmured is in 1 Nephi 2:11--only four pages into the record. In the next verse we read, "And thus Laman and Lemuel ... did murmur against their father." And then come these key words: "And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them."<sup>8</sup><br><br>There it is: the root cause. Laman and Lemuel murmured because they did not understand God's plan for them. They did not see the big picture. They couldn't see--or they forgot--that there was a larger purpose and broader reason for doing the things they were being asked to do. And when we don't understand the bigger picture--the reasons behind the things we are asked to do--any sacrifice is too great, any difficulty is too burdensome, and any inconvenience is a reason to complain, and we can soon end up like Laman andLemuel.<br><br>That is true of your educational experience at BYU as well. If you don't understand--or you forget--the real goal of this BYU experience, it will be difficult at times to do the hard things that acquiring the full benefit of that education will require. And without that perspective you may make your way through your education here in a grumbling, mumbling, murmuring sort of way, making life miserable for yourself and those around you.<br><br>To help you avoid this, let me explain, or--perhaps for most of you--remind you, of the purpose of your being here. It is set forth in some depth in the BYU mission statement and The Aims of a BYU Education document. These are two documents that I commend to you. The first line of the mission statement--hopefully somewhat familiar to all of you--states, "The mission of Brigham Young University ... is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life." That is our ambitious goal. And we do it, as the mission statement says, by providing "a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued."<sup>9</sup><br><br>The specifics of what that educational experience should entail are set forth in further detail in the mission statement and the aims document. Let me suggest that if you find yourself frustrated by some aspect of the university program--if, for example, you are irritated by the fact that you have to take all those GE courses on subjects you consider to be of no interest to you and of no importance to your anticipated career--in those moments read the mission statement and the aims document carefully to see if you might have a different perspective once you understand or are reminded of the ultimate purpose of this endeavor.<br><br>I do not intend by this suggestion to imply that every aspect of everything we ask you to do here is critical to your eternal salvation. Nor am I implying that all our programs are perfect or that we are not willing to discuss changes that might improve your experience here. However, I am confident that those conversations will be more productive, and more enjoyable, if they take place with a sound understanding of the larger picture of what we are trying to accomplish here.<br><br>The Aims of a BYU Education document sets forth four specific desired outcomes of your educational experience: "A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>10</sup><br><br>I have sometimes thought that the ­character-building part of those aims gets less attention than it should in our discussions. Maybe it is because character is so hard to define, and therefore harder to teach and measure, than most academic goals, but I tend to hear much less about that part of the aims in my conversations. And yet those who established the vision for this university at the highest levels have made it clear that character building is at the core of what we do here.<br><br>President David O. McKay taught:<br><br><i>Character is the aim of true education; and ­science, history, and literature are but means used to accomplish this desired end. ...</i><br><br><i>True education seeks to make men and women not only good mathematicians, proficient linguists, profound scientists, or brilliant literary lights, but also honest men</i> [and women] <i>with virtue, temperance, and brotherly love.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball was even more emphatic:<br><br><i>This institution has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the kingdom and bear witness of the ... divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not justified on an academic basis only.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_honor-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>12</sup></a><br><br>As then BYU president Dallin H. Oaks observed:<br><br><i>One of the most distinctive characteristics of Brigham Young University in this day is our proud affirmation that character is more important than learning.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>But just what do we mean by "character"? <i>New York Times</i> columnist David Brooks stated, "Character is a set of dispositions, desires, and habits."<sup>14</sup> And thus the aims document states, "A BYU education should reinforce such moral virtues as integrity, reverence, modesty, self-control, courage, compassion, and industry."<sup>15</sup> That is quite a list. But even a comprehensive list of attributes does not fully define character, because character is not about what we know but about who we are--and who we become.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>16</sup></a> It is about the heart and soul, not just the mind.<br><br>That is one reason why character is hard toteach, learn, and measure. As one observer put it:<br><br><i>The heart cannot be taught in a classroom intellectually, to students mechanically taking notes. .</i><i>.</i><i>. You can't teach it or email it or tweet it. It has to be discovered within the depths of one's own heart when a person is finally ready to go looking for it.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Because character is not taught or learned--or, to use the more accurate term, <i>built--</i>in the standard academic way, we need to look for ways in which we can all fully contribute to this endeavor as part of the BYU experience. In this regard, let me offer a couple of thoughts about ways in which character development can be taught and ways in which it can be learned.<br><br>One of the most powerful ways character development can be taught is by personal example. One observer noted:<br><br><i>What a wise person teaches is the smallest part of what they give. The totality of their life, of the way they go about it in the smallest details, is what gets transmitted.</i><br><br><i>Never forget that. The message is the person.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>We are blessed to have good role models of character at the university--both among the faculty and staff, as well as in the student body. To that end I would ask all of us to consider the impact our actions and decisions have on others. Our actions and attitudes may affect ­others--for good or bad--more profoundly than we realize. With the opportunity to influence comes the responsibility to do so properly. As I told our faculty and staff a couple of weeks ago, we should be part of a "community of learners and lifters" at BYU.<sup>19</sup> We should be a covenant community in which we help to build and strengthen each other's character every day.<br><br>Even more important, we are blessed to have before us the ultimate role model of perfect character--even the Savior Jesus Christ. We should, as the mission statement suggests, build an environment on campus and in our lives that reflects "those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God."<sup>20</sup><br><br>In addition to Christ's example, the gospel of Jesus Christ offers us access to the truths of the plan of salvation, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the redemptive, transforming power of Christ's Atonement. These inestimable gifts provide a comprehensive framework that gives us the opportunity to ultimately perfect our character. If we keep these things active in our lives, we can have the faith we need to keep going when we stumble--as we all will--and the power to improve--as we all must.<br><br>As for learning to build character, we should recognize that our character is usually shaped not by dramatic one-time events but by small and simple daily decisions. To quote David Brooks:<br><br><i>Character is a set of dispositions, desires, and habits that are slowly engraved. ... You become more disciplined, considerate, and loving through a thousand small acts of self-control, sharing, service, friendship, and refined enjoyment.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Or, to use the negative example of Laman and Lemuel, you become undisciplined, narcissistic, and rebellious through small acts of defiance, selfishness, and, yes, murmuring.<br><br>Accordingly, much of the vital character-building part of your quest for perfection will not take place in the normal course of classroom instruction. It will come in small moments and decisions that may seem only distantly related to your academic work but which, in the long run, will be more determinative of your ultimate success at the university. As the aims document puts it, character-­building opportunities will present themselves in a number of situations, including those involving<br><br><i>academic integrity in taking a test or writing a research paper; sportsmanship on the playing field; the honest reporting of research findings in a laboratory; careful use of university funds derived from the tithes of Church members; treating all other people with dignity and fairness; and wholehearted acceptance of commitments.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>With regard to that last item, let me mention in particular the commitments each of us has made with respect to the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards. I understand that some of those commitments relate to eternal values and others to standards that are more temporal and cultural. But let me emphasize that adherence to <i>each</i> of those standards plays a critical role in our eternal character development. Notice the helpful context provided in this statement by President SpencerW. Kimball:<br><br><i>Integrity (which includes the willingness and ability to live by our beliefs and commitments) is one of the foundation stones of good character, and without good character one cannot hope to enjoy the presence of God here or in the eternities. In this institution students and faculty commit themselves explicitly to abide by a code of conduct which includes both living by the moral precepts of the gospel and conforming to a dress and grooming code. Some purport to accept the moral standards as important and denigrate the other as trivial and as intruding on their freedom of choice. These people fundamentally misperceive the question, which is not whether the dress or grooming code is wise, but whether they should consider themselves bound by a promise. It is not that such a code is forced upon anyone; there is free choice to come here or to go to some other institution which makes no such demands.</i> ... <i>There is no disgrace in making that choice; it is a wholly legitimate option. But once having elected to come here and to participate in this community with its special calling to represent the Church and its highest standards, you must not compromise your integrity by promising what you will not do. By taking covenants lightly, you will wound your eternal self.</i><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_integrity-spirit-byu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>23</sup></a><br><br>Let me be a bit more specific about one dress and grooming standard that seems to be more of a challenge than it should be, if we look at it in the light of President Kimball's statement. I have noticed that a few men seemed to have focused on the statement in the Honor Code that "beards are not acceptable" and then have tried to convince themselves (and I suppose others) that two- or three- (or sometimes four- or five-) days' growth is not a beard. However, the BYU standard is a bit more precise. It clearly states: "Men are expected to be clean-shaven."<sup>24</sup><br><br>In his course syllabus, one of our BYU professors humorously observes that some may think that this "'scruffy three-day beard' look on guys ... is ... cool." However, showing a picture of a movie star, he then writes, "You are <i>not</i> this guy and never will be. The grooming standards say 'clean-shaven.'"<br><br>Now, we might disagree about whether this look is fashionable or whether, after you graduate, you <i>will</i> be that guy, but the undeniable and most important fact is this: As stated clearly in the Dress and Grooming Standards, "members of the BYU community commit themselves to observe the ... standards," including that men "be clean-shaven."<sup>25</sup><br><br>That same observation applies to the other parts of the Honor Code and the Dress and Grooming Standards as well. Having signed the Honor Code, compliance is not a question of fashion or personal expression. It is a question of integrity, which, as President Kimball said, "is one of the foundation stones of good character."<br><br>Overall, the vast majority of you are doing extraordinarily well in building and demonstrating good character. As one example, we recently surveyed those who have employed BYU graduates and asked them, among other things, to indicate how the BYU graduates they employed compared with graduates of other universities with respect to certain personal characteristics and skills that they considered important to success in their organization. With respect to "honesty, integrity, and dependability," 67 percent of the employers indicated that BYU graduates were "much ­better" or "somewhat better" than graduates from other universities.<sup>26</sup><br><br>Incidentally, as measured by the percentage of employers who thought that a particular characteristic or skill was "extremely important" in their organization, the category of "honesty, integrity, and dependability" was ranked highest, surpassing such things as problem-solving skills, critical-thinking skills, and communication skills.<sup>27</sup> As it turns out, quite often character pays.<br><br>But that is not the ultimate reward of character development, nor is employer satisfaction the best measure. Because character development is ultimately a question of inner attitudes and strengths, human beings, unaided by the Holy Ghost, can never fully and accurately measure how they are doing. But there are some close proxies.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks indicated that the scriptures suggest two ways in which we can measure ourselves--and I emphasize not measuring others but measuring <i>ourselves</i> inthis regard. First, noting the effect that King Benjamin's sermon had on his people, as recorded in Mosiah 5:2, Elder Oaks stated, "If we are losing our desire to do evil, we are progressing toward our heavenly goal."<sup>28</sup> Second, citing Paul's observation in 1 Corinthians 2:16 that those who have received the Spirit of God "have the mind of Christ," Elder Oaks observed that "persons who are proceeding toward [our ultimate goal of becoming like the Savior] are beginning to see things as our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, see them."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>29</sup></a><br><br>Let me suggest that both of these things--the development of an innate, inner desire to avoid evil and the ability to put things in eternal perspective--can be measured in a very rough sense by how much we are inclined to murmur, particularly when things are going wrong or we find ourselves at odds with those who have the charge to give prophetic counsel. At the end of the day, attitude shapes our character. If we can do hard but good things without complaint, we can find, in the words of David Brooks, that "there's joy in freely chosen obedience to people, ideas, and commitments greater than oneself."<sup>30</sup><br><br>But the impact does not end with ourselves. Others will be uplifted as they see your examples of character. A few years ago we received a letter from a woman in North Carolina who, from a long distance, had noted the character shown by one of our student athletes. The letter was accompanied by a personal check for a modest amount of money. I share portions of the letter with the author's permission. Shewrote:<br><br><i>Please find enclosed my check ... for the BYU Athletics Department. I am not wealthy. However, I want to offer financial support to an athletic program that has shown itself to be striving for a level of character that is consistent with its ­mission statement, although rare and inconsistent with current hedonistic views in this country.</i> [The student-athlete's] <i>honesty ... shows that he has a conscience--an excellent reflection on your school.

<h1>s Freedom and Fairness for All - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my dear friends and associates in this great cause. You are an impressive group this morning, with so much potential. I know your participation in these devotionals is highly recommended and encouraged, and many of you have homework, tests, and other commitments, so I thank you for attending and will do my best to make this morning worth your investment of time.<br><br>One of my Church assignments is to serve on the Public Affairs Committee of the Church. This is a First Presidency–directed committee, and I am very honored to serve under their leadership. The chairman over the committee is a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. In my tenure, those chairmen have been ElderL.Tom Perry and, before him, Elder M.Russell Ballard. Elder D. Todd Christofferson is currently the acting chairman. It is with the assistance of the Public Affairs Committee that I speak to you on an important topic that is attracting more and more public attention, and that is the subject ofreligious freedom.<br><br>Because you are a sophisticated and intelligent audience, I plan to speak with you with the candor that your generation craves. Isuspect that for some of you the phrase "religious freedom" feels more like "freedom to discriminate." I want to talk with you about this view and help you understand what the Church means when it talks about religious freedom and why it is so vitally important for your future and for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I also plan to address some misgivings and misunderstandings some of you may have when it comes to religious freedom.<br><br>Some of you might struggle with an understanding of religion's role in society, politics, and civic issues. Some in your age group wonder why religious groups are involved in politics in the first place, and they are often skeptical of the motives of religious people when they do so. In recent years the collective voice of groups who feel that religion should not play a role in political deliberation has grown louder.<br><br>The opportunity to be involved in the ­political process is a privilege given to every citizen. Our laws and legislation play an important teaching role in shaping our social and moral culture. We need every individual in society to take an active role in engaging incivic dialogue that helps frame laws and legislation that are fair for everyone.<br><h2><b>Freedom for All</b></h2><br>What are we talking about when we refer toreligious freedom? I am going to tell you the stories of two people who may be just a little older than you, and, as I do so, I would like you to think about how you would feel if you were one of these individuals.<br><br>The first story is about someone I will call Ethan. He had recently started his job in a career he had longed for, and he wanted to make a good impression. He came early to work and stayed late. He picked up extra projects and did excellent work. He was well liked by many of his colleagues and was enjoying his job. One day at lunch with a couple of coworkers he felt comfortable telling them that he was gay. An awkward silence developed because no one knew how to respond and the work environment was quite conservative. Ethan was disappointed by their cold response and felt hurt and rejected. He began to feel vulnerable at work and less valued.<br><br>After that lunch meeting, things became increasingly awkward for Ethan at work. He found himself excluded from large projects and social activities after work, and his productivity began to suffer, as he felt he did not belong and was not wanted. After a few months he was let go because his boss felt he was not keeping up. Despite all the claims to the contrary, Ethan knew he had been fired for being gay.<br><br>Now I want to tell you about Samantha. Samantha had just started work in the administrative offices of a local university. She was excited to work in a stimulating environment full of diverse thoughts, ideas, and backgrounds. One day at work a coworker approached Samantha and said she had heard that Samantha was a Mormon and asked if that was true. Samantha cheerfully responded that it was, but the question that followed brought her up short.<br><br>"So why do you hate gays?" her coworker asked. Samantha was surprised by the question but tried to explain her belief in God and God's plan for His children, which she believed included guidelines on moral and sexual behavior. Her coworker countered by telling her that the rest of society had progressed beyond those beliefs. "And besides," she said, "history is full of people using religious teachings to wage wars and marginalize vulnerable groups."<br><br>Samantha restated her convictions and her understanding of God's love for all people and then asked for her coworker to respect her right to believe. The coworker felt compelled to tell other employees about their conversation, and over the next few weeks Samantha felt increasingly isolated as more and more coworkers confronted her with questions and attacks.<br><br>Samantha's boss, seeing the increase in religious conversations in the workplace, cautioned Samantha against proselytizing in their work environment or her job would be in jeopardy. Her work, like Ethan's, began to suffer. Rather than risk being fired, Samantha started to look for another job.<br><br>Now, these are hypothetical stories, and yet they are not. There are many Samanthas and Ethans. However we choose to live and whatever choices we make, we all share a common humanity and desire for fairness and kindness. Ethan should not have been fired for being gay and Samantha should not have been intimidated for being religious. Both were wrongly criticized, judged, and retaliated against.<br><br>In today's society it is politically correct to empathize with Ethan's situation but less so with Samantha's. Ethan may find his case picked up by an advocacy group as yet another example of anti-gay discrimination. And, indeed, he does deserve protection.<br><br>But what about Samantha? Who will defendher right to religious conscience? What about her right to live authentically as a person of faith, committed to loving and serving everyone but also with the right to choose what is right and wrong and to live her life accordingly?<br><h2><b>Fairness for All</b></h2><br>Our society has become so blinded by its quest to redress wrongful discrimination against one class of people that it is now in danger of creating another victimized class: people of faith, like you and me.<br><br>Already some religious schools are being questioned because they require students and faculty to adhere to an honor code that requires fidelity and chastity. CEOs of large companies have been marginalized or forced to resign because their personal religious views are no longer politically acceptable. And some businesses have been forced to close because their owners have spoken their conscience.<br><br>Despite what you may have heard or read over the years, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has stood consistently for freedom of choice and conscience. Many years ago the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote:<br><br><i>We believe ... that all men are created equal, and that all have the privilege of thinking for themselves upon all matters relative to conscience.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>He later went on to say:<br><br><i>If ... I have been willing to die for a "Mormon,"... I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination; for the same principle which would trample upon the rights of the Latter-day Saints would trample upon the rights of</i> ...<i> any other denomination who may be unpopular and too weak to defend themselves.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>So what is the position of the Church on religious freedom? I can assure you that apostles and prophets, under the inspiration ofheaven, have given significant consideration to this issue. We believe in following the commandments of God, which are designed to secure our eternal happiness. However, "God will force no man to heav'n."<sup>3</sup> We believe in creating a space for everyone to live their conscience without infringing on the rights and safety of others. When the rights of one group collide against the rights of another, we must follow the principle of being as fair and sensitive to as many people as possible. The Church believes in and teaches "fairness for all."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Protecting conscience is about safeguarding the way someone thinks and feels and their right to act on those beliefs. I am talking about someone telling you that the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs you have are not allowed, valued, or acceptable because your views are not popular. A war in heaven was fought for agency, and it is a gross violation of that agency to force someone to betray their conscience because their views do not align with the crowd.<br><br>Please do not misunderstand me here. When I speak of us being authentic, the Lord does not give us a free pass to live any way we choose without consequences. We are still accountable to Him for our choices. He has said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."<sup>5</sup> The commandment to seek after perfection implies that we start where we are and seek the Lord's help to lift us to where He wants us to go. Being true to our authentic self requires continual effort to increase our light, knowledge, and understanding.<br><br>Your generation is the most "wired" in ­history. You are always connected. And you know that everything on the Internet is always, perfectly 100 percent accurate, right? All right then. So do not believe everything you have heard on the Internet about the Church and itsposition on gay rights.<br><br>A recent example of this "fairness for all" approach occurred in January of this year when we held a press conference with three apostles and a member of the Young Women general presidency to remind our members, the community, and the state legislature that the Church favors a balanced approach that secures the rights of all people.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks expressed the following at that press event:<br><br><i>We call on local, state, and the federal govern­ment to serve all of their people by passing legis­lation that protects vital religious freedoms for individuals, families, churches, and other faith groups while also protecting the rights of our LGBT citizens in such areas as housing, employment, and public accommodation in hotels, restaurants, and ­transportation--protections which are not available in many parts of the country.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>With the passage of protections for both LGBT and religious people six weeks later, our Church leaders and others congratulated the LGBT community. It was encouraging to see them protected across the state against eviction, housing discrimination, or being fired from a job because of their sexual orientation. We also congratulated our religious friends of other denominations, seeing them similarly protected in the workplace and in the public square.<br><br>Utah--and the Church--received national news coverage and praise for such a historic compromise. Now, note that no doctrinal or religious principles were sacrificed. No changes were made to God's moral law or to our belief that sexual relations should only occur within marriage between a man and a woman. The outcome was fair to all and reflected a consistency in moral standards and teachings and in respect for others.<br><h2><b>A Message of Fairness</b></h2><br>Not many of us will play prominent roles in government and law making, so you may be wondering how this topic pertains to you personally in your day-to-day life. I would like to talk with you now about three things you can do--each one of you--to support and promote a message of fairness.<br><br><b>First,</b> try to view others through a lens of fairness. To do this requires you to first acknowledge that Heavenly Father loves all of His children equally. He has said, "Love one another; as I have loved you."<sup>7</sup> There is no choice, sin, or mistake that you or anyone else can make that will change His love for you or for them. That does not mean He excuses or condones sinful conduct; nor do we, in ourselves or in others. But that does mean we reach out in love to persuade, to help, and to rescue.<br><br>When you feel completely and perfectly loved, it is much easier to love others and to see them the way the Savior does. Please turn to our Savior in prayer and ask to receive His pure love both for yourself and for others. He has promised that you will feel His love if you ask in faith.<br><br>Being filled with this pure love will guide your thoughts and actions, especially in a political arena that can at times be very contentious. Tensions can flare easily when discussing politics, and especially when discussing religious freedom. If we allow these moments to get the better of us, we will appear very unchristian to our family, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. Remember how the Savior handled tough questions and challenging viewpoints. He remained calm, He showed respect, and He taught truth, but He never forced anyone to live the way He taught.<br><br><b>Second,</b> let fairness guide your treatment of others. Jesus Christ looked past people's ethnicity, rank, and circumstances in order to teach them simple truth. Remember the Samaritan woman at the well, the Roman centurion, and the unpopular publican. The Lord has commanded us to follow His example, saying, "Ye shall observe to do the things which ye have seen me do."<sup>8</sup> Do not judge people or treat them unfairly because they sin differently than you, or we, do.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest challenge in ­treating others fairly is in the balance required in supporting religious freedom when you have friends or family members who experience same-sex attraction or who are firm supporters of their rights. Some of you worry that you will appear intolerant or unsupportive if you seek protections to exercise your faith publicly and freely.<br><br>Again, study the life of our Savior and seek His guidance. The Savior demonstrated perfectly how to reach out in love and encouragement while also holding firm to what we know to be true. Remember that when the woman was caught in adultery, the Lord asked for anyone without sin to step forward and be the first to condemn her. When no one approached, our Savior, who was without sin, commented, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."<sup>9</sup> The forgiveness and kindness He showed her did not contradict His teachings that sexual intimacy is meant for a husband and a wife who are legally and lawfully married. You too can be unyielding in right and truth yet still reach out in kindness.<br><br>When Christ's friends and followers ended their relationships with Him, He expressed sadness and pain. However, when a relationship did end, it was because they were uncomfortable with His teachings, not because He was uncomfortable with them.<br><br>As we seek to treat others fairly, we must remember the principle of agency. We must always respect the ability of others to make choices and ask that they extend to us the same courtesy. When talking with others about religious freedom, we must always remember that we can disagree without becoming disagreeable. Please do not shy away from a dialogue regarding these important issues simply because you are worried that it might be difficult or uncomfortable. We can pray for help, and we can expect that the Savior will help us speak and act in a way that is pleasing to Him.<br><br><b>Third,</b> I would encourage you to stand up for fairness if you see another's rights being impeded. Elder L. Tom Perry was a great example of someone who firmly believed in man-woman marriage, and yet he was willing to stand up for the rights of others. He left an example of ensuring that others' rights were protected when he witnessed unfair treatment or an imbalance in our laws.<br><br>From the time of Joseph Smith to our ­present day, our legacy is one of reaching out to heal breaches and hurt without compromising the doctrine that is not ours to trade away.<br><h2><b>The Need for Active Involvement</b></h2><br>This brings me to my final point, and thatis the need for active involvement from your generation on this topic. I stand with the leaders of our Lord's Church when I say that we need your generation's natural understanding of compassion, respect, and fairness. We need your optimism and your determination to work through these complex social issues.<br><br>We have faith that you will turn to the Savior to understand how to live a Christlike life while also showing fairness and love to others who do not share your beliefs. We know you want to be a part of something meaningful, and we know that you are resilient and collaborative.<br><br>Most important, we need you to engage in dialogue regarding the complexities of this issue and find solutions for how to best extend fairness to everyone, including people of faith. These conversations need to be occurring in our schools--perhaps right here at Brigham Young University--in our homes, and in our ­relationships with friends and coworkers.<br><br>When you have these conversations, please remember the principles we have discussed today, which are simply these: see others through a lens of fairness, treat them with respect and kindness, and expect the same treatment in return.<br><br>As you do these things, I want you to please report back to me. I want to hear about your experiences and the successes you are having in creating friendships with those who see life differently than you do. On my RonaldA. Rasband Facebook page, I have posted about my devotional remarks. In the next few days, will you head to my page on Facebook? I would love for you to leave me a comment about your desires for and experiences of spreading our message of fairness for all. I want to hear from you! I know some of you prefer Instagram and Twitter, but I am hoping for ­stories that are longer than 140 characters! Please write me.<br><h2><b>An Increase of Love</b></h2><br>Finally, I want to leave you with my testimony and my witness that as you follow our invitation to reach out to others in a spirit of fairness, you will feel an increase in the Savior's love for you and for all of Heavenly Father's children. Your example of respect and fairness will open doors and create meaningful friendships that you will cherish throughout your life.<br><br>I witness to you that our Heavenly Father lives, that He knows you, and that He loves you personally. He stands ready to help you during this exciting and challenging time of your life. He has revealed His plan to us not only so that we can return and live with Him forever but also that we can be blessed and be happy in this life. As you follow His teachings and as you reach out in love and consideration to others, you will feel even more His power and His love.<br><br>Of these truths I bear witness to you, as well as of my love for our Savior and my knowledge that He loves you and cares for you, each and every one. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><em>Ronald A.

<h1>g Worthy Mentors - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several weeks ago I came home from work and announced at the dinner table to my wife and two of my daughters that I would be speaking at the BYU devotional on September 29. My wife, Lynn, immediately said, "Honey, what an amazing opportunity, and it will still be early enough in the semester that people will actually be there!"<br><br>Lynn, I am happy to say that you were right--there actually are a lot of people here--and it is my prayer that over the next half hour I can share a few thoughts that will encourage you to have perfect attendance for the rest of the year.<br><h2><b>Find and Become a Worthy Mentor</b></h2><br>Thirty-five years ago--can it be that long?--I was a freshman at BYU. As great and exciting as BYU athletics are today, those were some of the golden years of BYU sports. Jim McMahon threw long touchdown passes to Danny Plater, and in basketball Danny Ainge and Devin Durrant were ruling the court. The track team was also bursting at the seams with greatness. Many of my teammates were already All-Americans, and Mormon distance running would soon lead to a <i>Runner's World</i> article titled "Stormin' Mormons" (see John Brant, "Stormin' Mormons," <i>Runner's World</i> 23, no.5 [May 1988]: 70–76). It was into this athletically charged environment that I found myself as an unproven freshman, a recent graduate of Ogden's Bonneville High School.<br><br>Each day as a team we would pound out ten-mile runs, tempo workouts, or mile repeats. On occasion we would run to the top of Squaw Peak. At the end of such days we would usually end up in the athletic training room, where a whirlpool bath or steam room awaited.<br><br>Some of my older, more decorated teammates also enjoyed a weekly ritual that I envied. Ollie Julkunen was our cross-country and track athletic trainer. He had grown up in Finland, where he had been an accomplished national-class boxer. Later in life he learned the art of healing aching muscles and speeding recovery by putting those strong boxing hands and shoulders to use, giving deep athletic muscle massages. I would watch as Doug Padilla, a decorated All-American, would jump on Ollie's padded table. Ollie would soon have Doug squirming as he worked first his quadriceps and then his calf muscles, always ending with the hamstrings. At the end of each twenty-minute massage, Doug was usually much more relaxed, and as Ollie finished up and shook out Doug's hamstrings, he would say with his thick Finnish accent, "Soup in a sack, soup in a sack--that is what your muscles should feel like. Soup in a sack." After this final Ollie blessing, Doug would usually slide gently off the table, a picture of relaxation and recovery.<br><br>After witnessing this procedure for a number of weeks, I decided it was time for me to enjoy some of Ollie's special treatment. So as Doug slid off the table, I jumped on and casually said to Ollie, "Yeah, Ollie, I want what he just had."<br><br>Ollie looked at me somewhat disdainfully as he squinted through his glasses. "What is your name?" he asked.<br><br>"Uh, Ed Eyestone."<br><br>"Hmm, StoneEye," he said (and StoneEye would be his name for me for the next ten years), "there is a saying in Finland. It goes: '<i>Älä tuhlaamustaruuti pikku linnut.</i>'<i> </i>Do you know what that means?"<br><br>"No, Ollie, I'm a little rusty on my Finnish."<br><br>"It means 'Do not waste the black powder on the little birds.' Do you know what that means?"<br><br>"Yes," I said, "it means I won't be getting a massage today."<br><br>As I slunk off his table he said, "StoneEye, get back on the table." And then for the next twenty minutes I enjoyed that exquisite pain as he first worked on my quads, then on my calf muscles, and finally on my hamstrings. As he finished he said, "Soup in a sack, soup in a sack--that's how your muscles should feel, like soup in a sack."<br><br>Ollie Julkunen knew the proper technique for a deep Finnish sports massage, which I am sure is one of the reasons I stayed relatively healthy over the course of my running career. More important, Ollie knew that in serving others it was impossible to waste the black powder on the little birds, for the Lord loves His little birds and knows when even one sparrow falls: "Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows" (Matthew 10:31).<br><br>I am grateful for all those who wasted their black powder on this little bird over the years. One of our great challenges as students and faculty is to find great role models and mentors like Ollie Julkunen and to learn from their accumulated wisdom. May we have the courage to ask for help from all the Ollie Julkunens that the Lord puts in our path. Similarly, we should pray daily for opportunities to share our knowledge, wisdom, and time with the little birds that flutter into our lives. As we do so, we express our love for our Savior, for He has said, "Lovest thou me? [Then] feed my sheep" (John 21:16).<br><h2><b>Take Direction Well</b></h2><br>As the father of six daughters, I have always looked for ways to better connect with my girls. For example, each knows that she is my favorite, and I take advantage of every opportunity to express that to them both privately and publicly.<br><br>It was easy with Erica, favorite daughter number one, as she got a three-year head start on her next closest sister, and she was always interested in sports, so there were many days spent hitting fly balls, hiking, kicking a soccer ball, or even playing basketball--a game that she excelled at enough to walk on at BYU for a year, despite my ineptness at the game.<br><br>Andrea and Ellie, favorite daughters two and three, enjoyed cross country and track, which made attending their races all the more fun because, in addition to watching and cheering at their races, I could do a little recruiting of other athletes on the side. My cheer of "Make their lungs bleed!" to Andrea, although initially intended as a joke, became a standard battle cry at all her races, and to this day it is code for good luck between us. In fact, this morning I received a text from Washington, DC. It ended with "Make their lungs bleed!" You've been forewarned.<br><br>With Ellie, the importance of a good attitude early in the race led to the cheesy but memorable cheer of "Happy face, happy race!"<br><br>But Claire, favorite daughter number four, gravitated more to the music and drama side of the continuum. I was perfectly content to attend recitals, music programs, and elementary and junior high productions, but in the summer before her ninth-grade year, I decided to step it up a notch. Despite the fact that I had last been onstage thirty-five years earlier in the ward roadshow as a wolf who developed a conscience, we both ended up in a summer community-theater play of <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i> at the SCERA Center for the Arts in Orem, Utah. Two words: <i>beard card.</i><br><br>As a result of that experience in fall 2011, I was invited to audition for a production of the musical <i>White Christmas,</i> performed by the BYU Department of Theatre and Media Arts. <i>White Christmas</i> would play the month of December, leading into Christmas, and would feature mostly music dance theatre majors. These guys were pros. They had been in productions for most of their young lives, and many, if not all, would go on to professional careers in the performing arts, some on Broadway. I am sure the only reason they had opened up the role of General Waverly--the stern army general with a heart of gold--to the outside was that they wanted someone older for the role. And although it might be a stretch for such a young-looking fifty-year-old at the time to play a retired general fifteen years his senior, I figured that was what acting was all about, and I went to the audition.<br><br>When I arrived, I was introduced to the director, George Nelson, a professor in the theatre department. He asked me to sing a few bars to make sure I wasn't completely tone deaf and to read a brief monologue. Fortunately there was no dancing required, as the general had recently taken some shrapnel to the leg. The monologue was of General Waverly saying good-bye to his troops. I read it through once in my mind and then proceeded to read it out loud for the director. I attempted to convey the gruffness and authority of a World War II general. Unfortunately my interpretation came out sounding more like a combination of John Wayne from <i>True Grit</i> and Arnold Schwarzenegger from <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>. When I finished and looked at the director's table, Icould tell by the sideways glance and pursed lips that I hadn't been too convincing.<br><br>But instead of dismissing me outright with a wave of the hand and a "next," Brother Nelson exhibited true mentorship as he flexed his directing muscles. At that point George looked me firmly in the eyes and said something to the effect of, "Ed, that was okay, but let's try it again. You're a coach, right? And you work with young men? I imagine that, as a coach, you form close associations with these guys. You put in a lot of time with these guys as you lead them into battle in the races, correct? Now this time I want you to put yourself in the position of this general, but imagine instead that these soldiers are the young men you coach every day. You have been serving side by side with these men for the last two years. You have risked your life and have been wounded in battle as a result of saving some of their lives. You have seen men who were part of this group make the ultimate sacrifice in fighting for their country. These are your boys, and you have to leave them now. You may never see them again, and some will be killed before the end of the war. Now take a minute and then try it again."<br><br>During that minute I thought a couple of things: (1) I was in way over my head. (2) I thought about my father, who had been a paratrooper in World War II and was the greatest man I ever knew. (3) I did what George asked me to do and I thought about my boys--the young men I get to coach here at BYU--the championship races I had witnessed them run, and the personal sacrifices they had made. I then attempted to read the farewell monologue. The result was a much different performance than the initial superficial reading. As I finished the reading with thoughts of my own team and of my father, my eyes filled with tears and my voice slightly broke with emotion as General Waverly said his final farewell to his men.<br><br>As I finished the reading this time, I looked to the director's table and was greeted with a smile as George said, "That was much better."<br><br>And I said to myself in all humility, "Nailed it!"<br><br>The difference, however, had been in a great director.<br><br>I was grateful for those next three months as I got to rub shoulders with real pros. It was fun to see that the same qualities of talent, hard work, dedication, sacrifice, teamwork, and coaching that make a successful sports team also come together to make a successful stage production. My goals were modest--mainly not to get in the way of the true professionals who were out on the stage.<br><br>The play was sold out for all of the performances. However, when the reviews came out, we all were anxious to see how we had been critiqued. The production received very favorable reviews, and the <i>Deseret News </i>on November 16, 2011, used such phrases as "energetic choreography" with "high-stepping, attractive performers." My fellow performers were praised by name for their onstage enthusiasm, fully formed characters, and plum performances and for singing and dancing with vigor. When I nervously read my own review it said--and I quote--"Ed Eyestone is the right age to play [General Waverly]" ("<i>White Christmas </i>and Other Irving Berlin Classics Staged with Affection at BYU," <i>Deseret News, </i>16 November 2011, deseretnews.com/article/705394426/White-Christmas-and-other-Irving-Berlin-classics-staged-with-affection-at-BYU.html). Nailed it! Broadway, here I come!<br><br>At the end of the run of the play, I had a chance to introduce my wife, Lynn, to George Nelson, my new theatrical mentor. He paid me the biggest compliment and gave me the best review when he said, "Ed takes direction well."<br><br>Everyone loves to give direction. It is fun to tell others what to do and when and how to do it. However, taking direction is a serious challenge for most of us because pride turns direction into criticism in our minds. Despite grade inflation, not every paper we turn in at school will return with a gold star and a smiley face at the top of the page. How we handle criticism or, better said, how we handle direction ultimately is a measure of our character and will help determine how far we go in life. If we can embrace direction rather than look at it as criticism, we are much more likely to learn and improve. If we are offended by direction, we are more likely to become stagnant and wither. Ultimately, taking direction well requires us to trust in the director. When we trust in the director, we check our pride at the door and become humble. It is only then that we truly maximize our learning potential.<br><br>On those occasions when we are required to give direction, we should be like George Nelson and give good direction. Many times this simply requires taking a moment to consider the Golden Rule and "do unto others as you would have them do unto you," or direct others as you would have them direct you. At the audition George could have easily said, "Eyestone, that was the worst impression of John Wayne I've ever heard. Please never step on my stage again." But instead he made the effort to give good direction and searched for just the right words to elicit a better performance.<br><br>Fortunately, here at BYU we are blessed not only to have many worthy mentors in whom we can trust but also to worship the Divine and Perfect Mentor of us all who has said:<br><br><i> Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall </i><b><i>direct</i></b><i> thy paths.</i> [Proverbs 3:5–6; emphasis added]<br><br>If we could spend more time trusting and taking direction well and less time ­giving direction and worrying about criticism, Ibelieve we would be a happier and more ­productive society.<br><h2><b>Sweat the Small Things</b></h2><br>Kyle Perry was a track athlete recruited from Alta High School in Utah. After returning from a mission to New Jersey, Kyle began what would be a very successful track and cross-country career at BYU. However, at the beginning of his junior year he admitted to being somewhat frustrated by the fact that, despite being an All-American, he had not yet been able to break four minutes in the mile.<br><br>Fifty years ago the sub-four-minute mile was considered a nearly impossible physiological feat--although when Roger Bannister finally accomplished the task in 1952, a succession of others soon followed. However, it is still considered a landmark accomplishment, and far fewer people have run a sub-four-minute mile (about 1,400) than have climbed Mount Everest (more than 4,000). Kyle's personal record at the time stood at 4:05--certainly a better-than-average college time but far from world class.<br><br>At the end of cross-country season that fall, Kyle came into my office with a proposal. "Coach," he said, "I feel like in track I have kind of plateaued. I'm stuck at 4:05, and I'm not getting any faster."<br><br>"Well," I asked, "what are we going to do about it?"<br><br>He said, "I don't think there is one single thing I can do to cut off five seconds, but I do think there are ten things I can do that can each cut off half a second and together will total five seconds and get me under four minutes."<br><br>He then pulled out his list, which read something like this:<br><br><i> For the next three months I will:</i><br><br><i> 1. Do my morning runs</i><br><i> 2. Stretch after workout</i><br><i> 3. Do core five times a week</i><br><i> 4. Get to bed before 11:00 p.m.</i><br><i> 5. Lift weights twice a week</i><br><i> 6. Do sprint drills twice a week</i><br><br>The last four changes were dietary in nature:<br><br><i>7. Eat breakfast every day</i><br><i> 8. No more ice cream</i><br><i> 9. No more diet coke</i><br><i> 10. No more candy</i><br><br>We all would probably benefit from those last four. After going through the list, he added, "Coach, on February 2 the track team is going to Seattle for an indoor meet, and I'm going to break four minutes for the mile." He then turned the list into a legally binding contract by signing it at the bottom. I signed it as well, and we posted a copy on my wall and a copy in his locker.<br><br>Over the next three months I met with him regularly for his daily workouts, and he let me know how his ten small things were coming along. As we flew to Seattle that first week of February, he was brimming with confidence. Not only had he paid the price on the big things, like running eighty miles a week and never missing a practice, but he had also made the additional sacrifices to do the small things that he felt would make the ultimate difference.<br><br>On February 2, at the University of Washington indoor track, after a slow opening three laps, Kyle ran fifty-seven seconds for his last 400 meters and became the 302nd American to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.16. Contrary to popular opinion, he found that sweating the small stuff was necessary to accomplish big things and get him to a whole new level. Building on his breakthrough, Kyle won the national championships in the steeplechase that next year.<br><br>My time working with Kyle Perry helped reinforce a scripture found in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>So often we find ourselves looking for that big break, the huge testimony-defining experience, the job or investment that will set us for life, or the bolt of lightning and fireworks when we find Mr. or Miss Right--some of you are waiting for that, aren't you? While those events can occur, more often than not it is by consistent, competent effort, by the small things that we pay attention to, that ultimately and eventually lead us to excellence. Consistent competence equals eventual excellence, or c<sup>2</sup> = e<sup>2</sup>, as I sometimes say.<br><br>The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow had this in mind when he said:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><i> Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><i> Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br>[<i>The Ladder of St. Augustine</i>(1858), stanza 10]<br><br>I would challenge us all to take a personal inventory of some of the small things we can work on in the coming months that will help break us from the spiritual, mental, and physical plateaus on which we might currently reside.<br><h2><b>Value Work, Effort, and Struggle</b></h2><br>During my freshman year there was one goal that sounded like it would etch my name into athletic immortality: being named an All-American. The glorious thing about being named first-team All-American is that from that moment on you are no longer referred to by your name alone, at least not in college. "All-American" precedes your name like a title, almost like royalty: "Prince Charles, I would like you to meet All-American Ed Eyestone," or so I thought it would go. Further, I decided I wanted this title my freshman year. I didn't want to wait until I was a senior.<br><br>To become All-American meant making it to the national meet and then finishing in the top six in your event. Unfortunately, cross-country season came and went without our team making it to the national meet. So too passed the indoor season. And so it would come down to the outdoor track season to determine if my All-American dreams for my freshman year would actually come true.<br><br>I was running the most exciting event in track and field. Some people mistakenly think that is the 100-meter dash. No--sorry, Usain Bolt. The most exciting event in track and field is the 10,000 meters--6.2 miles, or 25 laps of screaming intensity. Back then the qualifying time for 10,000 meters was 29:19, and during the final qualifying meet of the year, I ran 29:18 and qualified by one second. In a race that lasts as long as an episode of <i>The Simpsons,</i> I qualified by one second; I was the slowest qualifier going into the national meet. But I was ecstatic, for now if I finished in the top six, I would be an All-American my freshman year.<br><br>That year nationals were in Austin, Texas, where there was an incredible heat wave taking place. Coach Sherald James, our beloved distance coach and mentor, tried to prepare me as well as possible for the heat and humidity. Some days it was by doing long runs in two pairs of sweats during the heat of the day; other days it was by taking a stationary bicycle into the steam room and pedaling as if being pursued by a rabid dog.<br><br>When I arrived in Austin from Provo, it was like stepping onto another planet--the planet of liquid heat, apparently. On the day of the race the temperature trackside was more than 100 degrees--a fact made painfully obvious by a temperature gauge strategically placed trackside. Although the race was postponed until 9:00 p.m., the conditions were still dangerously oppressive. The solution was a creative but improvised effort: a garden hose was attached to a nearby sprinkler, and we were counseled that as we found ourselves overcome by the heat, we were to raise our hands high above our heads, and the man on the hose would squirt us as we ran past.<br><br>The race began, and by three laps we were all raising our hands as we ran by the man with the hose. At first the water was somewhat refreshing--you've all experienced the sensation of running through the sprinklers. It kind of takes your breath away as you go through. It feels good. But after getting squirted four, five, six, and seven times, you realize that the water is lukewarm and that due to the humidity there is little to no evaporative cooling effect. Instead the lukewarm water is running down your legs and pooling in your shoes and you are sloshing around the track. And then you don't want to be squirted anymore, but the guy next to you raises his hand.<br><br>I knew I was not going to win my freshman year, but I had hope for a top-six performance, so I stuck determinedly insixth place, keying off of a Kenyan from UTEP (the University of Texas at El Paso). Just past the 5k mark, the UTEP runner's head began to wobble. He staggered and fell to the infield. Being a caring human, my first response was to stop and render assistance to my poor fallen comrade, but instead I spiked him, and on I went. Yes! I hadn't even had to pass him; he passed out and now I was in fifth place and could almost see the All-American certificate proudly displayed above my mantle--although I don't think I had a mantle yet.<br><br>With two laps to go, it was <i>my</i> head that felt like a cherry tomato, and though I was fighting for all I was worth, I could tell I was losing ground. In a race, you never want to look behind you, as that is a sure sign to your chasers that you are tired, but by the sound of the sloshing shoes approaching, I could tell that two runners were gaining. If both of them passed me, I would go from All-American my freshman year to almost All-American.<br><br>One of the runners passed me and the other was now on my shoulder. I dug for all that I had. It was going to come down to a kick, and that was not my forte. And then something happened: suddenly my world was in slow motion, and instead of running in a straight line like you want to do in a race, I was running a little to the left and a little to the right as I started weaving down the track. I watched as the two runners pulled away from me and my All-American dreams for my freshman year disappeared. Things were out of focus, and I was running toward a bright light. The only clear memories I have of the moments after this were of me being dragged from the track and saying, "I need to finish!" and my coach saying, "You're finished, Ed. Believe me--you're finished." Then the man with the hose intervened for one last squirt.<br><br>I came to in the training room at the University of Texas in a metal Jacuzzi tub filled with cold water and ice. Next to me was my Kenyan friend from UTEP. The doctors monitoring our conditions explained that our body core temperature had gotten so high that we had triggered a safety switch at the base of the brain that shuts off motor activity, and hopefully at that point you fall into a cool, shady oasis and survive. After about thirty minutes in the ice tub, my body core temperature returned to normal, and I was able to get up, shower, and go back to my hotel.<br><br>But I was disappointed--really almost devastated. I had done everything right. I had set a worthy goal, committed myself, worked hard to accomplish it, and sought divine intervention. And yet I had come up a lap short of being All-American my freshman year. It would never happen.<br><br>Coach James recognized my disappointment and attempted to cheer me up by saying, "Ed, that sure was a fun race to watch. It looked like you were going to do it, and then you started weaving."<br><br>"Great," I thought. "Happy to have entertained you, Coach!"<br><br>Then he went on: "Ed, today you ran like a horse!"<br><br>He could still tell I was not impressed by the simile, so he explained further: "You know, you can take a good mule up in the mountains, and the mule will do a lot of work for you. You can take it hiking or hunting. But when a mule gets tired, it will stop. You can push it, you can pull it, and you can motivate it with a stick, but until it has recovered, it will go nowhere. But," he continued, "if you have a good horse, you can run with that horse until it drops over, completely exhausted or completely dead. Today you ran like a horse."<br><br>And you know what? That made me feel better--the fact that he thought I had given it that kind of effort. I think what my good mentor Coach James taught me at that time was that life is structured such that many times we are going to do everything possible to accomplish our goals, but the nature of life is that sometimes, despite doing all the right things, we are going to come up a little short. But if we have done everything in our power--if we have run like a horse--then that is all that is required. We can hold our heads high. We're going accomplish a lot in the process.<br><br>The other takeaway from that story is that after my mission I made All-American ten times, but the fact is, I don't cherish or remember those ten times I had success nearly as much as the one time I came close and Coach James said I ran like a horse. We often learn more from our so-called failures than from oursuccesses.<br><h2><b>Trust in the Divine Mentor</b></h2><br>May we take advantage of the many ­mentors who surround us this year, and may we be worthy mentors to those whom we serve. May we not just take direction but may we take direction well, without taking offense. May we see the value of gradual steps in the right direction. Despite the result, let us appreciate the value of work, effort, and struggle as we run like a horse in all that we do. And may we remember that we have a Divine Mentor who loves us unconditionally and is always there to lift us when we fall. These things I testify in His name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ed Eyestone was the BYU track and field director and men's cross-country coach when this devotional was delivered on 29 September 2015.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>en Is Light - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am humbled to stand where prophets, apostles, General Authorities, university presidents, important scholars, and world leaders have stood. As a student at BYU thirty years ago, I attended the devotionals and forums quite faithfully. Iloved taking a break once a week to listen to remarkable individuals share their insights on a myriad of topics. I enjoyed listening and learning without any worry that I might be tested on what I was hearing. It was education at its best.<br><br>I am what I used to refer to as the dark horse in the devotional lineup. A dark horse is a completely unknown quantity with no name recognition whatsoever. You are probably like one of my students who looked at the list of speakers for the semester and asked, "Why are you on the list?"<br><br>My response to her was, "I don't know! I've been asking myself the same question!" But whatever the reason, I am here, and I hope that something I share this morning will move you to open your hearts to the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and that you will be encouraged in your efforts to follow our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Invitation</b></h2><br>One of my favorite scriptures is found in Matthew 11. It is Christ's universal invitation that speaks to each of us personally:<br><br><i> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br><br><i> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br><br><i> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </i>[Matthew 11:28–30]<br><br>I love this passage because in a few short verses Christ lays before us the path to eternal life. The overtones and undertones of these verses resonate with truth. First, the very fact that this is an invitation to "come," to "take," and to "learn" indicates an acknowledgment of and a respect for our agency. This respect for agency causes me to think of our premortal life, when we fought in our Father's army to preserve and maintain the condition of agency in this life. It seems right that Christ, who is the linchpin in our Father's plan of happiness, would acknowledge that it is our choice to come unto Him or not.<br><br>I also appreciate the simple promise of rest that is given. Having labored under sin and its heavy weight of guilt and separation from God, I am grateful for the rest and reconciliation Christ promises to those who come unto Him.<br><br>I find great meaning in the word <i>yoke.</i> It evokes so many important things about Christ's path. A yoke is a wooden bar or frame by which two draft animals are joined at the neck for the purpose of working together to pull a heavy load. A yoke is also a frame fitted to a person's shoulders to carry a load in two equal portions. Whether we envision a double or a single yoke, the Savior is part of this image. We are either teamed with Him, side by side, or we are carrying His yoke. Yokes imply burdens or heavy loads; thus by taking His yoke upon us we are also taking upon us the load to which it is attached.<br><br>The sequence of first taking and then learning indicates that this isn't an armchair exercise of the intellect. It is experiential. Only by experiencing Christ's path for ourselves can we learn of Him at the level necessary to prove ourselves and to receive His gift.<br><br>I love that Christ doesn't keep His learning objective hidden. He tells us quite plainly what we will be learning: "For I am meek and lowly in heart." This statement picks up and echoes the recurring theme that Christ taught His disciples when He said, "I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). Christ's path is a path of meekness and submission. We must learn to submit our wills to the Father's. If we follow Christ's path to the end, we won't just find rest, but we will "find rest unto [our] souls." This phrase echoes the numerous promises of eternal life that are found in the scriptures and that are given to all who choose to receive it.<br><br>I confess that the last verse--"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light"--has been wonderfully problematic for me, since I have experienced tribulation somewhat regularly along Christ's path of discipleship. You probably aren't like me, but I have been known to mutter under my breath, "I wonder if I can sue for false advertising. How is this easy and light?" Of course that is only when I am feeling a bit ornery. I fully believe that there is no deception in Christ, so I know He meant what He said. I just haven't fully understood it.<br><br>As I have pondered this phrase and tried to reconcile it with all of my experiences, I have come to see it in a new way. It seems that the previous verse holds the key. What if Christ's yoke is the Father's will? Plain. Simple. Easy. And what if we consider light as a noun instead of as an adjective? We don't often think of light as a burden; however, remember the scriptures that teach that where much is given much is required? Receiving light brings duty and responsibility. Some scriptural synonyms for light are truth, glory, and love.<br><br>When I read verse 30 in this way, it takes on a whole new meaning for me: "For my yoke is the Father's will, and my burden is light, truth, glory, and love."<br><br>Understanding this passage in this way has helped me more fully understand that when we yoke ourselves to Christ, we commit to do all things our Father commands us to do. When we <i>remain</i> yoked to Christ in times of prosperity and joy and in times of tribulation and suffering, we learn of Him and become like Him. We learn to divest ourselves of selfishness and replace it with selflessness--toobey as He obeyed and to love as He loved. By so doing we keep our second estate.<br><h2><b>The Example</b></h2><br>So how do we take Christ's yoke upon us? It is simple: we follow Him and strive to emulate Him. His perfect obedience to God's commandments, both universal and personal, illustrates not only a perfect love for our Father but also a perfect submission of His will to the Father's. Christ's example of submission is so perfect that we sometimes miss the truth that Christ actually had His own will. We see Christ's will, however, when He obeyed the Father's personal commandment to Him to bring about the Atonement. We see it in these words Christ prayed: "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). Here we clearly see Christ's will, which is separate from the Father's. We also clearly see His perfect and complete submission, for He accepted His burden and suffered in Gethsemane, during the illegal Sanhedrin trial, in Pilate's palace, and at Golgotha. He sacrificed His life even when the Father withdrew His Spirit and left Him alone.<br><br>There is another important lesson to be learned about tribulation from Luke's account of the Savior's submission in the Garden of Gethsemane. After Christ had committed himself to God's will to bring about the Atonement, we read the following: "And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him" (Luke 22:43).<br><br>I believe Christ's complete yielding allowed the Father to send this heavenly support. The purpose of such help was to strengthen Christ in carrying the burden placed upon Him by the Father, not to lift it from His shoulders. God's will for Christ was that He love and suffer and sacrifice and atone. The Father didn't remove this burden, nor did the angel. Christ carried this burden, the weight of which caused suffering we cannot understand. Luke explained, "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground" (Luke 22:44).<br><h2><b>Purposes of Tribulation</b></h2><br>Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but tribulation and suffering are part of the path of discipleship. Of course you have already figured this out. Prosperity and joy are also part of the path to balance the tribulation and suffering. Now, I am not suggesting that prosperity and joy and tribulation and suffering come in equal proportions. My experience suggests that the former far outweigh the latter; however, tribulation and suffering are part of the path.<br><br><i>How</i> we respond to our life conditions, whether in prosperity or tribulation, is what matters in mortality. Remember that life on earth is a proving ground, a trial. Our pattern of choices determines the degree of promised glory that we are willing to receive from our loving Father. Christ's path teaches us how to receive <i>all</i> of our heavenly parents' glory by teaching us how to be obedient in <i>all</i> things They command us to do here.<br><br>Here is what I have learned so far from my periods of tribulation and suffering. I have learned these things as I have learned to willingly submit my will to the Father's. When I have chosen to harden my heart, my tribulation hasn't sanctified me. For me, learning to submit in all things is a process. I am learning line upon line, precept upon precept, which is why tribulation ebbs and flows throughout our lives. I have learned three things I would like to share:<br><br>1. Experiencing tribulation reveals remnants of the natural man within me, and submitting my will cleanses and refines my soul of these remnants.<br><br>2. Experiencing tribulation reveals an essential dimension of God's burden of light, truth, and love, and submitting my will expands my capacity to receive the gifts of faith, hope, and charity.<br><br>3. Experiencing tribulation is a necessary condition under which we must prove ourselves faithful and obedient to God's will. We must prove ourselves in <i>all</i> things in order to receive <i>all</i> our heavenly parents' glory.<br><h2><b>Making Room for God</b></h2><br>A poem titled "Indwelling" by Thomas Edward Brown beautifully expresses our need to put off the natural man and eliminate selfishness so that we can put on the cloak of selflessness:<br><br><i>If thou couldst empty all thyself of self,</i><br><i>  Like to a shell dishabited,</i><br><i>Then might He find thee on the Ocean shelf,</i><br><i>  And say--"This is not dead,"--</i><br><i>And fill thee with Himself instead.</i><br><br><i>But thou art all replete with very </i><b><i>thou,</i></b><br><i>  And hast such shrewd activity,</i><br><i>That, when He comes, He says--"This is enow</i><br><i>  Unto itself--'Twere better let it be:</i><br><i>It is so small and full, there is no room for Me."</i><br>[<i>Old John and Other Poems </i>(London: Macmillan and Co., 1893), 151; emphasis in original]<br><br>When we obey God's commandments and diligently try to follow the doctrines of Christ, we put off large portions of the natural man; however, remnants still remain. These remnants are the parts of ourselves that are centered on self rather than being centered on others. Eliminating these remnants that are deeply embedded in our souls is not an easy task. Sometimes we don't even know certain aspects of the natural man still exist within us. Tribulation has a way of bringing to light the remnants of the natural man that still reside within us. Unlike the God in Thomas Brown's poem, who seems content to let us be small and full of self, our loving Father offers us tribulation to poke and prod us to empty ourselves of self so that we might be filled with His light instead.<br><br>I would like to share with you a few personal experiences that have taught me these things. I do so to illustrate in a concrete way that these principles are true and not just some theoretical or scriptural abstractions. By choosing my own experiences, I am taking a risk. Irun the risk of you mistakenly thinking that I am putting myself forward as an example to follow. I am not. Christ is our example. I also run the risk of you mistakenly thinking that Iam suggesting my tribulations are somehow unique and greater than anyone else's. I am not. I believe that everyone experiences tribulation and that these tribulations are individually tailored to fit each person's circumstances and needs, strengths and weaknesses. We are told that we "must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham" (D&amp;amp;C 101:4), but that doesn't mean we will be commanded to sacrifice our only son. I believe it means that we will all be tried as Abraham was--pushed beyond our limits in order to expand these limits. I acknowledge that the conditions that cause you tribulation and suffering will be different from those that cause me tribulation; however, if we follow Christ's path of meekness and submission, then our sanctification will be the same.<br><br>So I share my own experiences because they are what I know best, and sometimes the lessons we learn from suffering aren't easy to discern from the outside. In sharing my own experiences, I also bear testimony of the reality of God's promise to lead us by the hand and give us answers to our prayers (see D&amp;amp;C 112:10). I testify that the joy and happiness we receive in this life and in the next from walking Christ's path are far greater than we can imagine. I am grateful for God's guidance and love, and I acknowledge it in all its forms.<br><h2><b>Experiencing Tribulation</b></h2><br>In the early fall of 2000 my wife and I were prompted to pursue the adoption of a child from India. We already had two biological daughters and an adopted son, but we followed that prompting, and four and a half years later we were offered a three-month-old baby named Chetna, whose name means "awakening" or "bright intelligence."<br><br>Chetna had a rough start in life, spending six of her first twelve weeks in the hospital. Butshe was a fighter and survived to three months of age, which qualified her to be placed for adoption. At the time of our matching she had no known major disabilities. Among the many papers and forms we had to fill out during the adoption process was a three- to four-page form listing the conditions we were willing to assume in our adopted child. The list ranged from "perfectly normal" to "very severe disabilities." We had indicated "not accept" to all but a few of the mild disabilities. We were not Mother Teresa. We were approaching our forties and already had three kids. We weren't looking for a challenge.<br><br>As we considered the possibility of adopting Chetna, we pored over the two-inch thick medical file we had been sent. We consulted with our pediatrician. We studied it out in our minds, we prayed, and we decided to adopt Chetna. Then we went to the Provo Temple seeking confirmation of our decision. It came clearly and peacefully: "Yes, this is your child." We were overjoyed that we had found her at last. We called our social worker and told her our decision.<br><br>Four weeks later we were told that Chetna's primary caregiver at the orphanage in Calcutta was concerned that she wasn't responding to sound like she should. We were asked if her hearing could be tested again. We gave permission, and we received a call a few days later telling us that Chetna was profoundly deaf in her right ear and severely deaf in her left. Our social worker quickly assured us that we could reconsider our decision--that we hadn't agreed to this. What she didn't know was that since we had listed our answers on that form years earlier, we had changed. Among the many changes was that we had received a witness from the Holy Ghost in God's temple. We knew that adopting Chetna was part of God's personal plan for us. So without hesitation we told her, "There is no change in our decision. We accept this condition."<br><br>Six weeks after that we learned that Chetna was blind. This time the news came by letter instead of by phone. In the letter we were again told that we could reconsider our decision. When my then twelve-year-old daughter Elizabeth read this line, she asked what it meant. When I explained it to her, she said, with some fervor and indignation, "Well, we aren't going to do that!"<br><br>She was right. We wrote back and said, "There is no change in our decision. We accept this condition."<br><br>Later that night, after the kids were in bed, my wife and I held hands across our kitchen table and, with some fear and trepidation in our hearts, wondered aloud how we were going to do this. A deaf <i>and</i> blind child? We felt overwhelmed, but we put our trust in the Lord and moved forward.<br><br>When I learned that Chetna was blind, I was afraid. Blindness touched upon a deep-seated personal fear of mine. Gratefully there wasn't just fear in my heart--but there was also faith. Ibelieved Christ had given sight to the blind in New Testament times, and I believed He could do so today.<br><br>I started to pray daily and fast weekly that Chetna would be given her sight. I did this for five months. At first these prayers and my fasting were grounded in my own fears of blindness. Gradually they progressed to being grounded in my inability to parent a child with blindness and then to a concern for her life condition. Finally they became firmly grounded in the acknowledgment that God's will be done, regardless of the outcome.<br><br>There was a point between the third and fourth stages of my progression that I allowed doubt and anger into my life. Essentially, I let go of God's hand. During this period my prayers weren't prayers at all; they were demands couched in the trappings of prayer. Itreated God like a short-order cook at a roadside café who had gotten my order wrong.<br><br>Finally, after three weeks of walking in the light of my own sparks instead of in God's light (see Isaiah 50:11), I paused long enough for the Spirit to penetrate my mind with a ­single question: "Don't you trust me to take care of Chetna until she is in your care, to provide for her what I know she needs?" That quiet question brought me up short, and I came to myself (see Luke 15:17). My response to the Spirit's question moved me toward complete submission. It had taken nearly five months, but I was finally able to say with all my heart and without conditions or hidden reservations, "Thy will be done."<br><h2><b>Joy and Peace</b></h2><br>Fast-forward eleven years, for I have neither the time nor the capacity to tell you a hundredth part of our journey with Chetna, of its summits and valleys; however, I can tell you that people are drawn to her light. God's light and love shine through her eyes. She can see. It is a gift from God, who knew what we didn't.<br><br>When we brought Chetna home from the orphanage in Calcutta, we didn't know she wouldn't be able to move her fingers, hands, and arms to sign as a way of communicating, that she wouldn't be able to swallow sufficiently well to gain weight and thrive, that she wouldn't walk or talk, and that the only muscle groups she would be able to control at will are those that control her smile. In short, we didn't know that she would have quadriplegic cerebral palsy. We didn't know any of these things. All of these conditions would be revealed to us over time. But God knew, and in His infinite kindness He gave Chetna her sight and her smile so that she might have one avenue of communication with her world.<br><br>Now, many might think that Chetna's smile is the smile of someone mentally deficient, that she is unaware of her circumstances and therefore incapable of true and meaningful choice. They would be wrong. Chetna is whole in mind and soul. It is her body that is afflicted. She chooses her responses to her ­conditions and tribulation just as freely as you and I choose ours. Through her pattern of choices Chetna has become my greatest teacher of how to bear my burdens with greater grace and patience. She teaches me how to suffer long, to be kind, to bear all things, and to endure all things (see Moroni 7:45). Thus, when she smiles, the light she is carrying emanates from her soul. She reassures me that God is real and that all is well because we have His love.<br><h2><b>Stay the Course</b></h2><br>The purpose of our tribulation is not to experience crushing, hopeless despair. The fruit of our suffering can be a bright hope. Remaining steadfast in Christ through our afflictions and adversity increases our capacity to see our promised end more clearly. Like a powerful spotlight that shines more brightly in complete darkness, our suffering reveals Christ to us. We see His promise of salvation, resurrection, and eternal life more clearly in our mind's eye, and we look forward with a bright hope to that perfect day, seeing it afar off but knowing that it lies ahead (see Hebrews 11:13).<br><br>Do I believe I am finished? No--just ask anyone who knows me. I am not a finished product; I have "miles to go before I sleep" (Robert Frost, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" [1923]). Will my path again become steep and rocky and painful? Certainly, but Ido not fear what lies ahead. I know in whom Ihave trusted. He has shown me how to carry on when darkness surrounds me.<br><br>And what about you? What will you do when you experience tribulation? If it is tribulation that comes from putting off Christ's yoke and leaving His path, then I encourage you to repent and return. But what if it is tribulation you experience along Christ's path? What will you do when you come to your Gethsemane? For Gethsemane moments are bound to come to those who take Christ's yoke upon them and follow His path of discipleship. I encourage you to choose a battle cry of commitment. There are many to choose from:<br><br><i>Choose you this day whom ye will serve; ... but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. </i>[Joshua 24:15]<br><br><i> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. </i>[Hebrews 10:35]<br><br><i>Shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, ... and on, on to the victory! </i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:22]<br><br><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i><br><br><i> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i> [Proverbs 3:5–6]<br><br>I testify that if we will repent, our chastenings will cleanse our souls of sin. If we submit with meekness to God's will, our afflictions will refine us and expand our capacity to receive and carry more light and truth and love. So stay the course! I encourage you not as a bystander on the sidelines watching you run, nor as a finisher who has completed the race, but as a fellow runner who is running the race with you.<br><br>Remember this promise from the Lord as you experience tribulation and suffering; it applies to all who submit to God's will:<br><br><i>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. </i>[Isaiah 40:31]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sterling C.

<h1> Use You, God Will Bless You - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be with you today. I love this university for many reasons--not the least of these is the fact that I attended school here, as did my wife, our five children, and four of five of their spouses. I suppose you could say that I have a personal, financial investment in this university.<br><br>I love that so many wonderful, intelligent disciples of the Savior come to this campus to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of truth and to seek temporal and spiritual knowledge.<br><br>I have already said that I love this university. What I didn't tell you was that I also carry fond feelings for this building in which we are seated today.<br><br>As I was watching students enter the building this morning, it brought back a flood of memories. For a moment it seemed as though time had rolled back, and I could see myself as a student your age, entering this verybuilding.<br><br>However, in my case, the reason I most often entered this building was to work the midnight cleanup shift here at the Marriott Activities Center. If you look around, you will see the very places I walked with broom and mop, tidying up after devotionals, basketball games, and special events. So for those of you who might be tempted to litter while you are here, please keep in mind that I will be watching.<br><br>This campus is sacred. While I worked and studied here, I also pondered questions that many of you might be asking atthis time of your life:<br><br>• What should I study?<br><br>• What will become of me?<br><br>• Does the Lord care which career I choose?<br><br>• Will I ever meet someone, fall in love, and get married?<br><br>• Will I find happiness and success in life?<br><br>I have to tell you that these questions felt all consuming and even frightening at times. I honestly didn't know exactly where my life would go when I was your age. One thing is certain: I never imagined as I was sweeping this great hall that one day I would be at this pulpit speaking to you.<br><br>Today I want to address two of the questions you might be asking--things I myself desperately wanted to know when I was yourage.<br><br>First, if you dedicate your life to God's ­service, will He direct your steps and use youfor His righteous purposes?<br><br>Second, if you choose to follow the Savior and walk in the path of discipleship, will the Lord watch over you, guide you, bless you, and fill you with a spirit of joy and fulfillment?<br><h2><b>A Temple in Philadelphia</b></h2><br>In the ten years prior to my being called to the Presiding Bishopric, I had the blessing and privilege of helping to identify and acquire sites for temples.<br><br>A few years ago President Thomas S. Monson announced that there would be a ­temple in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so we went to work researching possible sites where that temple could be built. Two sites ultimately emerged--and it just so happened that they were across the street from each other.<br><br>With the approval of the First Presidency, and after doing some preliminary due diligence, we began the process of acquiring the properties. To my great surprise, the owner of the first site accepted our offer without negotiation. I can't tell you how remarkable this was!<br><br>It has been my experience that when a property owner discovers that the interested party is the Church, the price often goes up. To put this in perspective, the owner of the second property across the street responded with a price that was more than four times the price we offered.<br><br>When I met with the owner of the first property, he explained that he had owned the property for almost twenty-five years and could have developed it several times. But he had always felt that the property had a "higher and better purpose." When we offered to buy it, he said it felt right.<br><br>However, you probably already know that when it comes to building the kingdom of God--and especially when it comes to building temples--things often don't go as smoothly as we would hope.<br><br>Shortly after we filed the paperwork, the city of Philadelphia, through a city-controlled agency, filed a legal claim that stopped the transaction. They wanted to take title to the property themselves. This was a very serious matter. We did everything we could to meet with the agency and remove the claim. We were unsuccessful. This was a real problem and was very discouraging. We had felt so good about the property. We believed that this was the place where the Lord wanted His temple tobe built.<br><br>As a final step we took our appeal of last resort to the mayor. He was the only one with the authority to change the situation.<br><br>With a heavy heart I flew to Philadelphia with the Church temple architect. There we were joined by an Area Seventy and two local Church members. One of these members was someone you may have heard of. He, too, attended this university. In fact, he played on the BYU football team and eventually ended up playing professional football for the Philadelphia Eagles.<br><br>Vai Sikahema is a well-known local ­celebrity in Philadelphia. He had completed asuccessful career playing football and afterward became a sports announcer on a local tele­vision station.<br><br>Before the meeting with the mayor, our little group of five met together and talked about the purpose for the meeting. Then we knelt in prayer. We knew that we would desperately need the Lord's blessing that day.<br><br>At the meeting, the mayor, a city council member, and some of the mayor's staff were in attendance. After introductions, my heart sank as I realized the atmosphere in the room was more than a little cold. It appeared evident that the decision had already been made, that the hearts of the city officials had been set against our building a temple there, and that this meeting was little more than a formality.<br><br>As we started to explain the project, the mayor explained that his staff had assured him this property was better suited for commercial purposes--an office building or a hotel would not only benefit the city with jobs but would provide needed tax revenue. We would need tolook for another site.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I have been in situations where all appears lost, where it seems that nothing you can do or say will make a difference. What I have learned in these situations is that if you are on the Lord's errand, do all that you can do with the talents and abilities God has given you and then lift up your heart and plead for God to hear your prayer and intervene on your behalf. Even though you may appear to be outnumbered, even though it appears that all may be lost, our beloved Father in Heaven will reach out and take you by the hand. He will fight your battles. He will come to your aid.<br><br>I know that the five members of the Church in that room were pleading in our hearts for heavenly help. What could we say or do that would help change the mayor's heart and mind?<br><br>I asked the mayor if the architect could show a simple drawing or two of how the temple might look. He looked at his watch--asign that he wanted the meeting to end--and said, "Okay."<br><br>But before the architect could begin, Brother Sikahema asked the mayor if he could say something.<br><br>The mayor was acquainted with Brother Sikahema and said, "Of course."<br><br>Vai paused for a moment and then stood. In a humble voice he went on to say something like this:<br><br>"Mr. Mayor, many years ago when I was a young boy in Tonga, my father and mother and my brothers and sisters sold our home, we sold fruits and vegetables, and we sold everything we could to have enough money to travel to Hamilton, New Zealand, to be sealed as an eternal family in the temple. You need this temple. This temple will bless your city. This temple will bless your community. It will bless the people."<br><br>Then he sat down. We were all very quiet.<br><br>After a moment the Church architect stood and showed the mayor a few drawings of what a temple might look like. It was clear that in those few minutes something had changed. Inreality, everything had changed.<br><br>As the architect sat down, the nonmember city councilman asked to speak. He stood and said, "Mr. Mayor, I have spoken with the leaders in the community and neighbors of this property. We want this temple. We need this temple. It will bless our city. It will bless our community. It will bless the people."<br><br>As he spoke, you could feel the Spirit come into the meeting. It was a sacred moment. What was to have been a thirty-minute meeting lasted for the better part of an hour and a half. Oh, how different things were after that sublime moment!<br><br>To my surprise, at the end of this public meeting the mayor turned and asked if I would offer a prayer in that setting. His heart had changed. The temple would go forward. Itwould be built on the selected site.<br><br>Now brothers and sisters, I have a special blessing for us today that is not always possible. I would like you to meet Brother Vai Sikahema, who is with us this morning. He is not just a football player and he is not just a stake president. He is an instrument in the hands of the Lord.<br><br>My dear friends, the Lord knows the end from the beginning. He knew that a young football player at Brigham Young University would one day need to be present in a meeting with city officials at the moment when a site for His temple would be discussed. He knew that Vai Sikahema's humble testimony would need to be shared--that it would be the turning point that made the difference at a critical time.<br><br>Heavenly Father knew Brother Sikahema, and He prepared him and put him in the appointed place so that his humble testimony would be shared and his faith and testimony would help further the Lord's work among men.<br><h2><b>God Will Use You</b></h2><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, God used Brother Sikahema. He will use you. If you give your hearts to Him and strive to walk in faith and compassion on the path the Savior commanded, He will use you. He will use you in ways you cannot now imagine.<br><br>"But," you might say, "I'm no one special. I'm not a football player. I'm not a celebrity. I'm nobody. I'm average in every way. I'm not particularly smart, eloquent, coordinated, well dressed, or even well behaved. How could God use me?"<br><br>Don't you know that since the beginning oftime our Heavenly Father has reached out tothose who were average and used them for His purposes?<br><br>The Apostle Paul wrote to you today as he did to the ancient Corinthians:<br><br><i>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</i><br><br><i>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</i><br><br><i>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</i><br><br><i>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Gideon was a farmer, but God saw him as the man who would deliver Israel from bondage.<br><br>When Samuel stood before the people to present to them their new young King Saul, the Bible tells us that Saul was so terrified that he "hid himself among the stuff."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Even though Esther was an orphan and acaptive in a strange land, she saved her people from execution. Even today the Jews celebrate the Feast of Purim to commemorate her courage.<br><br>When it came time for our Savior to restore His Church to the earth, whom did He choose? There were many refined, educated, well-dressed, well-spoken people on the earth at that time. But our Savior chose a rough, humble boy--a farmer, a youth with very little formal schooling.<br><br>Why does the Lord choose the weak things of the world for His purposes? Why does God choose the "base things of the world, and things which are despised"? Paul answered his own question: "That no flesh should glory in his presence."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Why do you suppose God told Gideon to keep sending his troops home until he only had three hundred men to face more than one hundred thousand of the enemy?<br><br>Why do you think our Savior chose a fisherman to be His chief apostle who would lead the Church after He was gone?<br><br>Why do you suppose God chose an ­untutored farm boy to translate the Book ofMormon?<br><br>First, because God doesn't look on our ­countenance or the height of our stature:<br><br><i>The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh onthe outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Second, because God is able to take the mosthumble clay and create of it a masterpiece. Truly, "if God be for us, who can be against us?"<sup>5</sup><br><br>Third, God chooses the average and the weak so that no man can boast and say, "I have done this out of my own ability." He uses ordinary "earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."<sup>6</sup><br><br>When an army of a hundred thousand is routed by a band of three hundred, people give praise to God.<br><br>When a humble fisherman takes a small group of believers and shepherds them into a mighty Church, people lift up their voices and give thanks to God.<br><br>When a frontier boy leaves the plow and translates the most inspiring and life-changing text since the Bible, people glory not in the intellect of man but in the power of God.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father doesn't need you to be mighty, intelligent, well dressed, well-spoken, or well inherited. He needs you to incline your hearts to Him and seek to honor Him by serving Him and reaching out in compassion to those around you.<br><br>I bear my personal witness that if God can use a humble janitor who spent many hours mopping and buffing the floors of the Marriott Center, He can certainly use you.<br><h2><b>A Temple in San Salvador</b></h2><br>The second thing I want to impress upon you today is that if you will follow Him in truth and might, He will bless you in ways you cannot comprehend.<br><br>In 2006 President Hinckley and the First Presidency determined that there should be a temple considered for San Salvador in ElSalvador. This was due to many reasons, not the least of which was that our beloved Church members who were traveling from El Salvador to the Guatemala City Temple were having difficulties in the travel, including armed robberies.<br><br>We spent many days searching for appropriate temple sites, but none seemed right. I visited a number of properties, including a full city block (eight acres) located in the older central part of the city. As I drove from property to property, nothing seemed right.<br><br>Eventually I passed by an emerging area in the west part of the city. I felt something in that area and walked around a number of blocks. One property surrounded by a wall was of particular interest. I reached out to the owners through the real estate agent and received word that the property was not available. I returned home.<br><br>But the prophet had said a temple would be built in San Salvador, so I returned once again to look at other properties. None of them seemed right for the temple of God. Once again I found myself drawn to the property with the wall, and I made contact again. Once again they repeated that the property was unavailable. It was their historic ancestral homesite, and it was not for sale.<br><br>I returned home again but couldn't shake the feeling that this was where the temple should be. I reached out and contacted the family and asked if they would at least meet with me. They agreed to do so. Once again I traveled to San Salvador, accompanied by Robert Fox, a friend and employee in the real estate division. That morning we knelt in prayer in my room before beginning the day and asked for the Lord's assistance.<br><br>We arrived at the home for the meeting with the Dueñas family. As we drove through the gate it was almost like entering into a sacred garden. There were trees and flowers, and the busy noise from outside stopped at the gate. We parked, and Mr. Roberto Dueñas, his brother, and two of Roberto's sons were awaiting us. They greeted us and then escorted us into their ancestral home--which was quite large and spacious.<br><br>We told them we were there by assignment of the Church president--President GordonB. Hinckley--and that he wanted to bless the country and Church members by building a temple there. I showed pictures of other temples. I said that we felt their property, their ancestral home, was the right place.<br><br>It was no surprise when they once again declined. But we had to make the attempt. And so for almost one hour we tried every avenue of approach, such as a straight outright purchase, an exchange of property, and every other option we could think of. But they were firm in their resolve and said no at every offer. Once again every door seemed closed.<br><br>I had done everything I could do. I had prepared. I had done the best I knew how. But it simply was not enough.<br><br>My heart was filled with an urgent prayer: "Father, please help us to know what to say or do." But we could make no progress.<br><br>At last it became evident that our trip had been in vain. It appeared that nothing would change their minds. As we began to prepare to leave, something happened. You could feel the Spirit of the Lord enter the room. It was tangible. Everyone in the room felt it.<br><br>Roberto Dueñas, who was not a member of the Church, began to cry. Tears cascaded down his cheeks. It was one of the most powerful spiritual experiences I have ever felt. Finally, Mr. Dueñas turned to his brother and said, "If we can't sell our ancestral home, couldn't we sell the very best of the property we have across the street?"<br><br>His brother responded affirmatively.<br><br>We then talked about the other property. They owned several hundred acres across the main road from their ancestral home, with the heart of the property jutting out slightly so that every car that traveled this road would see the temple.<br><br>That was the property they offered for the temple of the Lord. It truly was a miracle.<br><br>From that moment forward, the blessings ofthe Lord attended the process. We acquired the property, and on August 21, 2011, President Henry B. Eyring dedicated it to the Lord's service.<br><br>I testify that this beautiful temple graces thebeautiful hills of El Salvador not as a result of anything Brother Fox or I said or did. That temple stands there today because of the unspeakable blessings and powerful ministerings of the Holy Spirit of our Almighty God.<br><h2><b>Our Merciful Father</b></h2><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, if the Lord cares enough to send His Spirit and make available a site for a temple, do you not suppose that He will send His Spirit and prepare your heart and guide your steps not only this day but throughout the rest of your life and for the remainder of eternity?<br><br>You are inexpressibly more precious to your Father in Heaven than a plot of land. You are a beloved child of your Eternal Father. You are the offspring of the God of the Universe!<br><br>Do you not suppose that He is mindful of you? Do you not suppose that He will use you and bless you in ways more glorious than are possible for you to imagine?<br><br>The scriptures tell us that if we "trust in the Lord with all [our] heart; and lean not unto [our] own understanding," if in all our ways we "acknowledge him, ... he shall direct [our] paths."<sup>7</sup><br><br>The great King Benjamin perfectly summarized the message I wish to leave with you today. Will you listen to his words as though he were here before you today?<br><br>He said:<br><br><i>I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>I raise my voice in praise of and witness to this truth. I testify with all the tenderness of my heart that I have seen the promised blessings of God fulfilled over and over and over again in my own life and in the lives of many others.<br><br>I promise you that if you will but incline your hearts to your Father in Heaven, if you willstrive each day to love and follow Him more perfectly, if you will in compassion and kindness share the burdens and lift up the hands of those who are struggling around you, then the Lord God of heaven will direct your paths. He will use you for His sublime purposes. He will bless you in ways you cannot imagine.<br><br>How grateful I am to our merciful Father, who knows us, who loves us, and who desires that we become the magnificent beings of grace and light we were designed to become. I pray that you will capture this vision and know within your hearts that if you seek to become true disciples of our beloved Savior, the Lord will use you. He will bless you.

<h1>ace I Leave with You&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am humbled by the opportunity to speak with you today. Iwould like to give special thanks to the members of my family, to my colleagues, and to my students who are in attendance. It doesn't seem that long ago that I was a student here at BYU attending devotionals and forums. I am glad to be part of this tradition as a speaker now; this campus community is a precious one, especially as we have opportunities to come together and discuss matters of the gospel.<br><h2><b>The Peace of Christ</b></h2><br>I would like to tell you about an experience I had as a student. I was learning French, and Irealized that in order to progress in my studies I needed to immerse myself in the language. So I applied for an internship and went to work as a nanny for a wonderful French-speaking family in Belgium. For the first several weeks I traveled with the family in France. As I had hoped, my language skills were improving daily--being corrected by a two-year-old was highly motivating.<br><br>Eventually, when we arrived back at the family's home near Brussels, I had Sundays free, so I could attend church. My hosts were kind enough to help me determine which trains and trams I would take to get to the nearest chapel, and the next Sunday I ventured into Brussels on my own. After taking the train into the heart of the city and making various connections, I began walking through the busy city streets. Brussels is a beautiful and vibrant city. I came to love it. On this first trip through the city, however, I began to feel overwhelmed, a bit lost, and very much alone. In fact, the stresses of the last several weeks started to weigh heavy--the difficulties of constantly communicating in another language, of fitting into another family's routines, and of adjusting to a new employer's expectations. Lost, alone, and overwhelmed, I said a silent prayer and walked on.<br><br>Finally I turned a corner and caught sight of a bright white row building with "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" in French posted on the front. It is hard to describe exactly what happened at that moment, but what I <i>can</i> say is that the sight of that sign brought peace to my soul. Yes, I was relieved to have found the church building, but it was something more than that. The oppressive weight I had been feeling was lifted. I felt like I could go on. I smiled the biggest smile I had had on my face for quite some time and marched right into that building to enjoy one of the most powerful testimony meetings I have ever experienced.<br><br>When I think back on this time, I am reminded of what has become my favorite scripture. In John 14:27 we read:<br><br><i> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i><br><br><i> </i>Christ spoke these words to His apostles as He was preparing them for His death. He had taught them that a Comforter would come in His place so that they could continue to receive direction and solace. He had taught them about the Resurrection, about carrying on His work, and about how they could be unified with Him and the Father. Yet apparently He knew that in spite of all they had learned and all they had experienced with Him, the next segment of their lives was going to tax their faith and patience and confidence. He knew that one would betray Him, that another would deny Him, that many would feel shame, and that all of them would suffer and worry and not fully comprehend the monumental events that were occurring.<br><br>In the midst of what He knew would seem to be a world in turmoil, He offered them peace. His type of peace would not mean the absence of military action or civil unrest. Instead, Christ's peace resides in one's heart. It is a spiritual peace that quells fear and anxiety. In the midst of the adversity that He knew His apostles would face, He wanted to bless them with consolation, confidence, and a conviction that all would be right in the end.<br><br>I imagine that there is not one soul on this earth who has not experienced adversity, who has not felt alone and troubled and afraid. Christ's gift to His apostles is certainly as available to us as it was to them. I know that His peace descended upon my heart in the middle of the busy streets of Brussels. "My peace I give unto you," He says to each of us.<br><br>So how do we find this peace in the midst ofour busy lives--while studying for midterms, writing research papers, and negotiating social relationships? Especially, how do we find it during the times when life is at its hardest, when the fear and anxiety and anguish of human existence feels like it may well ­overcome us?<br><br>Christ taught that understanding His role in this world is key to feeling His peace. "Be of good cheer," He said. "I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>One image that comes to mind when I think of understanding the Lord's role comes from Isaiah 64: "But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand" (verse 8). Like a potter shaping clay into a beautiful vase, the Lord created us in the beginning, and He will continue to shape us now. Indeed, a great deal of peace comes with understanding this. He knows, for example, how to help us deal with the consequences of sin in order to make us whole and perfect. He knows how to aid us in responding to such things as catastrophic illness, nonsensical violence, or perceived failure.<br><br>That said, <i>we</i> have a role to play in this process too. We are the living dust into which He breathed the breath of life, and He expects us to take part in our own shaping. To do this, we cultivate a sensitivity to the Lord's promptings. As the psalmist wrote, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me" (Psalm 51:10). We need our hearts and our spirits to be in line with the Lord's will in order to truly feel His peace.<br><br>I wish this were an easy process. I wish it were simple to feel secure, confident, and calm when encountering the bumps in life that can throw us off track. At times I think I have managed to tap into Christ's peace and assurance at these points; at other times I think I haven't done so well. Perhaps you have experienced this too. I do find that watching how others deal with these situations teaches me a lot, whether those examples are in the lives of those around me, in the scriptures, or in the other books I read.<br><h2><b>A Literary Lesson in Finding Peace</b></h2><br>In my work as an English professor I have the pleasure of reading a lot of really good books. Many times my reading of these books goes beyond aesthetic appreciation or professional interest, and I find insights that truly enrich my understanding of life. Reading literary fiction can be a profoundly ethical exercise in learning to see the world from another's point of view. I had this experience several years ago when I first encountered the work of a Victorian author named Charlotte Yonge.<br><br>Charlotte Mary Yonge was born in 1823 in a village in the south of England. She was part of an upper-middle-class family and was the eldest of two children. Yonge's work was very popular during her day; indeed, in Louisa May Alcott's <i>Little Women,</i> when Jo hides in her attic space to read, she is devouring Yonge's first best seller, titled <i>The Heir of Redclyffe. </i>In spite ofher fame, Yonge lived out her life in the same village where she was born, ­teaching in the local Sunday School, nursing both her ­parents until their deaths, and honing her skills as an author.<br><br>It is interesting to note that while Yonge was living a seemingly staid life in a secure and well-established community, the early Latter-day Saints were bringing forth the Restoration as they moved from Ohio to Missouri to Illinois and eventually to Utah. Charlotte Yonge, however, was a figure in a religious revolution of a different sort. She and her family were part of a reform effort within the Anglican Church called the Oxford Movement. Yonge saw her published work as part of this movement; she considered herself "a sort of instrument for popularising Church views," asshe put it.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Yonge thought deeply and seriously about religious matters. Though she rarely allowed overt questions of doctrine to intrude on her fiction, her novels engage with Christian principles in original and compelling ways. One of Yonge's favorite techniques was to write what she termed "family chronicles"--long novels about very large families. In her works, families are where Christian principles are learned and tested. When speaking of her novels, C.S.Lewis commented, "Yonge makes it abundantly clear that ­domesticity is no passport to heaven on earth but an arduous vocation--a sea full of hidden rocks and perilous ice shores only to be navigated by one who uses a celestial chart."<sup>2</sup> Lewis was right: family life in Yonge's novels is "an ­arduous vocation" that allows her characters to grow, stumble, move on, and then begin the processagain.<br><br>One of her novels that best illustrates this process is titled <i>The Pillars of the House</i>.<sup>3</sup> It ­narrates the adventures of a family with ­<i>thirteen</i> children. Their father is a poor clergy­man working as a curate to help oversee a ­parish in the Anglican Church. They are a complex and lively family whose members have their share of joy, laughter, and comfort in one another as well as their share of the ­conflicts, petty betrayals, and estrangements that any group of humans encounters when they interact on a daily basis. In other words, this family behaves as a typical family does.<br><br>That is, until their father contracts tuberculosis from a poor man he helped to nurse, suffers for years, and dies the day that his wife delivers her last two children--twins. Their mother passes away three years later, having never recovered from complications due to falling down the stairs while she was pregnant. The thirteen children are left to fend for themselves, and this is where the real plot of the novel begins.<br><br>Yonge's novel narrates the children's ­predicament and the means they take to ­survive. Underlying this narrative is a prolonged contemplation on what it means to live a peaceful life in the midst of nearly unimaginable adversity. One of the characters in the book whose life demonstrates this struggle most clearly is the eldest child of the family, ayoung man who takes it upon himself to oversee and support his siblings when he is only sixteen years old.<br><br>His name is Felix. Felix is not living the life his parents had envisioned for him. Both his father and his mother began life in relative ease. His father attended university and was groomed to take a position as a clergyman on the family estate. He married and had his first few children during this period. Soon enough, however, a legal complication meant that he lost any prospect of working on or inheriting the estate, and he had to take a low-paying job in a parish far away.<br><br>The ramifications of this scenario for Felix are great. He was to be the eldest son of a substantial clergyman, sure to have the chance for advanced education and a prosperous career. Instead, Felix chooses to leave his local school before he even has a chance to compete for a scholarship to university. He takes a job at the local newspaper office and stationery store, curtails his hopes of doing anything else, and focuses on doing what he can for his family.<br><br>One can easily imagine Felix becoming overwhelmed with his responsibilities, fearful about what the future might hold and embittered about his position in life. Indeed, he struggles with all of these reactions. And he is not the only one. Upon learning about Felix's decision to leave school, his brother Edgar, a young teenager with great talent as an artist, grabs a half-burnt stick and takes out his indignation on the whitewashed wall of his bedroom by covering it with a charcoal sketch of the Greek hero Achilles as he shouted down the Trojan army. In this battle, Achilles's comrade, Patroclus, had just been killed, and Achilles was furious. Yonge described the scene in a storybook she wrote for children:<br><br><i>The Trojans came thicker and more furiously on them, and were almost bursting in, when Achilles, hearing the noise, came out, and, standing on the rampart just as he was, all unarmed, gave a terrible thundering shout, at which the Trojans were filled with dismay, and fled back in confusion.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Edgar explains to his sister, "If I were but older--I know I could--I'd save Felix from this horrible thing! I feel to want to roar"<sup>5</sup> just like Achilles! Edgar's impassioned and heartfelt despair and frustration at his own powerlessness is certainly understandable.<br><br>Have you ever felt like Edgar? Have you ever wanted to simply shout down the trials in your life--to put them to rest through your sheer might? I certainly have. Confronting our troubles is a good strategy, though trying to overcome them through our own might is bound to end in more frustration. Sure enough, anxiety and fear--the opposites of Christ's peace--­master Edgar time and again in the novel.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Felix himself, though, chooses a different way of confronting his situation. Felix often makes difficult choices that align his will with what he understands of the Lord's will for him. He certainly experiences as much emotional turmoil as Edgar, but he also manages to find some peace in the midst of adversity. Take, for example, one of the few recreations Felix allows himself after he assumes responsibility for providing for his family: he continues to sing in the church choir. The choir is an integral part of nearly every Anglican observance, so this is a drain on Felix's very limited time. In spite of this, he never seems to consider letting this commitment go. Even after sorting through a particularly difficult domestic conflict during the Christmas holidays, Felix hurries to be on time to the holiday service. That night, Yonge explains, Felix found himself "singing, as he had never sung before,--'Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.'"<sup>7</sup><br><br>What Felix seems to find in religious observance, particularly in musical observance, is a sense of reverence, a sense of a presence larger than himself that can put his own troubles into perspective. This is a conviction that Edgar lacks.<br><br>Paul Woodruff, a professor of humanities at the University of Texas at Austin, expressed the importance of reverence:<br><br><i> Reverence begins in a deep understanding of human limitations; from this grows the capacity to be in awe of whatever we believe lies outside our control--God, truth, justice, nature, even death. The capacity for awe, as it grows, brings with it the capacity for respecting fellow human beings, flaws and all.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Likewise, Felix's ability to feel awe anchors him. It allows him to accept his own and ­others' human limitations, the limitations that Edgar so resents. It allows him to reconcile himself to the idea of a Maker who continues to shape and direct events and to trust that Maker after he has done all he can. Reverence brings Felix peace.<br><br>Reverence also gives Felix humility to ­persevere in the efforts that he knows are essential for the well-being of his family. And Felix is given some profound lessons in humility. A few of these lessons come from his brother Fulbert, who is by turns rowdy and sullen. Fulbert is young--just ten when his father dies--and Yonge deftly portrays the way that Fulbert translates his grief into marked resentment of his elder brother's newfound authority. Fulbert knows exactly how to provoke Felix; it is as though all Felix's patience and long-suffering evaporate when Fulbert spitefully wastes the precious food prepared for dinner, wreaks havoc in the town streets, orgambles.<br><br>What is Felix to do when his best efforts fail? Felix humbles himself. He restrains his anger, attempts to see the situation from Fulbert's point of view, and does what he can to lead without imposing authority. In essence, he follows Christ's admonition in the Sermon on the Mount: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9). He does his best to make peace with Fulbert. In doing so, he implements the counsel on leadership that the Lord gave to Joseph Smith--to lead "by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41). Eventually this has an effect.<br><br>Another brother, Theodore, has an entirely different set of needs. Theo, as his family calls him, is one of the twins born the day their father died. He is mentally disabled, unable to communicate beyond cheerful sounds when he is content and moans when he is not. Over the years a close and caring relationship develops between Theo and Felix. Theo is rarely more content than when he is in Felix's company, so Felix keeps him close whenever possible. Felix even incorporates Theo into the church choir, not to sing the words but to vocalize the melody. On a daily basis Felix serves Theo, and their bond becomes stronger and stronger as time passes.<br><br>One way of understanding this bond is to see it in the context of Christ's teachings about charity. As we learn in 1 Corinthians 13:4, "Charity suffereth long, and is kind," and as Moroni wrote, "Charity is the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47). The daily sacrifices that Felix makes for Theo forge this type of love.<br><br>As both Felix and Theo come to adulthood, this love is put to the test. One day several members of the family enjoy a picnic and a boat ride down a nearby river. They are laughing and singing, as well as enduring a little family squabbling, when another boat comes suddenly around a corner, colliding with them violently so that both boats capsize. Felix is so attuned to caring for Theo that by reflex he dives to get hold of the full-grown Theo in the deep water and tows him to shore, using nothing short of superhuman strength to pull the two of them up the steep embankment and over the iron guardrail before he returns to help in the rescue of the others. Felix's sincere and selfless love for his brother trumps any concern for his own welfare, for in the midst of this rescue Felix sustains an injury that will eventually take his life.<br><br>Several months later, having realized that his wound will never fully heal, Felix looks back on this experience and on the responsibilities he had undertaken nearly two decades earlier. He remarks to a family friend who has been a true mentor through the years, "I have had my full share of happiness. A most happy, peaceful family."<sup>9</sup> Looking at what Felix has endured, peace and happiness do not seem to be the hallmarks of his life. Yet for Felix, charity, patience, peacemaking, humility, and reverence have all combined to shape him into a person who is capable of enduring adversity while retaining the peace that Christ offers to us all. The Lord is indeed the potter for a person like Felix. Felix exemplifies the words attributed to Thomas à Kempis, a fifteenth-century theologian: "There is no other way to life and to real inner peace except the way of the Cross and daily self-denial."<sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>Happiness Through the Atonement</b></h2><br>In her depiction of Felix, Yonge sets a pattern for us to follow. In fact, she incorporates aspects of this idea into Felix's very name. Iimagine Harry Potter fans in this audience already know the common meaning of the name Felix.<sup>11</sup> Indeed, we know that Charlotte Yonge herself was aware of the name's meaning and associations.<sup>12</sup> <i>Felix</i> means "happy" in Latin, and the name is associated with good fortune.<br><br>Yet this hardly seems appropriate for the character Felix in the novel. He is anything but fortunate. Did Yonge mean Felix's name to be ironic? I think not. I think Yonge meant us to reconsider our definitions of happiness and good fortune.<br><br>Felix's last name starts us thinking in this manner. The family name comes from the motto on its crest, "Under Wode, Under Rode." According to their father, this phrase incorporates Old English terms for tree or wood (<i>wudu</i> and <i>wuda</i>) and cross (<i>ród </i>or <i>rood</i>).<sup>13</sup> "Under Wode" has given the family its name: Underwood. Their name acknowledges that they labor under the burdens of this earthly existence, but it also acknowledges that Christ's Atonement lightens their load. The cross that is on their family crest is called a cross potent, or crutch cross. Each of its four T-shaped arms resembles a crutch. The idea is that the cross, or the Atonement, becomes a symbolic crutch, an aid to weary pilgrims completing their earthly journey. Before he dies, their father comments on the family crest:<br><br><i>"Under wood, under rood," he repeated. "It was once but sing-song to me. Now what a sermon! The load is the Cross. Bear thy cross, and thy cross will bear thee.</i> ..<i>. Rod and Rood, Cross and Crutch--all the same etymologically and veritably."</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>I believe that Yonge wants us all to see ourselves as Felix Underwood--happy souls who are fortunate to lean upon the Lord as we make our way through this life. As we imaginatively step into Felix's life, we learn that cultivating virtues such as reverence, patience, humility, and charity allows us to lean upon the Lord. These attributes help us to pattern our lives upon that of our Redeemer and prepare us to access the peace that He promised toHis disciples.<br><br>This peace rarely comes as a great and emphatic epiphany. Instead, peace suffuses our lives when we make the daily effort to invite it. When we pause, say a prayer, and invite the Lord in, He will send His peace. I know this. Iknow that even imperfect efforts to be charitable, humble, and long-suffering invite the Lord into our lives.<br><br>Christ's peace does not eliminate adversity; it does give us the courage and the confidence to carry on. It is as the Lord promised His ­disciples, and as He promises us all:<br><br><i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid</i>.

<br>
<br>
Today I would like to talk about some of the big issues of our time through the lens of history and literature as well as the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We live in a day of technological and scientific marvels. It is also a time of uncertainty--one in which many ­question whether or not faith and religion have a place in their lives or in the public square. You too will have to decide whether faith has an enduring place in your own life.<br><br>In fact, there are dramatic changes occurring within this country as it relates to faith and religion. A recent Pew Research Center study reported a dramatic decline in the share of the U.S. population that identifies as Christian. From 2007 to 2014--in just seven years--it fell by an extraordinary 8 percent.<sup>1</sup> While the drop is occurring across the board, it is especially pronounced among young adults. The world today poses many threats to faith in God, and the unfortunate fact is that faith in God is waning.<br><br>This is not the first time in history that such a crisis of faith has loomed. There was a similar period around 100 years ago. As the twentieth century opened, the world held great hope and enthusiasm for the future. Science was supplying astounding breakthroughs at every turn and the world seemed to be rushing toward a modern period when mankind, through its own self-generated progress and technology, might finally be able to solve the ancient problems of our world.<br><br>Consider some of the varied discoveries and inventions in just the first decade of the twentieth century. The modern escalator was invented--perhaps a kind of metaphor of man's supposedly inevitable rise. Marconi sent the first transatlantic radio signal. The vacuum cleaner and the tractor were developed--­harbingers of liberation from more arduous forms of labor. The Wright brothers flew the first manned flight. Albert Einstein stunned the world with his theory of relativity. Henry Ford produced more than 10,000 cars on the first assembly line of its kind. The world saw its first talking motion picture and Marie Curie discovered radium.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Cultural historian Richard Tarnas characterized the period this way:<br><br><i>Using his own natural intelligence, and without the aid of Holy Scripture's divine revelation, man had penetrated nature's mysteries, transformed his universe, and immeasurably enhanced his existence. .</i><i>.</i><i>. His own wits and will could change his world. Science gave man a new faith--not only in scientific knowledge, but in himself.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>This period of time gave rise to what is known as "the myth of progress"--that is, the idea that mankind was somehow destined to rise inexorably on this wave of scientific progress to a new Eden. So it was that on the eve of the First World War, as the quest for power and political dominance reared its ugly head yet again in Europe, the response was a sadly naïve one. If a war must be fought because of the aggression of certain nations, then it must be fought, but most saw it as "the war to end all wars." The belief was strong that the future was unquestionably bright.<br><br>However, World War I did not end all wars. The staggering cost of this war dealt a terrible blow to prewar optimism. World WarI was expected to be brief; however, it lasted for more than four years. "By the time of the Armistice, more than nine million soldiers lay dead and roughly thirty-seven million wounded."<sup>4</sup> New technologies such as machine guns, high-explosive shells, poison gas, and the movement of troops by railway meant that more men could be killed more efficiently than in any previous war. And they were.<br><br>On average, there were roughly 6,000 men killed every day of the war. Twenty-five percent of the young men in France died in the war. In the face of such overwhelming ­tragedy, Christianity seemed irrelevant to many Europeans and Americans.<br><br>Added to the blow of the terrible carnage of World War I came the death toll of Spanish influenza in 1918. It infected <i>half a billion people</i> and was estimated to have killed between 3 to 5 percent of the world's population, making it one of the deadliest diseases in human history.<br><br>To many of those living at that time, the cosmos seemed to be indifferent and uncaring. Many of the old celebrated values such as honor, sacrifice, and patriotism seemed hollow. The realities of the new type of war were staggering. The horror of seeing men blown apart and then seeing and smelling their corpses rot for weeks in the cold mud of the trenches tried the faith that had sent men to fight for king, for country, and for God.<br><br>As a result, the postwar decades of the 1920s and '30s were decades of disillusionment and cynicism. Faith in God was questioned widely and openly. The notion of inevitable progress was shattered and compounded by a feeling of helplessness and despair. Literature after the war reflected this bleak view, as in Ernest Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> and Erich Remarque's <i>All Quiet on the Western Front.</i><br><br>Many hoped that the lessons learned in World War I would prevent another world war. Nevertheless, just two decades later the world descended into a second global conflict. Not long after it ended, two works of literature appeared that went remarkably against the tide of despair. They were <i>The Chronicles of Narnia,</i> by C.S. Lewis, and the trilogy of <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien.<sup>5</sup> These two men had both been soldiers in World War I and had seen its death and horrors up close. Both men had lost many of their closest friends to the war, but, remarkably, neither succumbed to the cynicism and atheism that was so often the war's aftermath. Their stories celebrate courage, honor, brotherhood, and faith--especially faith.<br><br>What might we learn from these men as we also face a time when faith is ebbing from the world? Following the war, Lewis and Tolkien went on to become university professors. They taught a generation of students struggling to make sense of the world at a time when faith was openly questioned. These two men, who by that time had become fast friends, had an answer. Having come through this period with their own faith intact, they had a message for the next generation. The horrors of war had not manifested to them that faith in God had failed but rather that faith must be viewed in its proper setting. That proper setting was the fallen world in which those who have the precious gift of faith must fight for good against the combined forces of an enemy bent on their destruction.<br><br>One ever-present constant in their works is the reality of evil--indeed, a personified, ultimate enemy of all that is good. War did not evidence to Lewis and Tolkien that there was <i>no</i> God but that there <i>was</i> a devil. If we do have faith, then we must hold on to that faith in light of the constant struggle that goes on in the world between the light and "the Shadow," as Tolkien called it.<br><br>When my wife and I were raising our four children, we loved to read <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> to them. Perhaps you are familiar with the fantastical world of Narnia, where animals can talk and witches turn their enemies to stone. Narnia is discovered by four human children who find their way into it through a magical wardrobe. However, the power in these books derives not from flights of fantasy but from the compelling Christian symbolism that permeates them. Lewis conveys his own absolute belief in the reality of Jesus Christ through his creation of Aslan, the lion who serves as a redeemer for the world of Narnia. For Lewis, Christ was the most beautiful and important reality in our world.<br><br><i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is another fantasy classic that tells of a quest to destroy the powerful and evil One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. It too seems to be about creatures and places that never existed. And yet what has made it the most popular book in the twentieth century, second only to the Bible, is not its fantasy but its realism. It is not just about brave hobbits fighting the armies of Mordor but about the universal heroism of all of us--seemingly little people--who must fight against the evil of our own day in whatever way we can, calling on an inner strength we didn't know we had as we do our part in the great struggle that is always going on between ultimate good and ultimate evil.<br><br>Some contemporaries criticized these two literary calls to faith. They accused Lewis and Tolkien of hearkening after virtues of a world long past. The disillusioned men and women of the postwar generations were turning to other things--newer gods that promised to save mankind where the Christian and Hebrew gods had seemingly failed.<br><br>Communism was particularly alluring to the postwar generations. But whatever gains were made by the forced socialization of countries in the name of communism came at a terrible cost in human lives and human dignity. Millions died in purges and famine. In truth, more people died at the hands of communist dictators than died in both world wars.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Other war-weary souls turned to ­hedonism--the "eat, drink, and be merry"<sup>7</sup> philosophy that characterized the Roaring Twenties. We might lump in with this group the morally chaotic years that followed the so-called "sexual revolution" of the 1960s. But turning to the pleasures of the flesh has produced in our own time unprecedented levels of divorce and family breakdown, as it ­inevitably will.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest number of those ­disillusioned with the death of the old world order turned to science. Even though some thoughtful observers pointed out that it was science that had provided the efficient killing tools that made the two world wars so deadly, science still seemed to be an attractive ­solution. At least by applying the scientific method, many supposed, one could know truth with certainty.<br><br>People turned to Charles Darwin's evolutionary hypothesis to explain how we got here and to Sigmund Freud's theories to explain why people did what they did. However, ­science proved to be a disappointing god. We enjoy so many benefits from science, but it cannot provide the eternal truths by which toguide our lives. And it became apparent that scientists too were human--men and women who have the common weaknesses and frailties shared by all. Over time, science proved that it could be a worthy servant but that it made a poor master.<br><br>Into a world swirling with such alternatives to a seemingly discredited Christianity, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien sent their tales of heroic quests. Both works surprised ­critics with their popularity. It was as if they had splashed cold water on the faces of their readers, reminding the downhearted that the world had always been a place where good and evil fought for dominance in the human heart.<br><br>This <i>is</i> a fallen world. The scriptures call Satan "the prince of this world."<sup>8</sup> The works of both Lewis and Tolkien contained satanic figures who sought to cruelly dominate human beings--the White Witch in one case, Sauron in the other. What does mankind need in such a world? We need forces to counter the boundless evil and a hero to lead those forces. One of the attractions of Lewis' and Tolkien's works is this theme of our need for such a hero--a Savior, if you will. On their own, all the characters in the stories we identify with come to a point of their own failure. They need someone stronger than they are.<br><br>Surely part of the great appeal of <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy is the longing we discover within ourselves for a champion to fight those battles we cannot fight. Listen to the description of the hero Aragorn at the trilogy's ending. What does it sound like to you?<br><br><i>But when Aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. And then Faramir cried:</i><br><br><i>"Behold the King!</i><i>"</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>We can sometimes forget exactly what the great hope of Christianity is. It is not that Jesus Christ will fulfill all of our own natural aspirations for happiness. It is hope in a triumphant future that only God can and will provide.<br><br>We read in the Book of Mormon this advice from Alma:<br><br><i>And now</i> ... , <i>I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and </i><b><i>ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i></b><sup>10</sup><br><br>The triumph comes "at the last day." We too await the return of a King.<br><br>"In the New Testament's 260 chapters, Christ's return is mentioned no less than 318 times."<sup>11</sup> Clearly the Lord intended for us to think about this and to be ready for it. The chief metaphor of the New Testament relating to the Second Coming is that of a servant who is prepared for his or her master's return.<br><br>Each of us faces a choice. We can choose to see ourselves as the Lord's servants and humbly seek to know what He wants us to be doing with the talents and time He has given us. As such, we can seek to enlarge His kingdom and prepare it for His return. Or we may imagine that the story is <i>all about us.</i> Too many fall into this trap. They forget that they are His servants and begin to imagine that He is theirs. They think erroneously that Christ came to make all their dreams come true. For those in such a trap, prayer becomes like dropping memos on a desk in a heavenly office: "Could you please take care of this as soon as possible?"<br><br>In the Lewis and Tolkien stories, the good guys are always humble about the lives they find themselves living. They know that they are part of a larger story, and they seek to carry out that part with faithful hearts. Frodo once expressed his wish that he did not have to undertake such a difficult task as was given to him. "So do I," Gandalf replied, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."<sup>12</sup><br><br>Lewis and Tolkien rejected both a faithless view of life <i>and</i> an egocentric one. Their heroes understood that pain and loss would occur in this life but that ultimate victory would be theirs. In their stories, many are the defeats and great is the suffering that the truest servants endure while fighting for good in this world. In both Narnia and Middle Earth, hope was in the ultimate return of the king. You too find yourself in a world of conflict between good and evil. You too must decide what part you will play.<br><br>The quality of faith in Lewis' and Tolkien's works is not like the vague, undemanding spirituality that appears to be the preferred belief system of the millennial generation. It seems that no one wants to be labeled judgmental today, so our world has posited gods for itself that never judge and are never stern. They only affirm us and never deny us of anything we want.<br><br>But that is not what our friends Lewis and Tolkien believed. Especially in the figure of Aslan, Lewis described a loving but stern God who came to save us <i>from</i> our sins and not <i>in</i> our sins. As we raised our own children, my wife often told them, "Aslan is 'not a tame lion,'"<sup>13</sup> as a way to explain that we must come to eternal life on His terms, not our own. We must accept God's will for our lives even when we don't fully understand it. Listen to this interchange in <i>The Silver Chair,</i> one of the books in <i>The Chronicles of Narnia:</i><br><br><i>"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.</i><br><br><i>"I'm </i><b><i>dying</i></b><i> of thirst," said Jill.</i><br><br><i>"Then drink," said the Lion. ...</i><br><br><i>"Will you promise not to--do anything to me, ifIdo come?" said Jill.</i><br><br><i>"I make no promise," said the Lion.</i> ...<br><br><i>"</i><b><i>D</i></b><b><i>o</i></b><i> you eat girls?" she said.</i><br><br><i>"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it. .</i><i>.</i>.<br><br><i>"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."</i><br><br><i>"There is no other stream," said the Lion.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>And that is the gospel's message to your generation: "There is no other stream." Only one stream contains the water of eternal life. We find a similar metaphor in Lehi's vision of the tree of life. There is only one path that leads to the tree of life. The path is often obscured by mists of darkness emanating from an evil source. Without a hand on the iron rod, some wander in what are called strange paths--and our world is full of such paths. All who followed those paths were lost.<sup>15</sup> We must be humble enough to follow His path and not our own.<sup>16</sup><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, the enemy of your souls will entice you to take these strange paths, to devote your precious life <i>not</i> to building God's kingdom but to <i>any other cause.</i> From Satan's point of view, <i>any</i> cause will do if it diverts God's children from the one path that allows them to hold fast to the iron rod and thus receive ongoing revelation. This world is full of alternatives that, if they become one's primary focus, can crowd God Himself out of our lives--alternatives such as social media, fulfilling a bucket list, making lots of money, or having an obsession with sports or social causes. There are endless paths in our world other than the one that leads to the tree of life.<br><br>Lewis summed up the conclusion that William Law, an eighteenth-century clergyman, had come to: "If you have not chosen the Kingdom of God, it will make in the end no difference what you have chosen instead."<sup>17</sup> So please remember, there is a story line to this world's history. It is an epic tale. It involves a True King who is hidden from the world's sight for a time while His kingdom is ruled over by a wicked pretender to the throne who is a cruel despot who seeks to rule by war, blood, and horror. But the True King has true followers--humble servants who are able to see through all the lies and deceptions of the enemy and who seek to build allegiance to the True King. They seek to prepare a people who will be ready to receive Him when He comes in glory and defeats the false king, rewarding those who are looking forward to His coming.<br><br>I have spoken today about Lewis and Tolkien as examples of those who saw the ­ultimate reality behind all of this world's conflicts and inequities, its burdens and sorrows. They knew, as we read in Ether, that "good cometh of none save it be of [Jesus Christ]."<sup>18</sup> That is also my testimony.<br><br>As we enter the Christmas season, we celebrate the first coming of the Savior to this world. In one of our cherished sacrament hymns, we sing, "Jesus, once of humble birth," remembering how the King of Kings was born in a lowly stable. It is right that we celebrate that and teach our children to know the real reason we celebrate Christmas. But the song goes on:<br><br><i>Jesus, once of humble birth,</i><br><br><i>Now in glory comes to earth.</i><br><br><i>Once he suffered grief and pain;</i><br><br><i>Now he comes on earth to reign.</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>Once forsaken, left alone,</i><br><br><i>Now exalted to a throne.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>As you think of the Christ child this season, remember also the sequel to that story: the future return of the King. As you reflect on the stable in Bethlehem, keep alongside it this glorious vision:<br><br><i>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True. ...</i><br><br><i>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns.</i> ...<br><br><i>And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OFLORDS.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br><i>And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light. ...</i><br><br><i>And his voice shall be heard: I have trodden the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon all people. ..</i><i>.</i><br><br><i>And now the year of my redeemed is come; and they shall mention the loving kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his goodness, and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>If we are prepared for His coming--if we are looking for it--that day will be a great time of reunion and rejoicing. Make your choice, brothers and sisters, to use your time in the cause that matters most--the one that leads to the millennial reign of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I bear my testimony to you that He is the True King of this world. Jesus first came as the Christ child, a meek and lowly lamb who offered Himself for our sins. He is going to return in glory to receive the ­acknowledgment of every tongue and the homage of every knee.<sup>22</sup> May we prepare for the return of our King is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry Y.

<h1>urity and Spiritual Safety - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am honored to have the chance to speak to you today.<br><br>As you probably know, we are under attack by hackers and others seeking to steal our online identities or information. Some attacks in the news recently included Target, Home Depot, Sony, and the IRS. In one of the largest attacks, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management reported the theft of sensitive information from twenty-two million people--virtually anyone who had undergone a government background check in the last fifteen years. In addition, there are lots of online scams just waiting to trap us.<br><br>We are also under spiritual attack. As stated in 2 Nephi 2:27, Satan and his followers are doing everything that is possible to make us "miserable like unto" them. Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>It was revealed to me in the commencement of this Church, that the Church would spread, prosper, grow and extend, and that in proportion to the spread of the Gospel among the nations of the earth, so would the power of Satan rise</i>.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Recently President ThomasS. Monson stated, "Where once the standards of the Church and the standards of society were mostly compatible, now there is a wide chasm between us, and it's growing ever wider."<sup>2</sup> However, as threatening as this may seem, we also have been promised spiritual protection. Today I am going to speak about some ways to improve our computer-security behavior, and Iam going to offer some spiritual-behavior tips to keep us safe spiritually. While neither ofthese lists is complete, they are a good place to start.<br><h2><b>Security Warnings and Habituation</b></h2><br>As was mentioned, I am a professor in the Information Systems Department. I do research at the intersection of neuroscience and behavioral information security. Basically, my research team and I study what is going on in people's brains when they are interacting with security messages.<br><br>We have discovered some interesting things about how and why people behave the way they do in a computer-security setting. Our research shows that when computer users are exposed to a security message more than once, on the second--and on any following--­repetition, the brain saves energy by relying on memory rather than visually processing that security message on subsequent viewings.<br><br>The region at the back of the brain, called the occipital lobe, is responsible for visual processing and is one of the main areas in which we saw a decreased response over the repetitions. As you can guess, this is problematic because we are tuning out these messages without really seeing them. We have developed some variations on the security messages, and these variations cause the computer users' brains to pay attention. In this way--working <i>with</i> biology instead of against it--we can make users more secure by changing the software rather than by increasing the training for users.<br><br>In a sense, this habituation to security ­messages is like disregarding the ­promptings of the Holy Ghost. If we don't act on the promptings of the Holy Ghost, it can be harder for us to be aware of future promptings. We might even tune out the still small voice.<br><br>Elder RonaldT. Halverson said:<br><br><i>Many of us get so involved in our day-to-day tasks and worldly pursuits that we do not notice the many small miracles that constantly occur around us. This is one reason we may lose contact with the Holy Spirit and lose awareness of His promptings.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> . . . The Lord knows that unless we keep the commandments and pray daily and read the scriptures, the world and its influences can pull us away from the strait and narrow path and dull our senses to the whisperings of the Spirit.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>We must be spiritually in tune in order to recognize and be obedient to promptings when they come. We can spiritually prepare ourselves to receive and then respond to promptings of the Spirit in every situation. When we keep the commandments, He will tell us in our minds and hearts what we should do so that we can know the direction we need to go in our lives. "By the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things."<sup>4</sup><br><br>For most of us, it is not always easy to discern the whisperings of the Spirit, so it is something we need to work on daily. Through obedience we can receive protection, blessings, and insights.<br><h2><b>Phishing</b></h2><br>Computer users may receive emails that seem legitimate but are not. These are called phishing emails. They tend to offer some unearned benefit or may even trick us into providing information to fix a perceived mistake. Certainly most of us have heard of the Nigerian prince who just needs a little investment from us to be able to rescue his great wealth.<br><br>What is trickier, however, is the email that looks like it is from our bank or a company from which we purchased something online. Phishing email messages often include official-looking logos from real organizations and other identifying information taken directly from legitimate websites.<br><br>My colleagues and I did some research examining phishing emails. We used eye-tracking technology to capture what specific parts of the email messages the participants noticed. Unfortunately, most of our participants did not notice the suspicious parts of these emails.<br><br>Following are some best practices for avoiding being phished:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Don't click on links in email messages.</li><br> 	<li>Type addresses directly into your browser or use your personal bookmarks.</li><br> 	<li>Check the security certificate before entering personal or financial information into a website.</li><br> 	<li>Don't enter personal or financial information into pop-up windows.</li><br> 	<li>Learn to identify suspected phishing emails--watch for gifts or the loss of anexisting account.</li><br> 	<li>Check the source of information.</li><br></ul><br>Similarly, in today's world we are faced with all kinds of counterfeit happiness. It is so easy to become distracted and waste our precious time on mindless entertainment rather than to be engaged in worthwhile activities, such as scripture study or temple attendance.<br><br>President DieterF. Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>One of the adversary's methods to prevent us from progressing is to confuse us about who we really are and what we really desire.</i><br><br><i> We want to spend time with our children, but we also want to engage in our favorite ... hobbies. We want to lose weight, but we also want to enjoy the foods we crave. We want to become Christlike, but we also want to give the guy who cuts us off in traffic a piece of our mind.</i><br><br><i> Satan's purpose is to tempt us to exchange the priceless pearls of true happiness and eternal values for a fake plastic trinket that is merely an illusion and counterfeit of happiness and joy.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>An example of one of Satan's counterfeits is pride versus self-worth. Haughty pride is a temporary and poor substitute for a correct sense of one's own value. How about leisure and ease versus fulfillment?A common illusion in our day and age is that we can find happiness in a life of leisure and ease. The truth is that we are far more content when laboring daily in a cause we believe to be important enough to spend our entire lives on.<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 we read:<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i> And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated</i>.<br><br>About a hundred years ago Elder JamesE. Talmage wrote:<br><br><i>The present is an age of pleasure-seeking, and men are losing their sanity in the mad rush for sensations that do but excite and disappoint. In this day of counterfeits, adulterations, and base imitations, the devil is busier than he has ever been in the course of human history, in the manufacture of pleasures, both old and new; and these he offers for sale in most attractive fashion, falsely labeled, </i>"Happiness."<i> In this soul-destroying craft he is without a peer; he has had centuries of experience and practice, and by his skill he controls the market. He has learned the tricks of the trade, and knows well how to catch the eye and arouse the desire of his customers. He puts up the stuff in bright-colored packages, tied with tinsel string and tassel; and crowds flock to his bargain counters, hustling and crushing one another in their frenzy to buy.</i><br><br><i> Follow one of the purchasers as he goes off gloatingly with his gaudy packet, and watch him as he opens it. What finds he inside the gilded wrapping? He had expected fragrant happiness, but uncovers only an inferior brand of pleasure, the stench ofwhich is nauseating</i>.<sup>6</sup><br><br>Real joy and happiness come from living in such a way that our Heavenly Father will be pleased with us. As we learn in section 52 of the Doctrine and Covenants, humility and obedience help us understand the Lord's "pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations."<sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>Install Software Updates</b></h2><br>Another security tip is to keep your software up to date. Some security experts even say that applying software updates is one of the most important things you can do with your computer. If you don't update your software, you are very likely going to get some kind of malicious software in your system and even get hijacked. Virus writers, hackers, and other ill-intentioned individuals are constantly coming up with new and inventive ways to attack.<br><br>The majority of software updates are created to patch security vulnerabilities in programs. The odds are usually good that the update is made to protect against an attack that has already been detected. By updating and closing old holes, you are decreasing the number of known problems that attackers can use to get at you. Cybercriminals depend on the apathy of users regarding software updates to keep their malicious endeavors running. The good news is that most software updates aren't difficult to implement. In fact, many systems even allow for the updates to be managed automatically.<br><br>In the same way that keeping your software current helps keep you safe on your computer, keeping your temple recommend current helps keep you spiritually safe. President HowardW. Hunter was known for his emphasis on temple worthiness. He said:<br><br><i>To qualify for the blessings of the temple, each of us must ensure that our lives are in harmony with the teachings of the Church. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> You must believe in God the Eternal Father, in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the</i><i> </i><i>Holy Ghost.</i><i> </i><i>You must believe that this is their sacred and divine work. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> You must sustain the General Authorities and local authorities of the Church. .</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>.</i><br><br><i> . . . It is a commitment that you will follow the instructions that come from the presiding officers of the Church. Likewise you should feel loyalty toward the bishop and stake president and other Church leaders.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> You must be morally clean to enter into the holy temple.</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>.</i><br><br><i> You must ensure that there is nothing in your relationship with</i><i> </i><i>family</i><i> </i><i>members that is out of harmony with the teachings of the Church.</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>.</i><br><br><i> . . . You must be honest in all of your dealings with others. .</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>. Our basic integrity is at stake when we violate this covenant.</i><br><br><i> . . . You should strive to do your duty in the Church, attending your sacrament, priesthood, and other meetings. .</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>. Be active participants in your wards and branches, and be one your leaders can depend on.</i><br><br><i>. . . You must be a full-tithe payer and live the Word of Wisdom. .</i><b></b><i>.</i><b></b><i>. Observation over many years has shown that those who faithfully pay their ­tithing and observe the Word of Wisdom are usually faithful in all other matters that relate to entering the holy temple.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>We can commit now to keeping ourselves safe from spiritual attacks by living so as to be able to keep a current temple recommend.<br><h2><b>Back Up Your Files</b></h2><br>There is a devious new type of computer attack called ransomware. The most notorious version of this is called CryptoLocker. Through an email attachment, a program is installed on your computer that encrypts all of your files. Then you are instructed to pay a ransom to get the key to decrypt your files. So while all the data in your files are still on your computer, you will not be able to access any of them until you pay the ransom. Some victims have indicated that even after paying the ransom, they were still unable to recover their data. It is estimated that CryptoLocker extorted three million dollars from its victims in the first six months of operation.<br><br>Far more common situations of data loss are those due to accidental deletion or hardware failure. Probably most of us have experienced that. A good backup plan can protect us. Ideally you will have your files or your data in at least three places: the place where you work on them, a separate storage device, and off-site. Keep your files on your computer, back them up to an external hard drive, and then back them up in a different location. You can even back up your files to a cloud-based account such as Google Drive or Dropbox for free or for a small fee. It is good to establish a plan for keeping your backup files current.<br><br>In a way, computer backups can be compared to keeping a journal--a way of backing up our memories. We have been counseled to keep a journal. For example, President SpencerW. Kimball said:<br><br><i>Your journal is your autobiography, so it should be kept carefully. You are unique, and there may be incidents in your experience that are more noble and praiseworthy in their way than those recorded in any other life. There may be a flash of illumination here and a story of faithfulness there. . . .</i><br><br><i> . . . Begin today and write in it your goings and comings, your deepest thoughts, your achievements and your failures, your associations and your triumphs, your impressions and your testimonies. Remember, the Savior chastised those who failed to record important events.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br><i> </i>He also said, "This is what the Lord has commanded, and those who keep a personal journal are more likely to keep the Lord in remembrance in their daily lives<i>.</i>"<sup>10</sup><br><br>President Monson demonstrated the value of his journal keeping when he said:<br><br><i>I would like to share with you just a tiny sampling of the experiences I have had wherein prayers were heard and answered and which, in retrospect, brought blessings into my life as well as the lives of others. My daily journal, kept over all these years, has helped provide some specifics which I most likely would not otherwise be able to recount.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>President HenryB. Eyring placed an emphasis on using journals to document gratitude. He said:<br><br><i>Before I would write, I would ponder this question: "Have I seen the hand of God reaching out to touch us or our children or our family today?" As I kept at it, something began to happen. As I would cast my mind over the day, I would see evidence of what God had done for one of us that I had not recognized in the busy moments of the day. As that happened, and it happened often, I realized that trying to remember had allowed God to show me what He had done.</i><br><br><i> More than gratitude began to grow in my heart. Testimony grew. I became ever more certain that our Heavenly Father hears and answers prayers. I felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the Atonement of the Savior Jesus Christ. And I grew more confident that the Holy Ghost can bring all things to our remembrance--even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> My point is to urge you to find ways to recognize and remember God's kindness. It will build our testimonies.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>My current and former students may be laughing a little right now because for the past several years I have taken time during each class session for the students, and for myself, to document something for which they are grateful. Then we take some class time to share. Research shows that people who take time to do this are happier, healthier, and smarter. And, as noted by our Church leaders, this practice will bring us closer to the Lord and build our testimonies.<br><h2><b>Passwords</b></h2><br>Passwords are nearly ubiquitous in today's computing environment. Unfortunately, several of us may have insecure passwords that leave us vulnerable to hackers and identity theft. In fact, the most common passwords are "123456789" (sometimes only to 6 or 4) and the word <i>password.</i><br><br>A tip for better password security is to use unique passwords. This means having a different password for each account rather than reusing a password for multiple accounts. This is important because hackers can get lists of passwords used on websites that have been hacked. Hackers can test those listed passwords against other accounts and websites.<br><br>A related tip is to use strong passwords. This means having longer passwords that include upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. These types of passwords take longer for hackers to crack than words that are found in a dictionary. Some suggest using a phrase or a rhyme as a password. One of my passwords is "ain'tnobodygottimeforthat," which, ironically, takes a long time to type. But even my children can remember that password. We also joke about using the last eight digits of pi<i>.</i><br><br><i> </i>If you are like most people, you will have trouble remembering a whole list of unique and strong passwords without writing them down or storing them in a computer file, which can defeat the purpose of having secure passwords. There is a punch line in a comic strip that says, "Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Consequently, most security experts recommend using a password manager, which is software that securely keeps track of all your user accounts and passwords. I recently counted 211 accounts with passwords stored in my password manager. Some of the best password managers are LastPass, 1Password, or Roboform.<br><br>I think good password management is like prayer. Sometimes we may find ourselves with casual, short prayers that are essentially the same day after day. But we are spiritually safer when we take the time to have sincere prayer--long, complicated prayers. While simple prayers are a good thing, we periodically need to truly communicate with our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Elder DavidA. Bednar said:<br><br><i>Simply saying prayers is quite a different thing from engaging in meaningful prayer. I expect that all of us already know that prayer is essential for our spiritual development and protection. But what we know is not always reflected in what we do. And even though we recognize the importance of prayer, all of us can improve the consistency and efficacy ofour personal and</i><i> </i><i>family prayers.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball remarked:<br><br><i>I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear islistening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures, the distance narrows and spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more. I find it easier to abide their counsel.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>And what if we feel at times that we can't do it all? That's where the Atonement brings us peace. Far better than a password manager, the Atonement makes up for our shortcomings. We receive the blessings of the Atonement when we repent of our sins and keep the commandments.<br><br>In the words of Elder RichardG. Scott:<br><br><i>The Redeemer will safely lead you over the most difficult obstacles of life. His laws are absolutely secure anchors of protection that dispel fear and assure success in an otherwise dangerous world. Such a life will certainly provide you peace and happiness.</i><br><br><i> True, enduring happiness, with the accompanying strength, courage, and capacity to overcome the greatest difficulties, will come as you center your life in Jesus Christ.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>I am grateful for the all-encompassing power of the Atonement, which compensates for our inadequacies and provides us with peace, comfort, and courage.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In summary, for cybersecurity do the following:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Be attentive to security messages.</li><br> 	<li>Watch out for phishing emails.</li><br> 	<li>Keep your software up to date.</li><br> 	<li>Back up your files.</li><br> 	<li>Use strong, unique passwords and a ­password manager.</li><br></ul><br>And for spiritual safety do the following:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Be in tune with the Holy Ghost.</li><br> 	<li>Beware of counterfeit happiness.</li><br> 	<li>Keep a current temple recommend.</li><br> 	<li>Keep a journal.</li><br> 	<li>Engage in meaningful prayer.</li><br></ul><br>As we make and keep sacred covenants, we are blessed with power to withstand adversity, resist temptation, and enjoy a fulness of gospel blessings. Elder NealA. Maxwell taught, "If we will keep our covenants, the covenants will keep us spiritually safe."<sup>17</sup><br><br>President HaroldB. Lee said:<br><br><i>The only safety we have as members of this church is to ... learn to give heed to the words and commandments that the Lord shall give through his prophet. ... There will be some things that take patience and faith. You may not like what comes. ... It may contradict your political views. It may contradict your social views. It may interfere with some of your social life. But if you listen to these things, as if from the mouth of the Lord himself, ... "the gates of hell shall not prevail against you..., and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you...." (D&amp;amp;C 21:6).</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Let us be sure that the spiritual foundation for each of us is the rock of our Redeemer, as Helaman taught his sons:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>I testify that we have a loving Heavenly Father who has a plan for us to return to Him. Through obedience we can find happiness, safety, and peace.
